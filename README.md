# Simplifying Complexity: A Journey through Text Summarization

Welcome to the Simplifying Complexity GitHub repository! This repository contains a tutorial paper and accompanying code that takes you on a journey through the field of text summarization.

## Introduction

Text summarization plays a crucial role in condensing large volumes of information into concise and coherent summaries.  This tutorial paper aims to provide an in-depth exploration of extractive and abstractive text summarization techniques within the domain of deep learning, with a deeper exploration of the latter. 

## Installation and Usage

To get started with the tutorial paper and accompanying code, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Read through the tutorial paper (Tutorial Paper.pdf) provided in the root directory.
Follow along with the exercises and examples presented in the paper to gain a deeper understanding of text summarization techniques.
4. Navigate to the `codes` folder to access the implementation examples. Experiment with the code, modify parameters, and try out different datasets to reinforce your learning and explore the practical applications of text summarization.
