"potomac, maryland (cnn) -- to combat the depression and despair during her 105-day stint in iran's notorious evin prison, haleh esfandiari welcomed all distractions and blocked thoughts of her beloved home and family. haleh esfandiari talks to iranian media in front of evin prison after her august 21 release. the iranian-american scholar, who was charged with espionage and endangering iranian national security during a december visit to her family, wrote a book in her mind, read newspapers, watched television and exercised voraciously. ""i decided either i am going to succumb to despair or i am going to try to make the best of this condition, and the best of this condition was to have a disciplined day,"" she said. ""so i would exercise for many hours, i would read, i would walk a lot, some three to four hours a day -- even in the room, you know, i would pace up and down timing myself."" the 67-year-old grandmother of two said dwelling on her incarceration, and longing for her family, was disheartening ""so that's why i plunged into exercising, and i wrote a book in my mind on the history and life story of my grandmother. as i would be walking, i would write chapters and edit them in my mind and rewrite it the next day."" watch an 'elated' esfandiari explain how she passed the time » esfandiari said she was treated ""with respect"" while at evin, but added, ""a prison is a prison."" esfandiari was allowed to go home last week. she returned to potomac, maryland, on thursday and discussed her arrest and captivity during a saturday interview. though she said she's unsure why she was jailed in evin's political wing, esfandiari believes her iranian captors wanted to know more about the woodrow wilson center for international scholars, the washington-based think tank where she heads the middle east program. ""i think they were trying to found out more about the wilson center -- what it really does, were trying to find out about think tanks in america, foundations in america, the relationship between think tanks, foundations and the government,"" she said. on december 21, the dual iranian-american national traveled to iran to visit her 93-year-old mother, where she visited for nine days. on december 30, she caught a taxi to the airport where she planned to fly home to washington. those plans were altered by three knife-wielding men who stopped her cab, threatened to kill her and stole her luggage and handbag, which contained both of her passports and her airline ticket. esfandiari called her husband, shaul bakhash, back home in maryland and told him to cancel her credit cards and report the stolen passport. the next day, she went to the authorities. ""i went to the passport office, and they said that they would like to, somebody wants to talk to you. and that was the beginning of the saga,"" she said. that somebody, according to the wilson center, was an official with iran's ministry of intelligence. beginning on january 4, esfandiari was subjected to weeks of interrogations, sometimes as many as four a week and some lasting as long as eight hours, according to the wilson center. the questioning, the center said, was ""unpleasant and not free from intimidation and threat."" she was pressured to make confessions and falsely implicate the wilson center. she once received a threatening phone call. on january 18, she awoke from a nap at her mother's home to find her interrogator and two men -- one of them wielding a video camera -- staring into her bedroom, the wilson center said. on february 17, the interrogations stopped, but in late april or early may she again began receiving phone calls from the iranian government. on may 7, she was asked to go to the ministry of intelligence the following morning, according to the wilson center. when she arrived, she was put in a car and taken to evin prison. over the next two weeks, iranian media reported that esfandiari was accused of trying to topple the iranian government. later that month, a judiciary spokesperson announced that she was charged with espionage, actions against national security and propaganda against the islamic republic. ""it was puzzling for me at first,"" esfandiari told cnn. ""i think there is a concern among certain elements that the united states has planned some kind of velvet revolution in iran, and since they are bogged down in iraq and afghanistan, they won't do it through military. they would do [it] through think tanks and foundations to create a network of people to undermine the regime. i think that is their concern."" the velvet revolution is the name given to the 1989 bloodless coup that saw czechoslovakia's communist regime overthrown. in prison, esfandiari was interviewed for an iranian state television documentary, in which she allegedly linked u.s. think tanks and nongovernmental organizations with a ""soft revolution"" against the iranian government. the wilson center quickly denounced the documentary as ""scripted, contrived, and completely without merit."" the center's president and director, lee hamilton, who has served on the 9/11 commission and iraq study group, also issued a statement, saying the documentary took ""the fabrication of news to a new art form. this is shameful. it cannot be considered a 'confession' by any stretch of the imagination."" hamilton had written letters to president mahmoud ahmadinejad and majlis speaker shouray-e-islami, to no avail. on june 29, he wrote another letter to grand ayatollah ali khamenei, the supreme leader of iran, pleading for his help in esfandiari's case. a week later, the former congressman met in new york with iran's representative to the u.n., who delivered a written response from khamenei. the letter, which ""was positive and conveyed respect,"" marked the first time the ayatollah had responded to an american leader, according to the wilson center. esfandiari said she believes she owes her freedom, in part, to hamilton's letter. the iranian government never said why esfandiari was allowed to go home, but on august 21 she was released on a bail of 3 billion iranian rials ($320,000). esfandiari picked up her passport september 1 and flew to vienna, austria, where her sister lives, the next day. she arrived in the united states on thursday. ""the first thing i did, i walked around, walked into the kitchen and started looking at things and say, 'ok, where is this? this shouldn't be here! that shouldn't be there!' "" she said. ""and shaul goes, 'there she goes again.' "" esfandiari said she is ""elated to be home."" ""sleeping in my own bed after eight months, taking a shower in my own bathroom after eight months, walking around the garden,"" she said. ""to see my grandchildren who have grown since i last saw them in those eight months. so it is a fantastic -- it is a fantastic feeling -- and looking back, i am glad this nightmare is over."" e-mail to a friend","haleh esfandiari says she read, walked, wrote a book in her mind while in prison"
"-- north korean and south korean military units exchanged gunfire near their border friday, south korean authorities said. no casualties were reported. the exchange happened after north korean forces fired two rounds from a 14.5 millimeter machine gun at a south korean military guard post near the border town of chorwon, south korea, about 73 miles (118 km) northeast of seoul, according to an official at the joint chiefs of staff. the south korean unit responded with three ""warning shots"" from a .50-caliber machine gun and warned the north korean guard post by loudspeaker to desist, the official said. the demilitarized zone at the location of the shooting is 1.3 kilometers (0.8 miles) wide. chorwon was the scene of heavy fighting during the 1950-53 korean war. north korea on friday threatened to retaliate against its neighbor for shunning bilateral military talks. the gunfire exchange apparently won't cancel reunions of families separated by the korean war, which ended in a truce but no formal peace treaty. the weeklong reunions begin saturday at mount kumgang, the two countries' joint mountain resort in the north. north korea has requested record shipments of rice and fertilizer in exchange for concessions on the reunions, the south korean yonhap news agency reported earlier this week. while there are occasional shooting incidents across the demilitarized zones, the tensest flash point on the peninsula in recent years has been the disputed maritime border in the yellow sea. there were fatal naval clashes there in 1999 and 2002. in march this year, the sinking of a south korean vessel killed 26 in what a south korean and international investigation team concluded was a north korean torpedo attack. north korea continues to deny involvement. the prickly relationship between the countries since the korean war has had periodic conciliatory moves and flare-ups. friday's incident occurred two weeks before the g-20 summit in seoul. the g-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination. authorities said a total of 50,000 police and riot police will be deployed during the summit on november 11 and 12, according to yonhap. journalist andrew salmon contributed to this report.","the incident was at the border of north korea, south korea"
"-- a 2-year-old boy who authorities say was abducted by a stranger saturday following a home invasion robbery that ended in a double homicide has been found, police in virginia said. the suspect fled the scene, stealing a vehicle that was idling near the home, authorities said. the toddler, identified as kaiden gage burnside, was inside the vehicle, they said. ""the car and the child have been recovered,"" said lt. ronnie armstead, a spokesman for the richmond police department. the identities of the shooting victims were not released and it was not immediately known what relation, if any, they had to the missing boy. the suspect has no relation to the child, armstead said. authorities have put together the events of the alleged home invasion and shooting through the statements of a witness who was inside the house at the time of the shooting, armstead said. that witness was not related to the suspect nor man and woman who were killed, he said. police have issued an arrest warrant for jamal clemons, 27, on suspicion of abduction, robbery, robbery with a firearm, using a firearm in the commission of a felony and a felon being in possession of a firearm, armstead said. cnn's maria white contributed to this report.",new: police say a 2-year-old boy they say was abducted has been found
"-- one suspect has been arrested in connection to a pair of car bombings that killed at least 45 people in northern lebanon, the state-run national news agency reported. shiekh ahmed al-ghareeb was seen on surveillance camera in al-salam mosque in the site of the explosion. security forces raided his home in al-minye and seized some military machine guns and some grenades, according to the news agency. the blasts friday in tripoli occurred near mosques run by sunni imams with ties to syrian rebels. while some lebanese sunnis have gone to neighboring syria to fight alongside those trying to unseat president bashar al-assad's government, shiites from lebanon's hezbollah group are fighting in support of the embattled leader. even before authorities had given indications as to who was behind the bombing, members of the lebanese parliament from tripoli issued a statement friday night blaming ""treacherous hands that strive to import the regional blaze into lebanon,"" nna reported. the legislators also called on tripoli residents to show restraint and cooperate with security officials. in addition to the deaths, at least 500 people were reported injured in the blasts, which the national news agency reported. the first one occurred near the sunni al taqwa mosque and the second was, minutes later, near al salam mosque. this latter explosion was close to the residences of acting prime minister najib mikati and ashraf rifi, the former head of the country's internal security forces. rifi is widely despised by hezbollah and lebanese politicians friendly to al-assad, the syrian president. this bomb produced a crater 5 meters (16.4 feet) across, incinerated more than 60 cars and damaged six residential buildings, the news agency said. mikati issued a statement via twitter condemning the bombings. ""we urge our children and brothers in tripoli to practice self-restraint, and we pledge to them that we will always stand by them, especially during these critical times,"" he said. tammam salam, the man designated to become lebanon's next prime minister, cut short a private trip to greece after the blasts. ""the crime of tripoli is further evidence that the situation in lebanon reached a very critical stage and requires us to be on high alert on the political, national and security levels in order to eradicate the internal strife,"" he said. hezbollah said, in its own statement, that the explosions were part of a ""criminal scheme aimed at sowing seeds of strife among the lebanese."" a car bombing in a southern suburb of beirut earlier this month rocked a hezbollah stronghold, killing at least 22 people and injuring hundreds. fears of religious warfare are potent in lebanon, where a civil war between christian and pro-palestinian muslim militias killed an estimated 150,000 people from 1975 until 1990. cnn's michael pearson, nada husseini, and hamdi alkhshali contributed to this report.","new: suspect seen on surveillance camera in al-salam mosque, state news says"
"-- iranian authorities have moved imprisoned american saeed abedini to a more dangerous prison and are now prohibiting visits from the family of the christian pastor, according to the public interest law firm representing abedini's family in the united states. abedini, 33, is an iranian-born u.s. citizen who makes his home in boise, idaho, with his wife and two small children. he converted to christianity from islam. in the islamic republic of iran, a muslim who converts to another faith can face the death penalty. abedini was arrested in june 2012 during a visit to his native country. in a news release, the american center for law and justice (aclj) said that one of abedini's iranian family members went to visit him at evin prison in tehran on sunday and was told that abedini had been moved the previous day to rajai shahr prison near karaj. the family member then made the hour-and-a-half drive to karaj and was told that abedini was not permitted to receive visitors. the aclj pointed out that the transfer occurred at the same time demonstrators in iran were chanting, ""death to america!"" in rallies observing the anniversary of iranian protestors seizing the u.s. embassy in tehran in 1979. u.s. secretary of state john kerry says iran has detained abedini since sept. 26, 2012, sentencing him to eight years in prison, ""on charges related to his religious belief."" kerry has called for iran to release him. appearing on cnn's ""the lead with jake tapper,"" on september 24, near the one year anniversary of his imprisonment, abedini's wife, naghmeah, said, ""his charge was undermining the iranian government, the basis for the charge was christian gatherings."" she said that at the time of abedini's arrest, he was in iran with that government's permission to build a nonsectarian orphanage on his parent's property. she said that he had worked with house churches on visits prior to the one during which he was arrested. u.s. president barack obama also has called for abedini's release. on september 27, obama spoke by phone with iranian president hassan rouhani when rouhani was in the united states for a speech at the united nations. the call was the first time presidents from the two nations have spoken directly since the u.s. severed diplomatic ties with iran following the islamic revolution and the seizing of hostages at the u.s. embassy in tehran. a senior official in the administration told cnn that the president ""noted our concern about three american citizens who have been held within iran -- robert levinson, saeed abedini, and amir hekmati -- and noted our interest in seeing those americans reunited with their families."" levinson, a retired fbi agent, vanished during a business trip to iran in march 2007. amir hekmati is a former u.s. marine who was jailed in iran in 2011, with the iranian government accusing him of espionage faraz sanei, iran researcher with human rights watch, said that ""prisoners of conscience"" incarcerated at rajai shahr prison are comingled with violent offenders, such as those serving time for murder convictions. he also cited reports of overcrowding, lack of running water, lack of heat in the winter, and negligence on the part of jailers. he said prisoners regularly do not receive needed medical care, and some have staged hunger strikes in an effort to receive more humane treatment. regarding saeed's case sanei said, ""saeed abedini is among the dozens of iranian christians who have been subjected to surveillance, harassment, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and unlawful convictions during the past few years because of the iranian government's crackdown on christian converts and the home church movement. ""iran's judiciary should immediately free abedini and others like him, and allow iran's christian community, and particularly members of the country's besieged home church movement, to practice their faith free from government interference.""","authorities have moved iranian-american pastor, saeed abedini to a more dangerous prison"
"(cnn)americans will spend about $550 million on self-help books this year and more than $1 billion on motivational speakers. obviously, many of us are on a quest for happiness. i get it. we all want, and deserve, that sense of well-being. but save your money. achieving happiness is easier than you may think. we all experience emotional highs throughout our lives -- with a job promotion, on our wedding day, with the birth of a child. but these moments only yield temporary feelings of elation, and experts say that they alone are not enough to achieve true happiness. happiness isn't just an emotional state. decades of research proves it goes much deeper. in fact, science shows people who are happy live longer and healthier lives. the good news is that generating better bliss is something we can all do regardless of our environment or genetics. here are seven ways to boost your life satisfaction: start by changing your attitude. that's right -- i'm talking to you, pessimists. a harvard university study found that optimists are not only happier but are 50% less likely to have heart disease, a heart attack or a stroke. it turns out that keeping a positive outlook actually offers protection against cardiovascular disease. the science doesn't fare as well for pessimists. they have lower levels of happiness compared with optimists and are three times as likely to develop health problems as they age, researchers say. learn from people who are already happy. denmark has earned the top spot on the european commission's ""eurobarometer"" for well-being and happiness every year since 1973. and when the united nations went on the hunt for the happiest nation in the world, it ranked denmark no. 1. so what makes danes more satisfied with their lives? sure, things like life expectancy, gross domestic product and a low-corruption rate help. but the overall level of happiness in denmark has more to do with the generosity that's common among citizens, their freedom to make life choices and a strong social support system, according to the u.n. world happiness report. copenhagen: the world's happiest city work less. the danes seem to strike a great work-life balance, which ups their happiness level. simply put: they don't overwork. in fact, the average workweek in denmark is 33 hours -- only 2% of danes work more than 40 hours a week. almost 80% of mothers in denmark return to work after having a child, but they balance their free time between families, weekly happy hour with their girlfriends and participating in community club programs. focus on experiences. danes also pay less attention to gadgets and things and more attention to building memories. studies show that people who focus on experiences over ""things"" have higher levels of satisfaction, long after the moment of the experience has passed. too much stuff tends often leads to debt, not to mention the time and stress associated with keeping up all those gadgets, cars, properties, clothes, etc. researchers say when people focus on experiences, they feel a greater sense of vitality or ""being alive"" during the experience and afterward. it also brings you mentally closer to the people around you, which may contribute to your happiness boost. build up your social network. by simply being social, you could slow down your biological age. research shows that a strong social support system can lengthen our telomeres. telomeres are the tiny caps on our dna chromosomes that indicate our cellular age. according to experts, no friends can equal shorter telomeres and, in turn, a shorter life. other studies have showed that loneliness leads to higher rates of depression, health problems and stress. solution: have at least one close friend to boost your happiness level and health. volunteer. people who volunteer are happier with their lives than those who don't, according to dozens of studies. the united nations even credits volunteerism as one of the reasons denmark is the happiest nation in the world -- 43% of danes regularly give back to their community, compared with 25% of americans. the joy of helping others starts early. a 2012 study found children prefer to give than to receive. researchers gave two groups of toddlers snacks and then asked one group to give their treats away. the children who gave away their treats showed greater happiness about sharing their possessions, suggesting that the act of personal sacrifice was emotionally rewarding, researchers say. the sacrifice doesn't have to be big -- previous research has found that donating or spending as little as $5 on others has emotional benefits. experts say we are all inherently compassionate. performing acts of kindness, volunteering time and donating money increases happiness by improving your sense of community, purpose and self-image. just start laughing. research shows that laughing doesn't just signal happiness, it produces it. when we laugh, our stress hormones decrease and our endorphins rise. endorphins are the same brain chemicals associated with the ""runner's high"" you get from exercise. live to 100: laugh more laughing is also good for your heart. a study found that only 8% of heart patients who were made to laugh daily had a second heart attack within a year, compared with 42% of the non-laughers. studies show our bodies can't differentiate between fake and real laughter; you'll get the health boost either way. so you can even fake it until you make it. laugh in your car, in the shower -- force yourself to start laughing a few minutes every day.",science shows happy people live longer and healthier lives
"-- forget the macho world of the standard shoot-'em up video game. rather than relying on blood, gore and mayhem, a number of game developers are tapping into their inner emotions, inviting gamers along for adventures of the psyche. recent releases ""tomb raider"" and ""bioshock infinite"" evoked an emotional response by creating characters with which gamers could identify and empathize. now ""the last of us"" ups the stakes with its story of two people surviving in a post-apocalyptic world -- joel, a grizzled man who has seen too much, and ellie, a young girl who could be the future of the world. ""the thing we heard consistently (from focus groups) was 'i've never cared for characters as much as i've cared for joel and ellie,' "" naughty dog creative director neil druckmann told cnn. ""there are moments we want to show close-ups, we want to show really subtle performances, and that's where cut scenes are really useful. but we really use interaction to get you to connect, between ellie and joel, in a way you couldn't do in film."" it's an increasingly popular approach in a segment of gaming where ammo and attitude have traditionally reigned supreme. in ""tomb raider,"" players journeyed with a young and unsure lara croft through an early adventure in her career. they got to experience her anguish and joy as the star of the long-running franchise made her first kill or rescued close friends. with ""bioshock infinite,"" an entire team was devoted to bringing the elizabeth character to life. that level of care and precision resulted in a character who evoked a visceral response from the player -- one so real, designers said, that gamers would feel like they're part of something larger than playing a game. ""the last of us"" designers at naughty dog wanted to bring different elements together to get gamers to feel attached to joel and elle. it had to be more than just intense moments, they said; it needed to come together seamlessly and sell their relationship to the player. the game action is centered on a fungal outbreak that possesses humans and transforms them into ... well, zombies. joel is older and has seen life on both sides of the outbreak. ellie, just 14, was born into the post-outbreak world. their different viewpoints on life and how it should be lived were important to developing the relationship between the two characters. ""how much we dedicate to those characters and building those characters and have those characters shift and change and go through these dynamic arcs and the gameplay supports that,"" studio director bruce straley said. ""they feed off each other."" early reactions suggest the dynamic works. ""we've had people cry when playing the game for us,"" druckmann said. ""there are about three spots in the game where people cry. two of those are in cut scenes, and one of those is in game play."" he said he thinks the gameplay scene is the most powerful. ""you are so invested in the characters, and you're using these mechanics and then all of the sudden ... i can't say too much without spoiling it, but we flip a mechanic on its head and it doesn't do what you expect because of where the characters are at,"" druckmann said. ""you see people just lose it, and it's awesome."" straley and druckmann said they used different literary sources as inspiration for the game's emotional journey. one movie, in particular, struck a chord with both. ""we came out of 'no country for old men' mouth agape, wide-eyed, going, 'oh my god, what just happened?' and 'could you ever experience that tension and emotion in a video game? can you achieve that with a joystick in your hand?' "" straley said. ""in this world, anything can happen, and you as the player get to control that outcome and feel that tension."" but are gamers looking to cry over their characters? is there a danger of turning off gamers because they may get too emotionally involved? both ""tomb raider"" and ""bioshock infinite"" garnered commercial and critical success, suggesting that hard-core players are open to more than just another shooter. each asked the player to take a fresh look at some familiar gaming situations, using the main characters as a canvas on which to create the experience. ""the last of us"" similarly asks players to tackle a challenging question -- in the horrible circumstances in which many games are set, how do you find, and define, your humanity? ""that's what all good true drama is based on -- that conflict and difficult choices and the human experience,"" straley said. druckmann said he wants players to come away thinking about deep issues, such as the dynamics of relationships and what it takes to keep them alive. ""you sit down. you play the game and you're going to have moments,"" he said. ""that's what we've set out to do. we want to give people moments."" ""the last of us"" is available worldwide. the game is a playstation 3 exclusive title. it is rated m for mature due to blood and gore, intense violence, sexual themes and strong language.","in new top video games, designers are working hard to move players emotionally"
"-- waiting in a parked car in the ninth ward as the rain pounds down, i cannot help but think about the flood in the movie, ""the curious case of benjamin button."" it's a natural, because i am only a stone's throw from where the levee broke, and i am here to meet the star of that movie, brad pitt, as the finale to our ""building up america"" tour. the actor targeted this area some years ago with his make it right foundation -- an ambitious plan to build up the shattered neighborhood with new, ecologically friendly, affordable houses, and then fill them with residents who had been driven out by katrina. when the rain backs off a bit, i hustle into one of the raised houses, where my tv crew is busy setting up lights on a covered upper deck. nbc is also there, but in a different area. i spend a few minutes chatting with brian williams. we've known each other for years and share a lot of friends, and it's always nice catching up. after a while, he asks, ""who's going first on this?"" i respond, ""you are."" he goes to get ready, and i look at the houses arrayed all around us. they are architectural marvels -- striking designs of unexpected angles, bright colors and green innovations: solar panels on the roofs, energy-saving appliances, rainwater collection systems. they don't look like anything else you'll see in the ninth ward, but when pitt finishes with brian and comes up the stairs, no one is looking at the architecture. ""hi, brad."" ""hi, tom."" he shakes my hand, flashes that famous smile, and his eyes twinkle (i'm no star chaser, but i swear, they really do). he takes a quick sip from the coffee cup he's carrying as we settle in to talk. ""you have set for yourself a very ambitious project in taking on a very difficult problem,"" i say. ""five years in, how do you think you're doing?"" ""these houses here have exceeded my expectations,"" he says, looking across the neighborhood. ""the goal here was how do you build affordable housing that's high-performance, and that is going to be strong enough to withstand the kind of weather that we're seeing down here. things that drive the price up, we've got to get down."" mindful of how such plans often go, i say, ""i'm guessing your first units here cost a lot more than your later ones."" ""sure, but now we're down to dollar-for-dollar what it costs to build anything else here,"" pitt says. when asked how he did that, pitt replies, ""we had to start over. we thought we could do it better. we thought we could build a house with light and high-performance technology, that we could bring bills down and give the families who live here a better life, and we wanted to prove it at the low income level. ""and now every house you see here, last month, every one but one was producing more energy than it was consuming. that's big news. that's a game-changer. and there is no reason to build any other way now,"" pitt says. pitt says he also wants to spread this idea beyond this neighborhood, looking into other areas in the u.s. and even abroad. donations from all over the country have fueled the first part of the project. pitt acknowledges he hasn't made it very far on that next step. ""you know this neighborhood was built on the kindness of strangers,"" he says, quoting ""a streetcar named desire."" ""the old desire public housing project stood not far from where we are. for this to go on, it has to be on the governmental level. ""they have to look at this and set new practices, and new [building] codes. but in the meantime, with more donations now, we could get into other parts of the city,"" he says. ""these people are pioneers here, and they have built the greenest neighborhood in the world. and i see this as a template that will work in any climate, any condition."" pitt's love for new orleans dates back to when he shot ""interview with the vampire,"" in the mid-1990s. but his excitement for this project is obvious -- enough so that i wonder if it is taking over as the central interest in his life. we were told repeatedly by pitt's handlers that he really doesn't like talking about his famous partner, angelina jolie, and their children. i wasn't here to ask about his movie career, but oddly enough, as we end our chat, both subjects come up. i look out over the houses he's brought to this troubled part of town and ask, ""could you see yourself at any point giving up acting to do this?"" he pauses a moment, the way celebrities do when they encounter a question they have not been asked before. ""um, sure,"" he says hesitantly; then, warming to the idea of giving up the grind of being a movie superstar, ""i'm quite excited by this idea of building a future and the direction that we're going. i'm getting older anyway. i see doing that less and less."" i laugh. ""you'll have to have something to pass your time."" ""oh, i've got plenty of things to pass my time,"" he says, and in a reference to the famous family brood, adds, ""six of them.""",brad pitt's make it right foundation builds eco-friendly homes in area hit by katrina

"-- life is slowly getting back to normal at the women's campus of islamabad's international islamic university. the young women who study here chatter on the school's well-manicured lawns, their brightly-colored scarves and pakistani dresses blowing in the wind on a sunny autumn day. barely three weeks ago, this quiet place of learning was the scene of a nightmare. on october 20, two suicide bombers launched near simultaneous attacks on both the men's and women's side of the campus. afsheen zafar, 20, is in mourning. three of her classmates, girls she describes as ""shining stars,"" were killed on that terrible day. still, she says the carnage could have been much worse if not for the actions of a lowly janitor, who was also killed. ""if he didn't stop the suicide attacker, there could have been great, great destruction,"" zafar says. ""he's now a legend to us,"" says another 20-year-old student named sumaya ahsan. ""because he saved our lives, our friends' lives."" the janitor's name was pervaiz masih. according to eyewitness accounts, the attacker approached disguised in women's clothing. he shot the guard on duty, and then approached the cafeteria, which was packed with hundreds of female students. masih intercepted the bomber in the doorway, however, and the bomber self-detonated right outside the crowded hall, spraying many of his explosive vest's arsenal of ball bearings out into the parking lot instead of into the cafeteria. ""the sweeper who was cleaning up here saw someone outside and went towards him,"" said nasreen siddique, a cafeteria worker who was wounded in the head, leg and arm by the blast. ""[masih] told him that he could not come inside because there were girls inside. and then they started arguing. and then we heard a loud blast and all the glass broke."" ""between 300 to 400 girls were sitting in there,"" said professor fateh muhammad malik, the rector of the university. ""[pervez masih] rose above the barriers of caste, creed and sectarian terrorism. despite being a christian, he sacrificed his life to save the muslim girls."" masih was a member of pakistan's christian minority, traditionally one of the poorest communities in the country. when the attacker struck, masih had been on the job for less than a week, earning barely $60 a month. masih lived with seven other family members, in a single room in a crowded apartment house in the city of rawalpindi. until the attack his mother, 70-year old kurshaid siddique, worked as a cleaning lady at a nearby house to help make ends meet. now, she makes a daily pilgrimage to the cemetery where masih is buried. siddique is inconsolable. asked if she was proud that some people were calling her son a hero, siddique waved a hand in the air dismissively, answering, ""my hero is dead now."" she pulls out a framed photo of her son, pictured wearing a button down white shirt and a thick mustache. when masih's three-year-old daughter diya sees his photo, she reaches for it, saying, ""mama, i want that picture."" from time to time, diya turns to her mother and repeats one word, ""papa."" the islamic university offered to give diya a free education and employ masih's widow, shaheen pervaiz. meanwhile, the pakistani government has promised to award masih's family 1 million rupees (about $12,000) for his bravery. ""he is a national hero because he saved the life of many girls,"" said shahbaz bhatti, minister of minorities in the pakistani government. ""as a christian, a person of minority, he stood in front of the taliban to protect the university."" but the grave of this national hero is a sorry sight. it is located in the poorer, garbage-strewn christian half of a neighborhood cemetery, less then three feet from a muddy road. masih's mother and widow visit every day. one of his sisters crosses herself, then stoops down to pick up an empty pack of cigarettes someone threw onto the little mound of earth. the family had to borrow money to pay for masih's funeral and they are now behind on paying the rent. if the government money comes through, masih's mother would like to decorate her son's grave. ""i would like him to have his name in cement with a nice poetry verse,"" she says.

"-- for first-timers in a korean bathhouse, stripping naked and soaking for hours in tubs with strangers often comes as a jolt. the scrub corner in any jjimjilbang (korean bathhouse/sauna/spa/adult playground) is the section newbies find most alarming. this is because the scrub corner traffics in a completely different kind of naked intimacy -- one in which a grumpy korean woman in black lace underwear uses a coarse towel to scrub every corner of her guest/victim's body. for most, it's a punishing, yet oddly satisfying experience. it lasts about 40 minutes -- or a few minutes longer than you'd find yourself in the ring for a championship prizefight. good korean scrub the intense korean cleansing process (called ""seshin"") entails soaking the body in hot water, then rubbing it with a ""korean italy towel"" -- a colorful, thin loofah with a sandpaper-like texture -- to rid the body of all the gunk, dirt and layers of dead skin that accumulate naturally. rolls of dark, gray skin fall away as the ddemiri (scrub mistress) works away, revealing soft, pink layers of skin underneath. it's an extraordinarily rejuvenating -- and, again, painful -- process that locals embrace as a weekly ritual with family and friends. men and women have separate bathing areas and get scrubbed by members of their own gender. gaining traction korean scrubbing rituals have typically been embraced by few westerners -- assorted hollywood stars have gone in for quick sessions in la's koreatown. otherwise, the technique is largely unknown. over the past year or so, however, according to seoul's dragon hill spa head of public relations hyun-kyu sang, the number of foreigners coming for scrubs is increasing. ""we've been noticing tourists coming to korea and staying two nights at a hotel, and one night here, at the spa,"" says sang, explaining that many foreign visitors opt for package deals that included a seshin option. ""a lot of tourists come to korea and come here first, with their luggage, and get scrubbed to start their visit,"" he says. is the korean-style scrub on its way to becoming the next global beauty trend? if it is, we want to be among the first to check it out. that's why we went to seoul to ask the best scrub mistresses for tips on getting the most out of a scrub session. 1. don't touch the shower gel while many bring their own fancy shower gel to the bathhouse to lather up before the scrub, it turns out that bar soap, not the liquid kind, is actually the way to go. ""use the soap provided by the bathhouses during the pre-scrub shower and soak,"" says kim jung yeol, who's been a scrub mistress at the dragon hill spa in yongsan, seoul, for more than a decade. ""if you use body shampoo, the skin gets too slippery to scrub properly, and the 'dde' (dead skin rolls) doesn't come off nearly as well."" 2. soak for 30 minutes in medium-hot water impatient scrubees bolt out of soaking tubs after five or 10 minutes. korean grandmothers stay in tubs seemingly for hours. but the optimal length for a pre-scrub soak is 30 minutes. soaking in hotter water causes the skin to wrinkle faster (a good thing), but according to a gaggle of ddemiri (scrub mistress) at geumgansan sauna in hapjeong, customers should stay in the water temperature they're most comfortable with, instead of attempting a hotter tub and calling it a day after a few minutes. ""staying in the water to prune is most important,"" says one ddemiri. 3. be completely bare this one may seem obvious, but scrub mistresses say many of their customers come to them without removing everything. this includes rings, earrings, glasses and other accessories. those with long hair should bring their own hair-tie -- the ddemiri will tie their hair in a perfect bun. 4. seriously, relax ""relax!"" is the instruction issued most often by the ddemiri. if the body is too rigid, the scrub mistress can't contort it into the positions necessary to get at every nook and cranny. it's awkward and painful at first, but forcing the body to relax its muscles allows the ddemiri to get things done most effectively. ""usually customers listen and then they end up having a lot of fun,"" says jung. 5. the fun should come afterward this one surprises locals as well as foreigners. though some think sitting in a spa's various hot rooms before a scrub is an effective way to get the skin ready, ddemiris advise getting scrubbed before relaxing. ""if customers get scrubbed first and then go to the hot rooms, they'll feel more refreshed, since the sweat isn't blocked by dirty pores,"" says jung. ""then all they have to do after is rinse off in the shower."" 6. scrub weekly scrubs should be booked once a week. any more often, and there's danger of over-exfoliation. but according to jung, weekly scrubs improve skin vibrancy and blood circulation, as well as muscle relaxation. jjimjilbangs to hit up for the best scrub dragon hill spa, 40-713 hangangro 3-ga yongsan-gu, seoul; +82 2 797 0002; open 24 hours; ₩11,000-₩13,000 ($10-$12)for admission, scrub prices vary the spa in garden 5, 5/f 10, tool da-dong garden5, 292 munjeong-dong songpa-gu, seoul; +82 2 404 2700; open 24 hours; ₩6,000-₩8,000 ($5-7)for admission, scrub prices vary spa land, centum city, 35 centumnam-daero, haeundae-gu, busan; +82 51 745 2900; open daily, 6 a.m.-midnight, admission: ₩12,000 ($11) on weekdays and ₩14,000 ($12) on weekends; scrub starts at ₩20,000 ($18)","getting scrubbed at a korean jjimjilbang is a therapeutic, if painful, process"

"human rights lawyers filed a class action law suit in a u.s federal court accusing the united nations of gross negligence and misconduct on behalf of victims of a cholera outbreak in haiti in 2010. ""the claims are that the u.n. engaged in reckless and gross negligence and misconduct bringing cholera to haiti,"" said ira kurzban, a lawyer and board member with the boston-based institute for justice and development in haiti. the group is demanding financial compensation for the 8,300 haitians who died as a result of the cholera epidemic as well as some 650,000 more survivors of the illness. how women are lifting up haiti u.n. spokesman farhan haq expressed to cnn ""it is not the united nations' practice to discuss in public claims filed against the organization."" earlier this year, however, secretary-general ban ki-moon declared the united nations could not receive claims for compensation from haitian cholera victims, arguing that the organization had legal immunity according to an international convention. in october 2010, a cholera epidemic exploded in haiti, striking as the island country was still reeling from a deadly earthquake earlier that year which killed tens of thousands of people. the cholera bacteria, which is not indigenous to haiti, spread rapidly, ultimately killing an estimated 8,300 people. the epidemic sparked riots in several cities and towns against the force of some 8,000 u.n. peacekeepers deployed there. haiti transitions from relief to rebuilding several scientific and medical investigators eventually concluded that one of the likely sources of the outbreak was sewage leaking from a u.n. base housing nepalese peacekeepers. the base was perched above a tributary stream leading into the artibonite river near the town of meille. ""the way we understand disease transmission today, there is no other good explanation for how a (cholera) strain that was present only in the northeastern region of the indian subcontinent traveled 9,000 miles to haiti and happened to end up in a river next to a base with u.n. peacekeepers from nepal, said jonathan katz, a former associated press reporter who was one of the first journalists to investigate the source of outbreak in 2010. katz, who further investigated the u.n.'s response to the outbreak in his book ""the big truck that went by: how the world came to save haiti and left behind a disaster,"" accused the united nations of covering up its responsibility for the cholera epidemic. ""in 2010, the u.n. didn't want anyone to talk about this,"" katz said, in a phone interview with cnn. ""they were directly castigating anyone who would bring up the topic."" in september, the prime minister of haiti raised the issue during a speech before the u.n. general assembly. ""the united nations has a moral responsibility for the eruption of the epidemic,"" said prime minister laurent lamothe, according to a u.n. transcript. lamothe argued that the current efforts made by the u.n. to eradicate cholera were far from sufficient. he called for the creation of a joint commission to further study the disease. in a briefing to journalists on wednesday, u.n. spokesman farhan haq said as a result of the haitian epidemic, the organization was in the process of adopting steps to prevent the further spread of the disease. ""part of our lessons learned from this has been to screen peacekeepers for cholera,"" haq said. health authorities continue to document thousands of cholera cases a month. at least 182 haitians died of cholera between april and august 2013, according to the world health organization. in 2011: haiti cholera victims demand u.n. compensation",lawsuit in u.s federal court accuses u.n. of gross negligence and misconduct

"-- it's been nine years since kim and curtis christiansen were married. since then they've had their ups and downs, but they've remained close. but when curtis began snoring about three years ago, kim began sleeping on the couch. after his snoring drove his wife, kim, to sleep on the couch, curtis christiansen saw a sleep specialist. ""his snoring was so loud. at first i would just elbow him to wake him up,"" she said, ""but then i became concerned. he would just (she gasps for breath). it would take his breath away."" at first curtis christiansen figured he was tired, a little run down from his job. he thought the snoring was just a symptom of his exhaustion. but when he started nodding off while waiting at a traffic light, he knew something was wrong. ""i became more aware of this choking and waking-up feeling,"" he said. kim christiansen finally persuaded her husband to go to a sleep specialist. the diagnosis: obstructive sleep apnea. according to the national sleep foundation, more than 18 million american adults have sleep apnea, and many of them don't know it. some people think their snoring is just a side effect of a busy lifestyle. watch more on the difference between sleep apnea and snoring » in some cases, that's true. but the foundation says it's trying to get more people to realize how important it is to know the difference between occasional snoring and apnea. studies have shown that sleep apnea has some serious side effects. a disorder in which breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted during sleep, apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open, despite efforts to breathe. that can cause broken sleep patterns and low blood oxygen levels. doctors say these side effects can lead to hypertension, heart disease, and mood and memory problems. in a recent study at the university of maryland medical center, researchers found that sleep apnea can cause a rise in depression and that sleep-related breathing disorders can also worsen nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder. and because sufferers are usually sleepy during the day, apnea can increase the risk of automobile crashes. there's no question it can be life-threatening, doctors say. so how do you know whether your snoring is something more serious? when snoring starts to affect your daily habits, you should see a doctor, said dr. thomas lorusso, director of the northern virginia sleep diagnostic centers. ""a bed partner may notice that the patient stops breathing and snores loudly, "" lorusso said. ""and the daytime symptoms are sleepiness, poor concentration, problems waking up in the morning."" lorusso says a good way to check your sleep habits is to note your levels of fatigue during the day and jot down other symptoms you might be having. and if you have a bed partner, ask whether he or she has noticed any ""choking or gasping while you snore,"" he said. ""the person you sleep with, many times, knows your snoring better than you."" specific lifestyle changes can help you avoid sleep apnea, the sleep foundation said. lorusso agrees. ""cut out the alcohol,"" he said. ""it can make the upper airway muscles to relax."" and watch your weight. losing pounds can ""cure"" sleep apnea, especially for overweight people, lorusso said. if you smoke, try to quit, he said. smoking creates swelling in the upper airway, making apnea worse. these seemingly small changes can have dramatic results. ""in some cases, changing these factors can eliminate sleep apnea from some patients,"" lorusso said. for curtis christiansen, it wasn't that easy. not only was he thin and a non-smoker, he suffered from high blood pressure and high cholesterol and, because of a previous health issue, had only one kidney. he needed help immediately. his doctor recommended a device called a cpap, or continuous positive airway pressure device. it's a mask or nose piece that blows air into the airway to keep it open while a patient sleeps. although surgery is an option for those who have problems even with the cpap, christiansen wasn't one of them. since his diagnosis, christiansen has gotten his blood pressure under control. when he started wearing the cpap, he confesses, he'd leave it behind when he went out of town. ""but i found i wasn't getting a good night's sleep, so now i take the cpap along,"" he said with a smile, ""and i have a restful vacation with my wife.""","in sleep apnea, breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted"
"-- when congress is tasked with debating u.s. involvement in overseas conflicts, a common refrain from lawmakers is to follow the advice of military commanders. it has been repeated dozens of times, for instance, by sen. john mccain, r-arizona, when discussing the wars in iraq and afghanistan. ""we urge the administration to work urgently with iraqi authorities to reach an agreement that reflects the best military advice of u.s. commanders on the ground,"" he wrote in a news release in 2011 about reducing the u.s. military footprint in iraq. he said something similar in a 2012 statement about afghanistan. now that congress will have its say on u.s. intervention in syria, it has testimony and documents from top members of the military to reference, and some of the testimony falls short of an enthusiastic endorsement of u.s. involvement. concerns exist within the ranks of the military over the outcome of such strikes, and those concerns are coupled with worries about strains on an already stretched military. dempsey: intervention in syria could cost billions a frank assessment of the risks in a series of communications with congress over the summer, gen. martin dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, testified and wrote letters to congress about the risk of u.s. military involvement in syria. chief among them is the challenge that a limited strike remain limited in scope. in an assessment to sen. carl levin, head of the senate armed services committee, on july 19, dempsey outlined possible scenarios and the risks they bring. dempsey said u.s. involvement, even if it's limited in nature, would probably lead to an extended stay. ""once we take action, we should be prepared for what comes next. deeper involvement is hard to avoid,"" he wrote. dempsey explains that risks include retaliatory attacks by the al-assad regime, civilian casualties and ""extremists"" -- including al qaeda, hezbollah and iran -- gaining more control and access to weapons, including chemical weapons. two days before the alleged chemical attacks in syria, dempsey replied to a request from new york rep. eliot engel on dempsey's assessment of different military options in syria. the general outlined a difficult path for u.s. success in syria. ""in a variety of ways, the use of u.s. military force can change the military balance, but it cannot resolve the underlying and historic ethnic, religious and tribal issues that are fueling this conflict,"" dempsey wrote. ""it is my belief that the side we chose must be ready to support their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. today, they are not."" another high-ranking member of the military urged extreme caution. according to the washington post, gen. james mattis, former head of u.s. central command, said at a security conference in july that ""this is going to be a full-throated, very, very serious war"" if the u.s. becomes involved. house armed services committee chairman buck mckeon said he has concerns about the ongoing strategy after an attack. ""i'm concerned about more the military aspects, what are we expecting syria, iran, hezbollah, their other allies in the region to do. what are we doing about any attacks that might happen to israel or jordan or turkey, other areas in the region,"" said mckeon, r-california.

""we're in a position right now where we don't have the assets to get involved in another intervention,"" he said on cnn's ""the lead"" last week. mckeon had similar concerns about the forced spending cuts. ""that is the thing that really concerns me is, sequestration on the backs of our military is making it very difficult for them to carry out mission after mission,"" mckeon said. congressional hawks tie syria to budget cuts in addition to budget cuts, the wars in iraq and afghanistan have strained the military but also taught military leaders valuable lessons. dempsey wrote: ""we have learned from the past 10 years; however, that it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to preserve a functioning state. ... should the regime's institutions collapse in the absence of a viable opposition, we could inadvertently empower extremists or unleash the very chemical weapons we seek to control."" rep. john garamendi, d-california, echoed dempsey's sentiment. ""the past decade has amply demonstrated the folly of military commitments poorly conceived,"" he wrote in a statement. secretary of state john kerry dismissed that argument. ""fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility,"" he said friday. despite concerns, support exists however, some former top military leaders are coming out in support of a military strike. gen. wesley clark, the former supreme commander of nato who led military forces in the kosovo war in 1999, laid out a grim assessment. ""at a time when the u.s. faces many other security threats, not to mention economic and political challenges at home, it is tempting to view action against syria's regime as a significant distraction. certainly, it also carries risks. ... you can't always control the script after you decide to launch a limited, measured attack,"" he wrote in an opinion piece friday in usa today. despite his measured tone, he said the humanitarian crisis is the u.s.'s responsibility. ""president obama has rightly drawn a line at the use of chemical weapons. some weapons are simply too inhuman to be used. and, as many of us learned during 1990s, in the words of president clinton, 'where we can make a difference, we must act.'

"(cnn)a video shoot in nepal for an internet comedy series took a serious turn on saturday as the earth began rumbling. the nepali pranksters were in the middle of shooting an episode for their hidden camera series when the magnitude-7.8 earthquake broke out. the team kept the camera rolling as they moved through the crowded streets, surveying destruction to homes and historic sites and capturing scenes of heroism and chaos. the nepali pranksters' videos show people's reactions to various ""pranks"" that challenge cultural norms. one video shows the pranksters walking up to strangers and taking their hands for a long, awkward, handshake; another shows them complimenting men and women on their clothes and appearance, with mixed results. for their next prank based on nepal's ban on plastic bags, ashish prasai and akash sedai were in jawalakhel, sedai said in an email to cnn. the town, in lalitpur district, is home to nepal's famed central zoo. the camera was rolling when they felt the ground shaking around 11:55 a.m., sedai said. people started screaming and crying and vehicles came to a standstill as a building collapsed in the background. but earthquakes are a fact of life in nepal, and ""we were still thinking it was a just a simple earthquake,"" sedai said. they kept the camera rolling for 18 minutes as they traversed the streets full of crying and shouting people. they found homes destroyed, where people were pulling survivors out from piles of rubble. they stopped and talked to motorists, urging them to keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles, sedai said. they continued filming as they made their way to to the historic dharahara tower and basantapur durbar square, a unesco world heritage site, where people crawled among the ruins. by then, they realized their country was in a ""very bad condition,"" sedai said. the nepali pranksters made it through the first day of the earthquake, as did their families, sedai said. but with aftershocks and crumbling infrastructure still posing threats, safety is a temporary state of mind right now in nepal. ""we are scared. ... earthquakes waves are occurring now,"" he said.

"-- at just 7 years old, kyron chase is facing the unimaginable: his father was murdered. ""telling my son his father had been killed was one of the hardest things i've ever had to do,"" said kimberly vinson, kyron's mother. ""their bond, it was just a bond that a lot of kids don't have with their father."" kyron has struggled to cope after his father's death in december. and vinson, left to raise two small children on her own, has struggled to fill the void for her son. ""my concern is how he will make it through this,"" she said. last year, baltimore's homicide rate hit a four-year high. yet families such as vinson's have few resources to help them heal from the trauma of a relative's sudden death. that's where annette march-grier steps in. her nonprofit in baltimore helps children and their families cope with grief. ""a child's grief over the loss of a loved one is often complicated by the loss of security and identity,"" said march-grier, a bereavement counselor and registered nurse. ""this shift can be very dangerous if there's no support system there."" ""our program provides that safe place for a child to recover."" since 2008, her organization, roberta's house, has provided free grief support programs to more than 2,100 people -- nearly half of them children. when death strikes a childhood march-grier's vision for roberta's house stemmed from her childhood. she grew up in her family's funeral home. ""as a little girl, i would sit at the top of the stairs and peer down between the banister rails, watching as families gathered around their deceased loved ones,"" said march-grier, 53. ""death was all around me."" through the years, she met thousands of grieving families -- especially children -- struggling to cope with their loss. ""i love my city. ... but people here are having crisis after crisis,"" she said. ""the violence in this city and grief are directly connected."" today, roberta's house -- named for march-grier's late mother -- offers peer support groups, counseling and specialized workshops to anyone in the community. the family program is tailored to children 5 to 17. volunteers help them explore their feelings and learn healthy ways of coping through journaling, games and arts and crafts. the group also offers a three-day summer camp. ""we teach our children it's ok to cry, (that) crying is really an indication of love, not an expression of weakness,"" march-grier said. kyron and his mom have been attending sessions at roberta's house for a month. vinson says her son is opening up more about his feelings and his dad. ""i (wanted) to let him know that there are other (children) that are going through the same thing he's going through,"" she said. changing the game since 2011, march-grier says she has also been helping juvenile offenders cope with different types of loss, such as the incarceration of a parent or sexual abuse. the teenagers go through a six-month program aimed to help them get on the right track. to that end, march-grier uses a ""scared straight"" tactic: she stages a funeral for the teens and tells them to imagine it's theirs. ""we take them to the funeral home and help them see that if you're going to play the game, you have to realize there is an end to this game,"" she said. ""this is our way of trying to reach them before it's too late."" march-grier believes grief is a public health problem. she often takes her message out into the community, providing free workshops to children and adults at local schools, churches, hospices and community centers. ""unresolved grief can cause people to go through life severely wounded,"" she said. ""our goal is to help people understand that grief does not have to destroy them."" with plans to expand her services and move to a larger location, march-grier wants to continue her parent's legacy in baltimore.

"bucharest, romania (reuters) -- in the mobile phone version of the ""harry potter and the order of the phoenix"" video game, the torches hanging along the dark walls of hogwarts glow in an eerily realistic fashion. romania is known for its strong computing and language skills coupled with cheap labor. ""we invented the technology, it's called 'dynamic lighting',"" said mihai pohontu, general manager of romania's mobile phone branch of electronic arts inc, the world's biggest video game publisher. romanian programmers, such as pohontu's team, are among the most sought-after in the world as large international it companies turn to the east european country to take advantage of strong computing and language skills coupled with cheap labor. its computer literacy is not without its dark side -- the country has an unenviable reputation as a hotbed for computer fraud and a large community of hackers. but legitimate it is one of romania's fastest growing export sectors with turnover of about 1 billion euros ($1.38 billion). roughly 90 percent of some 1,000 it companies in romania are foreign-owned and the government hopes exports will reach 1 billion euros in the next couple of years. in february, bill gates opened a microsoft corp. technical support center in bucharest. the investment followed, among others, the launch of a development center by amazon.com inc in the university town of iasi in 2005. that is the online retailer's only software development hub in europe besides one in scotland's edinburgh. other centers are located in india, the united states and south africa. ""romanian programmers are exceptionally creative. and in games, you need to explore,"" said pohontu. prospects for large cash inflows from the european union after romania joined the bloc this january, cut-rate taxes and low wages add to romania's appeal. ""in eastern europe, romania is appreciated as having the biggest growth potential together with turkey and russia,"" said stefan cojanu, head of oracle corp in romania. the software maker, which has a support and software development center in romania, has doubled its local staff to 1,000 over the last year since opening a tower office in central bucharest. it plans to hire an additional 500 employees. ""the geographical distance, the similar time zone and business mentality argue for us to develop our activities in a country where costs are also lower,"" cojanu said. romania's low wages of around $600 a month compare with $1,050 in poland and $950 in the czech republic. both countries also attract hefty investment in the it sector. however, some see a risk the sector is overheating. double-digit wage growth and a shortage of skilled labor is dampening the enthusiasm of some investors and romania is struggling with emigration as workers leave for better pay. ""the battle for specialists is very intense,"" said ana ber, head of human resources firm dr.pendl & dr.piswanger. ""there aren't enough of them, especially as many emigrated."" industry observers say this state of affairs has prompted companies to focus on building support or software development centers, which need cheaper and lower skilled labor, rather than hiring high-end programmers. ""romania remains good for outsourcing but not for first-class software authors,"" said dragos stanescu, sales and marketing manager at gecad, a romanian company that sold rav antivirus technology to microsoft in 2003. ""the brains are already with companies that have good salaries and it is costly to buy them. a good senior programmer can earn 2,000 euros gross a month. plus a 30 percent raise to buy him, and you have a salary of a good programmer in germany."" fbi data show romania may be the biggest single source of online auction fraud in the world, a multi-million dollar industry that scams people using web sites like ebay. ""it's highly organized. they create fake accounts to trick people into thinking they are insured,"" said gary dickson, fbi representative in romania. ""if romanians were stopped, the amount of online fraud would drop significantly."" experts say some 70 percent of software used in romania is pirated, and salesmen still visit office buildings in central bucharest to sell pirated cds and dvds. some hackers hope their skills will help secure employment, although breaking into other people's networks for fame or as part of a job cv has its dangers.

"-- japan's nuclear watchdog on wednesday said a toxic water leak at the tsunami-damaged fukushima daiichi power plant has been classified as a level 3 ""serious incident"" on an international scale. the nuclear regulation authority (nra) said it had made the decision after consulting with the vienna-based international atomic energy agency, said juntaro yamada, a spokesman for the regulator. as news emerged last week of the leak of hundreds of tons of radioactive water from a storage tank, the nra said it was planning to issue the alert, its gravest warning since the massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that sent three reactors at the plant into meltdown. the leak had previously been assigned a level 1 ""anomaly rating"" on the international nuclear and radiological event scale, which ranges from zero, for no safety threat, to seven, for a major accident like the meltdowns. the decision to issue the level 3 alert came two days after a japanese government minister had compared the plant operator's efforts to deal with worrying toxic water leaks at the site to a game of ""whack-a-mole."" toshimitsu motegi, the industry minister, said monday after visiting the plant that ""from now on, the government is going to step forward."" his ministry has been tasked by prime minister shinzo abe to come up with measures to tackle the mounting problems at fukushima daiichi. tepco looks for outside help to stabilize fukushima huge volumes of toxic water the plant operator, tokyo electric power company (tepco), has been struggling to deal with the high volume of contaminated water at the plant. last month, tepco admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the pacific ocean from the site, bypassing an underground barrier built to seal in the water. about 400 tons of groundwater flow into the site each day, and tepco also pumps large amounts water through the buildings to keep the crippled reactors cool. fukishima tuna study finds miniscule health risks the operator has stored hundreds of thousands of tons of the contaminated water in huge tanks at the site. there are now about 1,000 of the containers, 93% of which are already full of radioactive water. around 350 of the tanks were built as temporary storage units in the aftermath of the meltdowns. but more than two years later, they are still being used. it was one of those makeshift tanks where the leak was detected, setting off the latest crisis. tepco says it has transferred the remaining tainted water from the faulty tank to another container. but it hasn't said what caused the leak in the first place. japan ponders freezing ground cnn's junko ogura reported from tokyo, and jethro mullen wrote from hong kong.",the alert is japan's gravest warning since meltdowns at the nuclear plant in 2011

"(ew.com) -- next week's episode of parks and recreation is going to have a vip: the vp. joe biden — yes, the very guy who was re-elected vice president of the united states — will guest-star in the nov. 15 installment of parks and recreation, ew has learned. his cameo occurs at the beginning of the episode, in which former congressional campaign manager ben wyatt (adam scott) takes fiancée/city councilwoman leslie knope (amy poehler), to the white house to meet america's no. 2, who has long been her no. 1 crush. (as leslie once noted, her ideal man has ""the brains of george clooney and the body of joe biden."") parks scored camera time with biden in july when the show traveled to washington, d.c. to film its season 5 premiere, which featured appearances by senators barbara boxer, olympia snowe, and john mccain. how big of a casting coup was biden for nbc's small-town government comedy? ""given that eleanor roosevelt and bella abzug are no longer with us, this is probably no. 1,"" quips executive producer michael schur. ""[leslie] has a lot of female heroes that cross party lines. she has a lot of social figures that she considers heroes, but the funniest hero is joe biden. there's an episode last season where she says, 'joe biden is on my celebrity sex list — well, he is my celebrity sex list'... it was amazing to have her meet olympia snowe and barbara boxer because that meant something to her politically. but this transcends that. she's meeting the man that she's in love with on some deep level. it was a bigger deal to us in some ways that she meet joe biden than it was that she meet barack obama."" (obama, by the way, has revealed that he watches parks with his family, by the way. ""it's a very amazing and weird thing to find out that the president watches your show,"" marvels schur.) once the producers committed to shooting an episode in d.c., the process of landing biden was ""so much less difficult than we ever possibly imagined,"" says schur, noting: ""his staff really loves the show, and he apparently had watched the show with his family and his family liked it... the hardest part was keeping it secret for so long because there's all these fec rules and equal-time rules. we couldn't air it before the election because it was the equivalent of a campaign contribution to advertise for one candidate."" the biden-knope summit, a surprise ""engagement present"" from ben, lasts less than a minute and was written in a manner that would work regardless of the election's outcome. ""we did not in any way want the moment to be a political issue — we treated it in the writing and the execution like our main character was meeting her hero,"" says schur. (he notes that the writers did pen an addendum to the scene in the event of an obama-biden loss or a ""weird florida disaster tie."") the meeting takes place in the vice president's ceremonial office in the white house-adjacent eisenhower executive office building, with biden flanked by his real-life staff. ""they have a conversation where she does what you would imagine leslie knope would do when meeting joe biden, which is she loses control of herself a little bit,"" hints schur. ""she gets really giggly and goofy around him."" when the parks crew set up in his office to shoot the scene, biden happened to be tied up in a meeting with... president barack obama. then ""obama got on marine one and flew away, and biden walked across the executive building and we shot the scene,"" says schur. ""it was really cool: you go this way and get on a helicopter that will take you to some incredibly important thing, and you come this way and shoot a scene with amy poehler."" the veep handled his scene like a pro, even ad-libbing a response to a crazy leslie retort that wound up in the final cut of the episode. ""he was very nice and charming,"" reports schur. ""he was clearly a big fan of amy. it was the day the emmy nominations came out and when he walked through the door he congratulated her on her emmy nomination... he said some very nice things about the show and talked about how the pro-public service message was meaningful."" while schur & co. were thrilled to venture onto hallowed washington ground, they aren't plotting the next great political cameo right now: ""since the beginning of the show, joe biden has been the no. 1 guy, so in terms of her achievements or personal milestones we'll have to go in a different direction,"" he says.

"(cnn) -- the woman who made the 911 call that led to the arrest of harvard professor henry louis gates jr. never referred to black suspects when she called authorities for what she thought was a potential break-in. harvard university professor henry louis gates jr. was arrested after a break-in was reported to police. police in cambridge, massachusetts, released the 911 phone call monday. in the call, lucia whalen reports seeing ""two larger men, one looked kind of hispanic, but i'm not really sure, and the other one entered, and i didn't see what he looked like at all."" ""i just saw it from a distance, and this older woman was worried, thinking somebody's breaking in someone's house and they've been barging in,"" whalen says. ""she interrupted me, and that's when i noticed. otherwise, i probably wouldn't have noticed it at all, to be honest with you. so i was just calling because she was a concerned neighbor, i guess."" listen to the entire 911 call » attorney wendy murphy, who represents whalen, also categorically rejected part of the police report that said whalen talked with sgt. james crowley, the arresting officer, at the scene. ""let me be clear: she never had a conversation with sgt. crowley at the scene,"" murphy told cnn by phone. ""and she never said to any police officer or to anybody 'two black men.' she never used the word 'black.' period."" she added, ""i'm not sure what the police explanation will be. frankly, i don't care. her only goal is to make it clear she never described them as black. she never saw their race. ... all she reported was behavior, not skin color."" calls to the cambridge police department about the issue have not been returned. police commissioner robert haas told reporters at a news conference monday that the 911 tape and police transmission from that day ""speak for themselves, and i would ask that you form your own opinion."" he added that police always ask themselves: ""if i had to do it over again, what would i have done differently?"" ""this matter is not resolved,"" haas said. ""we have a long way to go. we recognize that we are going to take advantage of the situation and we're going to learn from it. we're going to move forward."" in the police report, filed by crowley, he says he spoke with whalen outside the home before he approached gates' house. ""she went on to tell me that she observed what appeared to be two black males with backpacks on the porch of ware street,"" the report says. ""she told me that her suspicions were aroused when she observed one of the men wedging his shoulder into the door as if he was trying to force entry."" murphy also disputed accounts of her client as a white woman in the traditional sense. ""the fact is, she's olive-skinned and of portuguese descent. you wouldn't look at her and say, necessarily, 'oh, there's a white woman.' you might think she was hispanic,"" murphy said. murphy's comments add yet another layer of intrigue to the july 16 arrest that has prompted heated discussion across the nation on race relations in america, including president obama weighing in on the issue. obama last week first said police ""acted stupidly"" in arresting gates after he presented identification that showed he lived in the home. but by friday, the president said that he had spoken with crowley and that he didn't mean to malign the police department. the president acknowledged that his words ""helped to contribute to ratcheting"" up the debate and controversy surrounding the arrest. ""i could have calibrated those words differently, and i told this to sgt. crowley,"" obama said. obama spoke about two hours after police unions in massachusetts called on him to apologize. obama has invited crowley and gates to the white house this week for beer. meanwhile, authorities in cambridge announced they have created a panel to advise police on racial issues as a result of gates' arrest. ""i am committed to making sure our city is not defined by that day. today is the day to move forward,"" city manager robert healy told reporters at monday's news conference. watch ""lessons learned"" panel formed » the committee, led by ""nationally recognized experts,"" will not investigate the arrest of gates -- one of the nation's most prolific scholars on african-american affairs -- nor will it ""make any judgments"" on the officers involved, healy said. the committee ""will identify lessons to be taken from the circumstances surrounding the incident"" and will advise the police department on how ""those lessons can be applied"" to its policies and practices. ""it's time to move forward and look at lessons learned and go from there,"" healy said. he also weighed in on the upcoming meeting in washington between gates, crowley and obama: ""i hope they enjoy their beer at the white house."" the meeting will take place on thursday, said a senior administration official. also at the news conference, cambridge mayor denise simmons, who is african-american, said the arrest was a ""turning point for the city."" ""while this has been a trying time for cambridge, we are confident that we can ultimately come out stronger and more unified,"" she said. ""we see ourselves as america's classroom."" speaking to cnn by phone, murphy said she was trying to clear whalen's name after she's come under attack by bloggers and in chat rooms, accused of racial profiling when she first called police. she said whalen is ""devastated"" by such characterizations because she is sensitive about such issues because of her own complexion. whalen worked down the street and was on her lunch break when she called police. ""she just wants to clear her name. she doesn't want to create more controversy,"" murphy said.

""the president-elect and i understand and are deeply sympathetic to israel's desire to defend itself under the current conditions and to be free of shelling by hamas rockets,"" she noted. ""however, we have also been reminded of the tragic humanitarian costs of conflict in the middle east and pained by the suffering of palestinian and israeli civilians."" clinton stated that the recent violence in gaza ""must only increase our determination to seek a just and lasting peace agreement that brings real security to israel, normal and positive relations with its neighbors, and independence, economic progress and security to the palestinians in their own state."" later, as the committee adjourned for an early afternoon break, six code pink protesters screamed, ""what about gaza? we need your voice, hillary."" the protesters held up pink signs that said ""ceasefire in gaza."" the biggest danger to u.s. security, clinton emphasized, is that weapons of mass destruction will fall into the hands of terrorists. for that reason, she asserted, she favors a ""tough, reality-based approach to north korea"" as the best way to minimize or eliminate the regime's role as a proliferator of deadly weapons and nuclear technology. while clinton supports the six-party talks as ""a vehicle for us to exert pressure on north korea in a way that is more likely to alter their behavior,"" she also said that she is under ""no illusions"" about the scope of the challenge presented by the rogue regime. she indicated that the entire ""record of negotiation [with north korea] up to this date"" is under review. clinton also stated, however, that the talks aimed at ending north korea's nuclear program provided a unique opportunity for bilateral contact between the united states and a regime once labeled by president bush as part of the ""axis of evil."" responding to a question from california sen. barbara boxer about the trafficking and imprisonment of sex slaves, clinton said she views issues relating to women's rights as ""central"" to american foreign policy. ""we cannot have a free, prosperous [and] progressive world if women are treated in a ... discriminatory, violent way,"" clinton argued. she pledged to do everything possible to eliminate ""a slavery of girls and women"" that exists in forms ranging from a disparity in wages to captivity in brothels. as the hearing opened, committee chairman sen. john kerry, d-massachusetts, called clinton an ""alliance builder"" who has ""earned the respect of her colleagues"" and could help overcome ""the polarization of the last eight years."" confirming her as the next secretary of state, he said, would send the international community a ""strong signal immediately that america is back."" indiana sen. richard lugar, the committee's ranking republican, said that obama, by tapping clinton, had chosen ""the epitome of a big leaguer"" who could ""bolster efforts to improve foreign attitudes towards the united states."" asked how clinton had performed at the morning hearing, lugar responded: ""she did well."" but both kerry and lugar noted the need for clinton to address questions relating to the fundraising activities of her husband, former president bill clinton. confirmation hearings for education secretary nominee arne duncan, housing and urban development secretary nominee shaun donovan, and energy secretary nominee steven chu were also held on tuesday.","hillary clinton says protecting u.s. interests would be her ""overriding duty"""

"-- japan is getting bigger and bigger and bigger -- one volcanic blast at a time. the growth so far -- compared to the size of the asian nation's main honshu island or the vast continent of asia -- is minuscule, about 200 meters (650 feet) long by about 50 meters wide. that's small enough that, if the volcanic activity stops, the newly created island could wash back into the sea in months. but if it keeps going, it could enlarge even more and stick around for the long haul, expanding japan's footprint in the process. ""a lot of it depends on how fast it erodes,"" said ken rubin, a university of hawaii at manoa professor and expert in deep submarine volcanism. ""until it shuts off, it's too soon to tell."" even it slips away, and even if such volcanoes poke up from the sea floor like this every few years, what's happened so far is exciting for volcanologists. and video of the steady eruption -- a stream of white smoke, interrupted by occasional blasts of blackish material -- is powerful imagery of what's unfolding, even if what's emitted doesn't spew anywhere as high into the sky as land-based volcanoes like el chichon or mount pinatubo. unlike these deadly examples, this pacific volcano started its eruption -- on wednesday, according to the japan meteorological agency, at the least -- in shallows off the small, remote island of nishinoshima, hundreds of miles over sea due south of tokyo. the national agency since issued a warning for those around the island crater. the most common type of volcano, by far, are those that erupt and spew material underwater: rubin estimates ""probably more than 80% happen in the oceans, and we never know about them."" volcanoes that erupt on land get the most attention, for good reason, given their impact on people, vegetation and (by virtue of their expansive eruptions into the atmosphere) on things like air traffic patterns and climate. what's happening near these isolated japanese islands is more of a sea-land hybrid. it is rooted on the flank of a string of underwater volcanoes a few hundred feet from the main island, rubin explained. what's being expelled into the air -- a mixture of water that appears as whitish, fluffy steam and darker coarse rock fragments -- is distinct from the magma, he adds.

"-- jeremy lin has taken the basketball world by storm, but boxing star floyd mayweather jr. claims the hype surrounding the nba's new sensation is based on his ethnic background rather than his talent. lin has had a fairytale rise to fame after inspiring the new york knicks to a five-game winning streak and scoring a record 109 points in his first four starts for the team -- surpassing the mark previously set by allen iverson. but undefeated wbc welterweight champion mayweather has suggested the ""linsanity"" sweeping america is because pointguard lin is the first u.s.-born nba player of chinese or taiwanese descent.

"-- while others will sharply disagree, i believe john brennan deserves a national salute for his press conference yesterday about the cia. at a time when we are tearing ourselves apart over one controversy after another, he provided a model of a calm, adult leader trying to put the country first. no doubt there will be counterattacks trying to blow holes in his story. maybe there are some. but we sorely needed someone to come forth with views that are more balanced and impartial than a tragically one-sided report released this week by the senate intelligence committee. there were half a dozen aspects of the brennan press conference that were welcome: for starters, he placed the interrogation program into a context that too many are forgetting. as brennan pointed out, the attacks that morning of 9/11 terrified the country and we quickly looked to the cia to track down those responsible and ensure they never attacked us again. we didn't want those agents -- as the phrase goes -- to bring a baguette to a knife fight; both the white house and congress wanted them to do whatever it took. brennan also made clear that the cia (he served as deputy director under president george w. bush) was not prepared to run a detention and interrogation program -- who would have thought they needed one? they put it together quickly, but -- as brennan readily conceded -- some agents then went far beyond the rules, employing brutal interrogation techniques. he should also have conceded that was torture. what has been missing in much of the hyperventilation over the senate report is that the number of people water boarded was actually tiny: three says brennan, though the senate committee insists the number is slightly higher. with numbers that small, it is far more believable that most agents -- as brennan said -- acted within the rules. is this any basis for treating the cia like a brutal, rogue operation? in law school, one of the first lessons learned is how important distinctions are. brennan made a crucial one: the difference between causation and correlation. the agency, he says, gained valuable intelligence -- such as leads on bin laden -- from prisoners who had undergone enhanced interrogation techniques (""eits"" in the trade). but it is unclear whether they might have given that same information had they not been treated to eits. the latter, he kept insisting, is ""unknowable."" in other words, he does not think that harsh techniques necessarily caused detainees to open up. yet it is also clear from his version of events that interrogators saw a correlation: valuable leads could often come after harsh techniques. this correlation makes it easier to understand why bush officials would want to continue the eits, and why so many cia directors and deputy directors defend the program. this is a distinction that is thus very, very important. to be fair, committee chair dianne feinstein insists that much of the information given up by detainees was obtained before they were subjected to eits. this disagreement between her and brennan is one of several that need further scrutiny. but brennan's version of events lends credence to the notion that neither the agency nor the bush administration was acting as criminally as their critics charge. on one side, we now have a stinging indictment of the cia drawn up by committee staff members all hired by democrats. only democratic members of the committee approved their report. their report was drawn up based upon millions of documents, but not a single interview with cia agents. on the other side, we have a well-laid out defense coming from john brennan, who worked in the white house under bill clinton and was so trusted by another democrat, barack obama, that he was appointed to run one of the most sensitive organizations in government, the cia. this same man admits that the cia made many mistakes, that the interrogation program was deeply flawed, and that it was properly stopped -- but he insists that overall, cia agents deserve respect for bravely putting their lives on the line for the country -- some 20 have died -- and very importantly, for helping to prevent a new 9/11. given this background, isn't john brennan at least as credible as the committee, if not more so? aren't his views more balanced -- and thus deserving of respect? shouldn't his views help us to moderate the red hot coverage in the press and the monotonous partisan attacks among politicians? i think so. one more thing: brennan asked us to keep things in perspective. we need to do that -- to remember what makes us americans. no other country to my knowledge has been so transparent about its paramilitary techniques in the midst of a dangerous war. indeed, we all know what the terrorists would have done had they captured a bunch of americans: they would have butchered every last one. good for john brennan, he's helping us think clearly again.",david gergen: cia chief is talking sense about the cia interrogation program
"-- u.s. president obama sent a direct message to iran's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei weeks before this month's disputed election, iranian sources said wednesday. iran's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, calls for an end to protests last week at tehran university. the letter requested dialogue and engagement between the two nations, the sources said. the sources said that khamenei has yet to reply to the letter but that nonetheless it ""had set the negotiating table in order for both sides to sit around it after the election."" the white house refused to ""get into the specifics of our different ways of communicating,"" a senior obama administration official said. ""we have indicated a willingness to talk for a long time and have sought to communicate with the iranians in a variety of ways,"" the official said. khamenei made an indirect reference to the letter in his sermon on friday at tehran university. ""the u.s. president said that we were waiting for a day like this to see people on the street,"" the iranian leader said. ""some people attributed these remarks to obama, and then they write letters to say we're ready to have ties, that we respect the islamic republic, and on the other hand, they make such comments. which one should we believe?"" one iranian source said, ""we thought president obama would send congratulations to president ahmadinejad,"" and before the election, his senior advisers prepared a response to the anticipated note, which never came. the iranian source said the election dispute is wasting time on the issue of starting u.s.-iranian negotiations. watch how the reported letter is part of a new policy of engagement » ""the longer it is delayed,"" the source said, ""the less likely [u.s.-iranian talks] will happen."" another iranian government official said there is still ""no trust"" between iran and the united states. the source said he is waiting for ""real change"" even though the iranian government welcomed the change in tone of the obama administration before the current election turmoil in iran. the official went on to cite a recent gesture by iran toward obama: the release of journalist roxana saberi. the official said iran accepted obama's assurances that she was not a spy and had allowed the iranian citizen to leave the country. since, under intense scrutiny amid growing concerns over tehran's violent crackdown on street protests, obama has sharpened his language on iran. ""the united states and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days,"" obama said tuesday, adding that he strongly condemns ""these unjust actions."" he has not spoken in support of ahmadinejad or his main rival, mir hossein moussavi, whose supporters have taken to the streets to protest the results of the june 12 election that gave ahmadinejad a second term. obama's letter to khamenei is in keeping with his publicly stated aim of engagement with iran and his new year's message in which he described a new way forward. the obama administration has ""made it clear that any real dialogue -- multilateral or bilateral -- needed to be authoritative,"" according to the senior administration official. the official noted that the iranians have yet to respond to a diplomatic outreach made during talks on iran's nuclear program april 8. at that time, the administration asked the european union's international policy chief, javier solana, to invite iran to new talks with the permanent members of the u.n. security council and germany. but the administration's tack toward iran may be changing, as senior officials in washington said the obama administration is seriously considering not extending further invitations to iranian diplomats for july 4 celebrations overseas. some invitations had been sent and will not be rescinded, senior administration officials said. the officials said intense discussions on the issue were taking place, but the final decision had not been made. the obama administration had decided to invite iranians to the celebrations at overseas posts as part of obama's policy of engaging the iranian regime. as part of that engagement, obama videotaped a message for the iranian people on the persian new year, and u.s. officials have engaged members of the iranian government. cnn's elise labott and dan lothian contributed to this report.","white house refuses to ""get into the specifics,"" administration official says"

"-- divining what is going in china's opaque political world is like reading tea leaves: it may be interesting but it's ultimately a futile exercise. the 18th congress of the 82-million-member chinese communist party, expected to happen in mid-october, will be a landmark event -- it will usher in a new generation of leaders to rule china for the next 10 years. yet, little is known about what to expect. some changes are imminent. hu jintao, the incumbent president and party general secretary, will step down and be replaced by xi jinping, the current vice president. many members of the 25-member politburo and the 371-member central committee are also expected to be replaced. these are the two policy-making bodies in the party's pyramid organization. who will compose the post-hu leadership? speculation is rife. who are the next generation of chinese leaders? as the congress approaches, political maneuvering has increased among various camps, and there have been a few surprises already. last week, ling jihua, head of the party's general office, which runs the leninist organization's day-to-day affairs and oversees security of the top leaders, was abruptly ""reassigned"" to the important but less powerful united front department. analysts say ling, 55, may still be chosen for the politburo, but he is out of the running for the all-important standing committee -- the very highest decision-making body made up of a handful of key leaders. bo xilai and the politics of chinese succession ""this is evidently a loss for hu jintao,"" said bonnie glaser, senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies (csis), a think tank based in washington d.c. ""ling jihua was a hu protégé. who knows if it was related to the car crash?"" in the early morning on march 18, ling's son, ling gu, 23, was said to have smashed a black ferrari into a concrete-wall on the side of beijing's fourth ring road while driving at high speed. disgraced party chief looms large over china's leadership much was made of the incident in the media internationally, but much of this was rumor and speculation that cnn can not substantiate. reports and discussions about it have been censored from the local media and internet. ling gu may have survived the car crash but it seems to have damaged his father's political career and dented the party's reputation. ""it casts a negative light on corruption among party members and makes the public question the legitimacy of the officials' source of wealth,"" said joseph cheng, a professor at the city university of hong kong. ""it has tarnished the image of the leadership."" did the car scandal benefit xi at the expense of the outgoing hu? other analysts actually credit president hu for the move on ling. ""the leadership is establishing a rule: your son misbehaves, you pay,"" said francesco sisci, a long-time observer of chinese politics. ""this move must have been approved by hu and therefore it does not necessarily weaken him."" ling has been replaced by li zhanshu, 62, a provincial party chief who is known to be an ally of hu and has previous ties with the vice president. li, analysts say, may have been a compromise choice. according to cheng, xi has been smart to avoid clashes with the current leaders. ""what xi needs to do now is to keep a clean slate and a low profile and figure out how to consolidate his power,"" he explained. ""everybody knows he is the presumptive new leader, so he only needs to be patient."" xi also needs to stay above the factional fights. china's leaders are widely seen as divided into two camps: that of retired president jiang zemin and that of president hu. former president and party chief, jiang, retains residual influence even in retirement. the 86 year old has a network of allies in the party -- sometimes known as the ""shanghai faction"" after the former president's time as party leader in the city -- which he uses to influence policy and personnel decisions. last summer jiang was rumored to have died, but he has since made a rare public appearance looking frail but fairly healthy. some china-watchers believe jiang's influence has waned, but others say he remains a player. ""he is still influential,"" said glaser. ""his shanghai faction remains quite important and his people are in key positions."" others say hu's camp, known as the communist youth league (cyl) faction, referring to the youth organization that hu headed for years, will dominate the new leadership. ""the lineup of the standing committee and the full politburo will show that the cyl remains the largest faction,"" said willy lam, a china expert at the chinese university of hong kong. ""the cyl is especially strong among the next tier of leaders, born in the 1960s, who will take over power in 2022."" lam said hu is now in a good position to anoint one of his protégé, hu chunhua, as xi's presumptive successor in 2022 by getting him selected into the next politburo. the younger hu, 49, is a provincial party chief who also headed the cyl. the official line is that the transition is now firmly locked in place, but it would not be china, or the communist party, if it were as straight-forward and predictable as that. ""my guess is that appointments can be changed up until the very last minute,"" sisci said. ""it was so ten years ago, it will even more so today."" qixin wang contributed to this report.",18th congress of the 82-million-member chinese communist party chooses new leadership
"-- it was wednesday morning when i noticed a popular post on reddit that shared an unbelievable photo of a $1,300 hdmi cable. yes. one hdmi cable. thirteen hundred dollars. naturally, i ordered three on my corporate amex and expensed them as ""miscellaneous."" (also recently expensed as miscellaneous: nfl sunday ticket, pop tarts and a pony keg of schlitz. i think hr is on the ninth floor. i'll just head up there now.) at first, i thought it had to be a simple labeling mistake at whatever store the picture was taken. but it was real. a company called audioquest sells diamond brand hdmi cables that cost more than my actual tv. and i fully support it. i mean, somebody must be buying them. granted, i'm not sure how diamond hdmi cables satisfy a rich man's narcissism, but surely these work better than, say, driving around in my saturn. or as all the sexy ladies in atlanta call it ... my saturn. i first entered the dirty world of hdmi cables a couple years ago when i finally purchased a new tv. although, to be slightly more accurate, i finally purchased netflix streaming, and then i had to buy a new tv. first month of netflix streaming: $1,200. you see, since 2006, i had been enjoying an old, 65-inch toshiba that a friend gave me. it was old in that he was more than happy to give it away. and it was large in that it was an actual hippopotamus that somehow aired seinfeld reruns. fast forward to november 2010 when, suddenly, my life wasn't complete without netflix streaming. but there was one little problem: my hippopotamus didn't have the correct hardware in the back to properly connect my laptop. clearly this meant it was time for a new tv. i can be rather impulsive. (i wonder how my facebook stock is doing.) next thing i know there's a 55-inch led lcd in my shopping cart and a kid with pimples trying to tell me why i absolutely, positively needed $40 monster-brand hdmi cables. i admit, his case was compelling. apparently, if i didn't get the good cables, my new tv would grow up to be a serial killer. so i bought the stupid cables and boasted about my big purchase to a colleague at work the next day. ""dude, this tv is great -- netflix is actually built in! and i got these amazing hdmi cables that really bring out the high-def. they only cost like 40 bucks each."" to which he replied, ""shouldn't you be wearing pants?"" he later advised me to buy cheap, $3 cables online, and so far the hd still seems to be coming in perfectly. i can pick out individual hairs in wolf blitzer's beard. which brings us back to diamond cables. the company's website says: ""diamond hdmi incorporates audioquest's highest-performance, lowest-distortion perfect-surface silver conductors. silver is known for its high conductivity and its 'colorless' sonic presentation."" i have no idea what this means, but it seems to suggest that, if i were to buy the diamond cable, wolf's beard actually would jump out of the tv and make me an omelet. i could be wrong. i don't generally get things. and reading through any hdmi discussion online will only further the confusion. some people say quality cables matter. some people say they don't. in the end, it's all ones and zeroes to me. if you look for an expert opinion from consumer reports, however, you'll find they say ""we've long been advocates of not paying for pricey cables, which often do little more than pad the pockets of the manufacturers that make them and the retailers that sell them."" the only reasons to buy anything but low-end cables, they say, is if you plan to unplug and replug the cables all the time or if the cable is longer than 30 feet. otherwise, ""any high-speed cable should suffice,"" the group says, ""and don't let a package or retail associate tell you otherwise."" still, you've got to hand it to them. audioquest cares about performance, and they seem to specialize in super-high-end everything. i actually found a $6,900 ac power cable on amazon. audioquest calls it the nrg wel signature series. i call it ""miscellaneous."" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jarrett bellini.","audioquest sells diamond brand hdmi cables for $1,300"
"a leading humanitarian organization has urged soccer's ruling body fifa and the qatari government to honor their commitment to reform employment laws for migrant workers ahead of the 2022 world cup, amid fears that stadiums will be built using an exploited labor force. human rights watch (hrw) has compiled a 146-page report -- ""building a better world cup: protecting migrant workers"" -- examining qatar's recruitment and employment system, where 94% of its workforce are migrant workers. the qatari government recently suggested it will replace the current sponsorship scheme -- where all foreigners must be sponsored by local employers to work and reside in the country -- with a system of contracts between employers and employees. but hrw said that it might prove of no benefit to the workers constructing the stadiums needed to host the tournament. ""the government needs to ensure that the cutting-edge, high-tech stadiums it's planning to build for world cup fans are not built on the backs of abused and exploited workers,"" hrw's middle east director sarah leah whitson said. ""workers building stadiums won't benefit from qatar's general promise to end the sponsorship system. they need a deadline for this to happen before their work for the fifa games starts."" qatar is smaller than the bahamas in land area, has less than 300,000 citizens, but boasts the highest per capita gdp in the world. but in hrw's interviews with 73 migrant construction workers they reported a host of problems, including unpaid wages, illegal salary deductions, crowded and unsanitary labor camps, and unsafe working conditions. the qatari labor ministry denies that workers are being exploited. ""the ministry has received no complaint of forced labor and it is inconceivable that such a thing exists in qatar as the worker may break his contract and return to his country whenever he wishes and the employer cannot force him to remain in the country against his will,"" it said in a letter to hrw, an international non-governmental organization which conducts research on human rights. the report seeks to address apparent concerns over worker safety in qatar's construction industry and claims that discrepancies exist between the number of construction worker deaths reported by local embassies and the number reported by the government. while the nepali embassy reported 191 nepali worker deaths in 2010, and the indian embassy reported 98 indian migrant deaths -- ncluding 45 deaths of young, low-income workers due to cardiac arrest, so far in 2012 -- the qatar labor ministry says there have no more than six worker deaths over the last three years. qatar's success in being chosen by fifa as 2022 world cup hosts is likely to mean an anticipated construction boom in the arab state. the local organizing committee for the tournament, the supreme committee for qatar 22, and the company it appointed to help oversee world cup construction, ch2m hill, have said they will establish labor standards that builders and other contractors hired to build world cup venues must meet. fifa, meanwhile, has pledged to raise worker rights issues with the qatar government. those commitments are a beginning, hrw says, but it wants additional steps, including minimum employee standards in line with qatari law and international labor standards for private contractors involved in world cup-related construction. ""ensuring international standards for workers' rights and conditions has and will continue to be at the forefront of our committee's strategic planning and implementation,"" said the the qatar 2022 supreme committee.

""they (the government) asked me to prepare a report and present it to them showing that the victims were killed by the protesters,"" bakkour said. the attorney general also accused security services of torturing and killing more than 300 demonstrators. cnn cannot independently confirm these claims. the government in damascus has denied repeated requests for cnn journalists to visit syria. soon after the release of bakkour's video resignation, the syrian state news agency sana fired back, saying the attorney general had been coerced by kidnappers to make false statements. citing an unnamed ""official source"" in the city of hama, sana wrote that ""armed terrorist groups who kidnapped"" bakkour ""forced him to say these lies at gunpoint."" the sana article accused the arabic news channel al jazeera of collaborating with kidnappers to mislead syrian public opinion. but hours later, bakkour was back on camera in another video uploaded to youtube. this time, he appeared standing, wearing the same suit, but now without a tie. ""what syrian tv broadcast that i had been kidnapped by armed groups is untrue,"" bakkour said. ""i am now protected by the rebels and i am in good health. today is wednesday august 31st. shabiha (pro-government militia) tried to kidnap me today but they failed to do so. i will make live statements as soon as i leave syria, soon."" if bakkour has in fact defected, it would mark a major blow to the syrian government, said one prominent syrian activist in exile,. ""he (bakkour) has been appointed directly by the minister of justice. he is the highest authority among all the judges in hama,"" said rami abdulrahman, director of the london-based syrian observatory of human rights. ""we cannot confirm whether or not he has defected or whether he has been kidnapped,"" abdulrahman added. the western syrian city of hama has been at the center of the protests, with fierce crackdowns last month that included military tanks and government forces raiding homes. since the uprising first erupted in syria more than five months ago, a number of men have appeared in similar videos wearing military uniforms and announcing their defection from the syrian army. meanwhile, syrian state tv has also broadcast televised confessions of men who claimed to commit acts of political violence on the part of the syrian opposition. the united nations human rights commissioner has reported that more than 2,200 people have been killed since the security forces launched a bloody campaign to crush anti-government protests last march. citing a pattern of widespread, systematic human rights abuses, un human rights commissioner navi pillay says the damascus regime may be guilty of ""crimes against humanity.""",state media reports that he was kidnapped by seven gunmen
"-- roger federer and stan wawrinka each faced questions heading into switzerland's davis cup final in france. for federer, how would his tender back hold up? for wawrinka, would he recover after a tough -- and contentious -- loss to his higher-profile swiss at the world tour finals in london last week? we got our answers friday at the stade pierre mauroy on a record setting day in lille -- but for once federer wasn't the one rewriting the history books. in front of the largest ever tennis crowd for a pro match -- at 27,432 it eclipsed the 27,200 that turned up to watch spain beat the u.s. in a converted seville bullring in the 2004 davis cup final -- federer not only fell to gael monfils but couldn't put up much of a fight. the 6-1 6-4 6-3 result against monfils -- who piped down his histrionics -- marked his most lopsided defeat in 45 singles matches in the competition. ""you accept the fact that you're playing the way you feel,"" federer told reporters. ""but it wasn't all negative. i started to feel better as the match went on. that's very encouraging, i must say."" also encouraging for federer and the swiss, wawrinka thumped a listless jo-wilfried tsonga 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-2 to begin the day. federer's performance, coupled with france's apparent advantage in saturday's doubles, means it's the home team who'll be happier come the end of play. one of the two major titles to elude federer in his glittering career is a davis cup crown and how disappointed he must have been that on his debut in a davis cup final he was at less than full strength. monfils, however, remains one of the most athletic players in the game and owned a pair of wins over federer. with french captain arnaud clement able to rein him in during changeovers, he played focused tennis. ""definitely one of the top three matches in my life,"" said monfils, who squandered two match points against federer at the u.s. open. monfils broke early in the first and facing an immediate break point, struck a courageous second-serve ace that delighted his many fans. clay can be classified as the least forgiving of surfaces when it comes to unforced errors, which made monfils' tally of 44 winners and 18 unforced errors extremely impressive. in truth at times he was quick to pounce on short federer balls. he earned the key break at 2-2 in the third in breath-taking fashion, slamming a forehand down the line and later in the game sliding into his backhand prior to sending it past federer and down the line. and what a way to end it: monfils produced another shot down the line, a backhand from a difficult angle. wawrinka, meanwhile, sparkled against french no. 1 tsonga, displaying some of the artillery that won him the australian open in january for a maiden grand slam title. his stats were even better than monfils' -- 61 winners and 29 unforced errors. ""i know how to play those matches,"" wawrinka said. ""i did so many big matches, so many important matches this year. ""today it's important to show them that i'm there. they (were) maybe too focused (on) roger and maybe they forgot about me."" he showed no after effects of the loss to federer, when he blew four match points and was reportedly taunted by federer's wife, mirka. for large parts of the affair he targeted tsonga's backhand with his own sublime one-handed backhand, easily getting the better of the 2008 australian open finalist. at one stage, even the crowd -- most of course were rooting for les bleus -- admired wawrinka's laser-like backhand in reply to a slack tsonga forehand volley. wawrinka stormed to the first set and when he held a break point to begin the second, it appeared as if the swiss no. 2's better form would see him cruise in three. but tsonga hung on, altered the momentum and for a brief spell in the third set was in the ascendancy. the loudest the crowd got in the opener was in that third set, when an agitated tsonga implored them off their feet when he saved a set point with an ace at 2-5. the outstretched arms of clement at precisely the same time suggested an expression of, 'it's about time,' and the swiss cow bells were temporarily silenced. there's no doubt that wawrinka was slightly rattled. tsonga smelled blood when wawrinka trailed 0-30 on serve, but the latter rallied to close out the set -- and the match, realistically -- despite double faulting on one of his set points. tsonga was annoyed with his performance but also with the french fans, who he felt weren't vocal enough. ""when the teams were introduced, they applauded stan more than us, roger more than us,"" he said. ""we hear the swiss spectators more than we hear the french ones. ""stan, for example, announced that the ball was out, and it was in. ""i just went to check the mark, and i was booed in my own country -- maybe not by the french spectators but by the swiss spectators. it's annoying."" with monfils' victory over federer, it guaranteed so-called 'live' action sunday and clement would surprise a few if he stuck with the out-of-sorts tsonga to begin the reverse singles. for the time being, federer isn't ruling himself out of saturday's doubles. ""now i'm coming out of the match without any pain, which is good, too,"" said federer. ""it was not a five-setter (that left) me totally exhausted. so if i have to find something positive about it, i'll say that. ""but it is clear that i want to play better. if i play the doubles and the singles, it needs to be a lot better than today. now i have the information and i know exactly what i have to do."" wawrinka and federer both aren't scheduled to play doubles but they can be called upon saturday.",switzerland and france are tied after the opening day of the davis cup final in lille
"-- kenya's military controls half of the somalian port city of kismayo as it tries to drive out the al qaeda-linked militant group al-shabaab from one of its last strongholds, a military spokesman said saturday. kenyan and somali ground forces are in control of the northern part, which is the old city, after a day and a half of fighting, spokesman cyrus oguna told cnn. they are consolidating the areas they have gained before moving into the south, where the islamic militant group is believed to be, he said. the military launched airstrikes against the group saturday. ""al-shabaab has not been able to offer any resistance whatsoever to the ground forces since the ground forces landed there yesterday, and the whole of yesterday and the good part of today they have (suffered) heavy casualties,"" oguna said. more: mogadishu bombing kills somali broadcaster the kenya defense forces inflicted ""massive destruction"" on al-shabaab's infrastructure saturday, using jets and helicopter gunships to destroy three of the group's bases, according to the military's official twitter account. ""great care and caution has been exercised to avoid collateral damage,"" it said. but in a series of posts saturday on a twitter account often used by al-shabaab, the group said the kenyan military is ""waging a losing battle"" in kismayo. it said mujahedeen forces ambushed kenyan troops 30 km (18 miles) west of kismayo, destroying three vehicles and killing dozens of troops in a two-hour battle. oguna said those reports are ""pure propaganda."" ""there has been no major ground forces engagement,"" he said. kenya's military makes up the majority of troops in an african union offensive to drive al-shabaab out of somalia, where the group has long tried to overthrow the government. al-shabaab has suffered setbacks in the fight, including losing control of much of the capital, mogadishu, last year. that made kismayo even more critical for the group, which uses the port to profit from the illegal charcoal trade and smuggling operations. more: soldiers killed in blast targeting somali president thousands of civilians fled the city this month as fighting loomed, according to the u.n. refugee agency. it said that somalis were leaving in minibuses, in trucks and on donkey carts. ""great care and caution has been exercised to avoid collateral damage,"" the kenyan military said saturday. since crossing into somalia in october, kenyan commanders and politicians have stated more than once that capturing kismayo was the ultimate aim of their operation. the military's operation to take kismayo began with airstrikes and naval gun support three days before the ground troops arrived, oguna said. twitter postings friday from kenya's prime minister and deputy prime minister congratulating the military on capturing kismayo actually referred to the ground forces' arrival in the city, oguna said.",the kenyan military says it controls half of kismayo

"""live every week like it's shark week."" those immortal words come not from the discovery channel's marketing department but from tracy morgan on ""30 rock."" believe it or not, there once was a time when there was no shark week. it wasn't until famed oceanographer jacques cousteau's 1956 documentary, ""the silent world,"" that people began to see what the world under the sea was really like. ""jacques cousteau changed the way ocean exploration was done,"" said eric stackpole, who along with partner david lang is behind a submersible robotic watercraft -- sort of an underwater drone -- that could open a whole new world of undersea exploration. cousteau ""invited people to explore along with him, and so for us it's the same thing,"" said lang. their invention, called an openrov, is a submarine-like robot that you control with your laptop. it gives scientists, explorers and other users a glimpse of what lies below the surface, without them getting wet. ""r-o-v stands for remotely operated vehicle"" stackpole said. ""it's got a video camera on it, so you can see what it sees live. so i can put this in the water, fly it around and see what it sees."" the openrov is about the size of a toaster and is engineered to go to depths of up to 100 meters. underwater rovs have been used for research for years. but the biggest difference between the openrov and the one, say, james cameron uses, is the price. the openrov sells for $849. it's not what everyone would call cheap, but you don't need a grant to get your hands on one. this affordability is how stackpole and lang hope to bring openrov to the masses, turning average people into cousteau-like undersea adventurers. plan for a new kind of spy plane ""if you think about ocean exploration right now, it's something that a lot of people think, 'oh, well, you know, what that's something that professional scientists do, that national geographic explorers do. that's not something that i get to do,' "" lang said, ""i think that's what we're trying to instill back in everyone."" the two met when stackpole was interning with nasa and lang was between jobs, and both immediately bonded over the idea of a new way to explore the ocean. ""when we first met almost three years ago ... within 10 minutes eric told me a story about this underwater cave,"" lang said. ""within a half an hour we were talking about, 'well, what if we could build an underwater robot that could go and roam the ocean and anyone could go on and control it from the internet?"" the project started in their garage in cupertino, california -- home to some other famous tech innovators: apple. but once they turned to kickstarter last year, they saw how many people were truly interested in taking the plunge. ""we set a goal for $20,000 and ended up raising that in about two hours, which is really exciting,"" lang said. ""it's fun to watch the kind of dollar amounts go up, but then you quickly realize, 'oh my god, we have to build all these things.' "" there are over 500 openrovs in use now around the globe. even though the project is growing, stackpole and lang are sticking with their do-it-yourself ethos. the openrovs are an open-source project, meaning that anyone can hack them to create new features or uses for the devices. lang and stackpole sell the rovs as kits, and customers put them together themselves. meet your friendly neighborhood drones it's a process that helps get everyone involved in the production and design aspect. ""we have people from well over 50 countries in our community who can all contribute to how to make the design better and how to use it better,"" stackpole said. among those interested in openrovs are conservation groups who want to check on invasive fish species and teachers who want to use them in the classroom, lang said. building a community of users to provide input is another way the openrov is unique. it also explains the first half of the name. ""openrov is an open-source community,"" stackpole said. ""if the rov is having some sort of a problem and we can't figure out how to handle it, i can go onto the forums and post, 'hey, this is a problem i'm having,' and as i sleep, the problem is going across europe and people who are experts are answering it because they find it interesting. ""by the time i wake up, it's going to cross the u.s., and by lunch i can have five or six good solutions."" with a flow of new ideas coming in from all over the world, stackpole and lang have decided not to get a patent for the openrov -- at least not yet. this makes it easier for them to upgrade with new tech and designs. ""for us, we want to innovate as quickly as possible. we want to come up with new designs and revolutionize how underwater exploration is done rather than committing to one design,"" said stackpole. ""we've been designing the rov around parts that are not even in existence yet, but that we know are emerging."" as the openrov evolves and improves, this approach may allow for more exploration in uncharted waters. ""people often ask, 'is it something that's just kind of a toy that's fun to build and play with, or is it something that you expect to be used by real researchers?' and our answer certainly is, 'both,' "" stackpole said. jacques cousteau would certainly be proud.",a new submersible robot -- sort of an underwater drone -- could open up undersea exploration
"(cnn)the private spaceflight company spacex will launch another mission to the international space station on tuesday, but the real highlight of the event could be back on earth. a falcon 9 rocket will lift the cargo into orbit, and for the first time, the company will try to land the rocket's first stage on a floating platform. traditionally, rockets have been designed to fall back to earth after separating from the spacecraft they lifted, and then burn up on reentry or crash into the ocean. the millions of dollars that go into the production of the rockets burn, too. spacex wants to pioneer a reusable rocket, a development that could change the economics of space travel. ""a fully and rapidly reusable rocket -- which has never been done before -- is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access,"" spacex said in a news release. the company has twice attempted soft landings of the falcon 9's first stage on water. those tests showed that the rocket is capable of reducing its speed from hypersonic to nearly zero, and deploy landing legs. in those tests, the rocket tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean, causing damage that made the rocket unusable. that was according to plan, spacex said. on tuesday, the company will try the same soft landing for the falcon 9's first stage, but this time on a custom-built floating platform it calls the autonomous spaceport drone ship. landing on the platform ""is significantly more challenging"" than the water landings, the company said. for one, the platform is not anchored, and while the platform looks large from the ground, it is a rather small target for the 14-story-tall rocket. spacex described reentry and landing as ""trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm."" the company puts the odds of success at 50% at best. it adds, however, that this is just the first of a number of tests toward the goal of landing a rocket stage for reuse. as for tuesday's target, ""x"" marks the spot: the company will try to land the rocket stage on the spacex logo painted on the center of the floating platform.",spacex is scheduled to launch a rocket tuesday

"-- dozens of suspected terrorists released by the united states from guantanamo bay, cuba, are believed to have returned to terrorism activities, according to the pentagon. pentagon officials say 61 former gitmo detainees have committed or are suspected of returning to terrorism. since 2002, 61 former detainees have committed or are suspected to have committed attacks after being released from the detention camp, pentagon spokesman geoff morrell said at a briefing tuesday. the number is up since the pentagon's last report in march 2008 when officials said 37 former detainees had been suspected of returning to the battlefield since 2002. since 2007, more than 100 detainees were released, significantly more than in previous years, according to pentagon officials. according to the statistics, of the 61 former detainees that are believed to have returned to fighting, 18 have been officially confirmed while 43 are suspected, morrell said. the 18 were confirmed through intelligence, photographs, fingerprints and other information, morrell said. of the 43 other detainees suspected of taking part in terrorist attacks, only ""plausible reporting"" on their activities indicated some kind of involvement, according to morrell. officials would only identify one of the confirmed attackers, adballah salih al-ajmi, a kuwaiti man released from u.s. custody at the guantanamo bay naval base in 2005. pentagon officials said salih al-ajmi blew himself up in a suicide attack in iraq in april 2008. since 2002, the pentagon has released about 520 detainees to their home countries or counties that agreed to take them. some have been released in full by those countries while others are still being held. ""there, clearly, are people who are being held at guantanamo who are still bent on doing harm to america, americans and our allies, so there will have to be some solution for the likes of them,"" morrell said. about 250 detainees remain held at guantanamo and about 60 of those detainees have been cleared for release by the pentagon, but their home countries will not take them or the u.s. believes they could be harmed by their governments if returned. president-elect barack obama has said he intends to shut down guantanamo. earlier this week, two sources close to the obama transition team said he could issue an order to do so as early as his first week in office, saying that obama believes ""the legal framework at gitmo has failed to successfully and swiftly prosecute terrorists.""","61 former gitmo detainees still involved in terror acts, according to pentagon"
"-- wednesday night in denver, mitt romney tried to imply that president barack obama had given $90 billion in tax breaks to solar and wind companies. after first noting (more accurately) that $90 billion went to the ""green energy world,"" romney followed up with ""don't forget... you put $90 billion -- like 50 years worth of breaks -- into solar and wind."" personally, i wish the president had. but it just isn't true. the actual number was more like $21 billion. i know, because i helped oversee the administration's efforts in this area. the larger number refers to all of the investments in the 2009 stimulus package that the administration designated ""green"" in any way. the number included $6 billion for advanced batteries to make electric cars possible, $29 billion for energy efficiency and home retrofits, $3 billion for job training, and even $18 billion for transit and high speed rail. to pretend that all of that money went to solar and wind companies is ludicrous. worse, romney alleged that the administration picked only ""losers."" false. first of all, many of these initiatives began under president george w. bush, including some of the loan guarantee programs romney likes to attack. with the exception of solyndra, the track record for renewable energy investments is strong. in fact, the failure rate is lower than congress anticipated when they created these programs -- and, while we're on the topic, higher than romney's 80% success rate at bain capital. cnn fact check: are half of green energy firms funded by stimulus out of business? the bureau of labor statistics says that there are 3.1 million green jobs in the united states right now. this is a big success story for obama. today, there are 75,000 americans employed in the wind energy business alone, compared with 81,000 coal miners. today, the top three clean-tech states each employ more people in green jobs than the coal industry does nationwide. romney is willing to jeopardize those jobs by arguing for killing the wind energy tax credit -- while refusing to end subsidies and supports for the fossil fuel industry. opinion: millenials to candidates: talk to us (by the way: coal employment is still high. regulations that place more stringent public health standards on coal mining have actually created more jobs in coal mining industry, thanks to epa. even if the number of miners goes down at some point, i would blame dynamite, not government regulations. more and more, ""mountaintop removal"" is the standard practice for coal companies, and simply blowing up a mountain to scrape the coal out requires fewer workers. ) romney is right that obama has not been willing to open up some public lands for oil drilling and coal mining. that is a good thing. if it were left up to people like romney, there might be oil rigs in places like the grand canyon. that approach not only desecrates our nation's natural beauty, it is an unnecessary and excessive risk. the united states is on its way to being a net oil exporter, without jeopardizing the beauty and integrity of our public lands. both conservatives and liberals should be happy with obama's energy policies. oil, coal and natural gas production is up, which should please the right. but energy efficiency and conservation is also up, which should please the left. romney -- like his running mate, paul ryan -- sounds great when he is spinning his yarns about america under obama. but he knows precious little about the renewable energy industry and is relying on tea party talking points to score cheap points, at the expense of america's clean energy entrepreneurs. there is an upside: this fall, both ryan and romney have already created a full employment program -- for fact checkers. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of van jones.","van jones: mitt romney was wrong to imply adminsitration spent $90 billion on solar, wind"

"(sunset) -- by the time we arrive at ceàgo del lago winery, on the northwestern shore of lake county's clear lake, we've seen far more birds than people. western grebes, thousands of them, bob peacefully until our boat gets directly in front of them. then they dive upside down like toy ducks, showing their black-and-white behinds before disappearing under the surface. lake county, california, is a haven for water recreation. so when we pull up to ceàgo, we're almost surprised to see a couple of bass fishermen casting right off the dock. people at last! ""catch anything?"" my husband calls out. ""nah,"" says one, without looking up. his friend chimes in, ""but at least it's a nice place to hang out."" and then, gesturing to ceàgo: ""and the wine over there's pretty good too."" the scene sums up what's so nice about visiting northern california's lake county. even with a burgeoning wine scene, lake county is still first and foremost a haven of water recreation and summertime fun. if you're looking for the opposite of tony napa, it doesn't get much more un-napa than this. the fun center of the wine country two-and-a-half hours north of san francisco and two hours northwest of sacramento, clear lake has long been party central for college kids drawn here for water-skiing, boating and concerts at konocti harbor. though that element certainly still exists, now there are also a few very sophisticated restaurants and hotels (the blue wing saloon and the tallman hotel, most notably), as well as 10 or so worthwhile wineries. among those is the only boat-in winery we've ever heard of. (travel planner: hotels, restaurants, wineries) it's a concept we can't resist. roy disney, of disney's boat rentals, sets us up at the boat launch in lakeport, instructing us to head east first to ""the narrows,"" where the north arm of the lake connects to the south arm, before the lake gets choppy. he tells us how to use mt. konocti -- the once-active volcano that looms several thousand feet above the lake -- as a landmark, and invites us to call his cell phone if we lose our bearings. though it's still morning, we're dying to check out ceàgo -- we'll have just a sip, we rationalize. we head north toward the lake's western shore, passing clear lake state park. we briefly consider stopping here for a hike (the park has boat access as well), but decide against it, figuring that today should be all about boat rides and decadence. a few miles northwest of the park, we glimpse the dock of ceàgo, looking like an arm outstretched in a gesture of welcome. after we've chatted with the fishermen, we tie up the boat and walk up the dock into a mediterranean-style garden that could easily be mistaken for one beside italy's lake como. a lavender-lined path leads through gardens framed by olive trees. in front of us is a courtyard where a fountain burbles and festive music plays. people come and go in and out of a tasting room tucked into a series of hacienda-style buildings. the place feels more like a spa than a winery -- and in fact, it will eventually be both, jim fetzer tells us. fetzer, whose family produced an annual 2.5 million cases of wines in the 1980s and '90s, discovered lake county as a teenager, when his father used to take him on grape-buying trips. after the fetzer family sold the company and the name, jim bought a 163-acre piece of prime lakefront property in the then not-so-nice town of nice (pronounced like the city in france) and set about creating the county's first resortlike destination. he plans to break ground on the spa as well as a restaurant in two to three years. ""lake county could be the fun center of the wine country,"" fetzer says, gesturing out to the lake, where a seaplane is floating, flanked by a group of teenagers sunning themselves on inner tubes. after calling out a welcome to the group -- which, it turns out, is celebrating a birthday out here on the lake -- fetzer tells us about the seaplane access he's just created, and the ferry system he's working on putting in place. he talks about lake county's clean air (the best in the state, he claims), the lack of fog, the tremendous birdlife. ""being on the lake, making wine, it doesn't get much better,"" he says. on the way back to lakeport, at fetzer's urging, we stop at rodman slough, a wetlands preserve just a few miles west of ceàgo. we kill the engine, and slowly, an audubon scene comes to life before our eyes: a great blue heron stands stately in the tule reeds; a grebe dives for its prey. i say that i can't believe all the birdlife here.

"-- a court in northern japan found two greenpeace activists guilty monday for stealing whale meat, but suspended their sentences, greenpeace japan said. the aomori district court ruled that the activists, junichi sato and toru suzuki, will only have to serve one-year terms if they commit a crime in the next three years, greenpeace said. in a press conference after the verdict, sato said greenpeace would appeal the case. he said monday's sentence was ""unfair"" and ""preventing the citizens' right to know."" suzuki said in a statement that the sentence was disproportionate and undeserved. iwc's shame: japan's whale slaughter ""we set out to reveal the truth about the government's whaling program, but instead have been punished, while those behind the misuse of public money walk free,"" he said. the case highlights rising tensions between anti-whaling activists and japanese officials. japan's whaling has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocacy groups, who claim it involves the cruel slaughter of whales so that meat can be sold in markets and restaurants. japanese officials say their hunts are permitted under rules that prohibit commercial whaling but allow whaling for scientific reasons. greenpeace has said a tip led sato and suzuki to a whaling ship smuggling the whale meat onto the black market. in a press conference, sato announced that they had found 23 kilograms (50.7 lbs) of whale meat in a box they intercepted. he showed the whale meat in the box, and alleged a systematic, large-scale embezzlement within japan's whaling program. greenpeace delivered the whale meat to the tokyo prosecutor's office days later. the police moved, but not on the greenpeace allegations. ""they dropped the case and we are the ones who got arrested,"" sato said in an interview earlier this year. sato and suzuki were arrested in june 2008 and charged with trespassing and theft. they faced up to 10 years behind bars. regardless of the reason, police said, it was theft because greenpeace admitted that it intercepted the box. reaction outside of japan was swift. protests were held around the world in support of the men, who came to be known as the ""tokyo two."" and a u.n. human rights body declared japan's trial of the men a violation of human rights. joji morishita of the japan fisheries agency has said the government recognizes the right of protest, but activists will be punished if they break japan's laws. but greenpeace international's executive director, who traveled to japan for the ruling, said monday that the organization was determined to get the activists' ""unjust"" conviction overturned. ""activists are not criminals, and to treat them as such has a chilling effect in society, undermining the quality of democracy,"" executive director kumi naidoo said in a statement after monday's ruling. in july, a japanese court found peter bethune, an environmental activist from new zealand, guilty on five charges, ranging from assault against whalers to trespassing into a whaling vessel. he was given a two-year suspended prison sentence and five years' probation wednesday by a tokyo district court judge for throwing butyric acid at a whaling ship, jumping aboard and attempting to make a citizen's arrest of the captain.","new: greenpeace international's executive director says the ruling is ""unjust"""

"-- as an organization they're used to investing billions of dollars in scientific experiments that further our knowledge of earth and space. but the only bill to speak of on this occasion is orange and attached to the body of a rubber duck. scientists from nasa hope that rubber ducks will help them better understand glacier movements. in the name of climate change science, researchers at nasa have dropped 90 rubber ducks into holes of greenland's fastest moving glacier: the jakobshavn glacier in baffin bay. scientists remain unsure as to why glaciers speed up their movement in the summer months and it is hoped that the rubber ducks -- labeled with the words ""science experiment"" and ""reward"" in three languages, along with an email address -- will shed some light on the phenomenon. one theory is that the summer sun melts ice on the surface of the glacier which creates pools of water which then flow into moulins -- narrow tubular shafts in the glacier. these then transport the water from the top to the underside of the glacier. it's thought that this base water acts as a lubricant to speed up the movement of the glacier towards the sea. it is hoped the ducks will help show how the water moves through the ice. in conjunction with the ducks, nasa has also launched a gps probe which they hope will tell them more about the inner workings of the glacier. so far, neither the probe nor any of the ducks have turned up. alberto behar of nasa's jet propulsion laboratory in california told reuters: ""we haven't heard back but it may take some time until somebody actually finds it and decides to send us an e-mail that they have found it."" the jakobshavn glacier is responsible for seven percent of all ice which is peeling off greenland and its ice sheets could contribute to sea levels rising this century. the glacier's menace was also felt last century. experts believe that it was the source of the iceberg which sank the titanic in 1912. it's not the first time rubber ducks have helped scientists track water flows. thousands fell into the sea in 1992 when a container ship bound for seattle from china shed its load in a storm in the pacific ocean. the ducks spent years at sea and washed up in all corners of the globe, telling oceanographers much about the surface currents of the oceans.",nasa scientists launch a flotilla of 90 rubber ducks to investigate ice melt in glacier

"-- the people have spoken and president barack obama has another four years in office. when it comes to the economy we know what the president wants to do in his second term. obama's measures are incremental and nuanced, with the exception of the most talked about, which is raising taxes on higher income earners. this will be done by not renewing the bush-era tax cuts for those at the top, and by a so-called buffet-rule, an overarching principle that would set a minimum rate of tax payable by those earning more than a million dollars a year, and prevent them from going below that using deductions. the tax cuts for the middle class under the bush-era would be made permanent. thereafter it is a real hodge podge of tax incentives, advantages, allowances and policies designed to stimulate business and bring jobs back to america. none of them are eye catching. it is hard to get excited about the manufacturing communities tax credit or the american renewable energy production tax credit, however important they may be. obama has also talked of taking a more muscular approach to china when it comes to trade. having been goaded by mitt romney on the campaign trail, the u.s. has indicated that the next four years will have to see china playing on a level playing field. unfortunately saying and doing are two different things. the president spent much of his first term just putting out the fires. as the economist put it in its endorsement, he ""dragged america's economy back from the brink of disaster."" it could have been a great deal worse. but his supporters say he hasn't had a true chance to effect real change and that will be up for grabs. if, as seems possible, the u.s. economy does continue to grow at around 2% to 3% over the next few years -- not fast enough for a massive reduction in unemployment or new spending -- he might be able to at least advance his non-crisis management policies. but hang on. i am getting ahead of myself. before any of this comes to fruition the single most important task the president faces: stopping the country going over the fiscal cliff. the cliff comes about because of a rare confluence of events. the expiration of tax cuts, the implementation of mandatory spending cuts, the limitation of certain benefits and so on. if it all happened at once, come january next year, it's estimated it could take a toll of 4% of u.s. gdp. this would comfortably push the economy into recession. congress and the president have to find a way to pull back from the cliff. and that will be job number one over the next few months of the lame duck congress and into the new year. even the threat of the cliff is having a depressing effect on business decisions. if they dilly and dally about sorting it out then the damage that could be caused between now and inauguration could easily outdo any benefit the president may make in the early years of his second term. there is one other economic issue where the president can't do very much. and that is the european sovereign debt crisis. bully. cajole. berate. treasury secretary tim geithner has tried them all. fundamentally the u.s. has to sit on the sidelines, watch, wait and pray the europeans get their act together. it looks like there will also have to be a new economic team. it is widely expected (although not confirmed) that geithner won't stay much longer at treasury. he has done four years and it's believed he wants to move back to new york. if he goes then one of the most important joists in the obama economic team has gone. the chairman of the federal reserve ben bernanke -- who has just launched qe3 -- will be there longer. his term doesn't expire until 2014, about a year into obama's second term. (it's an ultimate irony that bernanke will be gone -- if not reappointed -- before the 2015 date that the federal open market committee currently has as its target for keeping interest rates at exceptionally low levels). what we have seen over the past 12 months in the u.s. economy is likely to be the story of the next 12 months. incremental, slow improvements as both consumers continue to pay down debt, and repair their household finances. the posh word for this is deleveraging. business may have lots of cash but with so much uncertainty and worry they are not about to spend it. hoarding money will continue until there is tangible solid evidence that growth is sustainable (we are seeing some signs -- consumer confidence, house prices, housing starts, durable numbers etc -- but it is still tentative). the banks have slowly rebuilt their capital base and if the economy continues this gradual progression then we can expect lending to begin....but again....it's expected to be slow. in that case, unemployment will continue its very gradual decrease. with economic growth around 2% to 3% for the next few years, jobs will be created at a much slower rate than needed to make a serious dent in the overall level of joblessness. even the fed doesn't see things getting much better anytime soon on the jobs front. i have said it before. today's economies (especially the u.s.) are like a patient who has suffered cancer, leukemia and a brain tumor all at the same time. surgery has removed much of the damage. chemotherapy continues to be administered. the patient is going to take time to recover. for obama, the goal will be to have policies that move from triage to rehabilitation and finally to better times. perhaps the big unknown for this president is exactly how he will start the long, painful and politically devastating business of cutting the deficit. having had pretty much universal agreement from the imf, world bank, oecd and others that now was not the time for retrenchment, we are coming to that time when addressing the u.s. budget deficit will be a priority. the second term starts that process. unfortunately, as we saw during the budget summit last year, that may be almost impossible. there's also the matter of seeing the exact nature of the congress too. the u.s. lost its coveted aaa rating under obama. this was the unthinkable, and it happened. in term two he would be wise to get ahead of this deficit curve. we know what the president says he wants to do. we know the policies he hopes to introduce. now he just has to do it.",obama plans to introduce tax hikes on highest earners and keep middle class tax cuts
"-- top democrats put the issue of climate change back in the spotlight tuesday, debating legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions while announcing $3.4 billion in new clean energy funds. a key congressional committee began hearings on a ""cap-and-trade"" bill requiring emissions to be cut by more than 80 percent over the next four decades. questions related to global warming have been among the most politically contentious in recent years. democrats are generally more receptive to proposals designed to curb energy consumption in order to slow climate change; leading republicans continue to express concern about the necessity and economic impact of such measures. president obama has made the push for greater investment in a clean energy agenda one of his top domestic priorities. attempting to move that agenda forward, the senate environment and public works committee kicked off hearings on the clean energy jobs and american power act. supporters say the bill would reduce nationwide greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 through a cap-and-trade program under which companies would buy and sell emissions credits. almost one-third of the credits would be given away to the electric power sector through 2026 in an effort to diminish negative economic effects. leading democrats have expressed optimism that the bill would help stimulate the creation of new ""green energy"" jobs. the measure is similar to a climate change bill narrowly passed by the house of representatives in june. scientists ""tell us that we have a narrow window of time in which to avert the ravages of global warming,"" said sen. barbara boxer, d-california. boxer, who chairs the environment committee, called the legislation ""our best insurance against a dangerous future."" it is ""a responsible approach that sets attainable goals for gradual reductions in carbon emissions, and it protects consumers, businesses and workers as we move toward clean energy,"" she said. committee republicans tore into the measure. it is ""a tax, and it will mean more economic pain and suffering and fewer jobs,"" warned sen. james inhofe, r-oklahoma. ""the victims of cap-and-trade can't just move on and get new, green jobs. the transition will mean leaving high-paying jobs, moving away from hometowns and significant reductions in lifetime earnings,"" he said. administration officials testified on behalf of the bill, including energy secretary steven chu, transportation secretary ray lahood, interior secretary ken salazar and epa administrator lisa jackson. in all, 54 witnesses are scheduled to testify on the bill over the next three days. obama, meanwhile, unveiled what the white house called the largest energy grid modernization investment in american history. at a florida solar energy center, the president announced $3.4 billion in smart grid investment grant awards. ""by facilitating the creation of a clean energy economy, building this 21st century energy infrastructure will help us lay a foundation for lasting growth and prosperity,"" obama said. the white house said the awards, which are being funded through the $787 billion stimulus act, will fund ""a broad range of technologies that will spur the nation's transition to a smarter, stronger, more efficient and reliable electric system."" among other things, the awards will help support the installation of ""smart meters"" designed to help consumers monitor and control their energy consumption. the awards, going to 100 private companies, utilities and cities, will be divided into grants ranging from $400,000 to $200 million. they will be matched by $4.7 billion in private sector funds. vice president joe biden also highlighted the issue of global warming tuesday, visiting a former general motors plant in delaware that is being converted to allow for the production of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. the plant is being purchased by california-based fisker automotive for an estimated $18 million. the new climate change push is being made against a backdrop of broad public support for federal action to slow global warming. six in 10 americans support a cap-and-trade proposal to cut pollution, according to a new cnn/opinion research corp. survey. thirty-seven percent are opposed to such a plan. the survey indicates a generational divide, with 68 percent of americans under age 50 supporting cap-and-trade, but those 50 and older split on the issue. ""this is one more example of the growing generation gap that is shaping politics and policy in this country,"" said keating holland, cnn polling director. ""younger americans voted for obama and tend to welcome change. older americans were less enamored of change in the 2008 election, and senior citizens were the only age group that voted for john mccain."" the poll also suggests a partisan divide, with three in four democrats backing the proposal and nearly six in 10 independents on board as well, but only four in 10 republicans supporting ""cap and trade."" ""independents believe in global warming and believe that the government can take steps to curtail the problem,"" holland said. ""but the environment is not a big priority for independents, as it is with democrats."" the cnn/opinion research corp. poll was conducted october 16-18, with 1,038 adult americans questioned by telephone. the survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. cnn deputy political director paul steinhauser contributed to this report.",senate environment and public works committee debates act to cut greenhouse gases
"six world powers and iran have reached a deal on the framework for comprehensive negotiations over tehran's nuclear program, eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton said thursday. ""we have identified all of the issues we need to address in reaching a comprehensive and final agreement,"" ashton said, speaking alongside iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif, in vienna, austria. ""there is a lot to do. it won't be easy, but we've made a good start"" following ""three very productive days"" of talks, ashton added. in addition to political discussions, the two sides have started technical work, ashton said, and have set a timetable for meetings over the next four months, with a framework for further deliberations. technical experts will meet in early march, she said, and the next round of talks between the so-called p5+1 -- the united states, china, russia, britain, france and germany -- and iran will start march 17. zarif then delivered the same statement in persian. the latest talks began tuesday. u.s. state department spokeswoman marie harf said wednesday the meetings had been ""constructive and useful."" interim deal the latest talks come after an interim deal was forged in november, under which iran agreed to roll back parts of its nuclear program in return for relief from some sanctions. that agreement came into effect in january. the challenge now is to reach a permanent deal acceptable to all sides. the united states and its allies believe iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon, while tehran has said its atomic efforts are peaceful. wendy sherman, a senior state department official and lead negotiator for the united states on the interim deal, told cnn's wolf blitzer from vienna this week that any final agreement will be contingent on iran taking ""concrete"" verifiable steps that prevent it from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon. deputy foreign minister abbas araqchi insisted tuesday that the ""halting of iran's (nuclear) program and dismantling iran's nuclear facilities are not on the agenda,"" the semi-official mehr news agency reported. harf said specific issues such as dismantlement would be on the table in later discussions. ""we know both sides come to the negotiating table with certain positions in mind, clearly, but we do think that we have made some progress over these last few days and, hopefully, can continue to build on that going forward,"" she told reporters in washington.","""we have identified all of the issues we need to address"" for final deal, says ashton"
"photos that allegedly show the syrian regime committing mass torture are ""fake,"" syria's justice ministry said wednesday. in a statement on the state news agency sana, the justice ministry categorically denied allegations published in a new report accusing the regime of torturing and killing thousands of detainees in government custody. the statement branded the report ""politicized and lacking in objectivity and professionalism"" and said some of the photos are of ""foreign terrorists."" it then said any expert ""could easily find out that these pictures are fake and that they have no relation to prisoners or detainees in syrian prisons."" the report, first released by cnn on monday, was authored by a team of international legal and forensic experts based on thousands of photographs provided by a syrian defector. he claimed to have worked as a photographer at a military hospital that received dead bodies from detention centers. the justice ministry's response is the first official syrian government reaction to the report, which emerged on the eve of an international peace talks in switzerland. the images purportedly show ""systematic torture and killing"" of detainees by the al-assad regime. could photos be a game changer? that assertion is being made by a team of internationally recognized war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts, who analyzed thousands of digital photos taken and provided by a syrian defector codenamed ""caesar,"" who, along with his family, is now living outside syria in an undisclosed location. lifeless bodies, signs of starvation in the photos, lifeless bodies show signs of starvation, brutal beatings, strangulation and other forms of torture and killing, according to the report. the experts' report was partly sponsored by the government of qatar, which funded the british law firm carter-ruck to write it. qatar and saudi arabia provide most of the outside support for syria's rebel forces. the syrian justice ministry accused carter-ruck of a lack of professionalism and said it was ""known to have direct ties with countries that are hostile to the syrian arab republic since the start of the crisis."" aside from the photos of ""foreign terrorists,"" other individuals shown are ""civilians and military personnel who were killed as a result of torture by armed terrorist groups because they were accused of being pro-state,"" it claims. the ministry questions the credibility of the photographer, saying he was ""a fugitive who fled syria and who was already facing legal action,"" and asks how he would have got the necessary documents to leave the country. it also suggests that the timing of the publication of the photographs reveals their ""true purpose"" -- that of undermining the peace talks starting in montreux wednesday and moving to geneva at the end of the week. the report ""aims to undermine the efforts to bring peace in syria and put an end to the international sponsored terrorism in the country,"" the statement said.","syrian justice ministry says photos are ""fake"" and have no relation to government detainees"
"-- instead of contractions, they're called surges. and don't call it labor, it's birthing. when the discomfort of childbirth kicks in, it's pressure -- not pain. the philosophy behind hypnobirthing is to remove the fear of giving birth, its practitioners say. they believe that by training themselves to calm their body and mind to a state of self-hypnosis, they can reduce pain and discomfort. it's another trend in birthing that gives women the opportunity to prepare for childbirth such as lamaze classes, yoga and the bradley method. while it's unclear how many women deliver babies using hypnobirthing, it's institute says there are about 1,400 practitioners in the united states who train pregnant women to use the methods. moms who've taken hypnobirthing classes give birth at hospitals. some choose to get pain medication, epidurals or cesarean sections. others elect to give birth at home. the point of hypnobirthing is that giving birth is natural and can be done with less anxiety, its practitioners say. it does not promise pain-free childbirth. ""the difference is that we're saying let us teach you what happens within the body,"" said marie mongan, a hypnotherapist who founded the hypnobirthing institute. ""what we're doing is educating them about what is happening within the body."" august is typically the busiest month for childbirths, according to centers for disease control and prevention data. a handful of hospitals such as the cleveland clinic and dartmouth-hitchcock medical center offer hypnobirthing training. these classes are usually offered along with a variety of other childbirth preparation courses. mongan said hypnobirthing's popularity has increased mostly because of word of mouth among moms and pregnant hollywood celebrities. actresses such as jessica alba and tiffani thiessen, and model miranda kerr have talked about the pre-birthing techniques that rely on deep relaxation. ""there are ever so many more practitioners who want to become involved at this point,"" said mongan. ""we're 100 over where we were last year in people coming in wanting to teach hypnobirthing. it seems to be everywhere. we're getting a lot more media interest, celebrity interest."" the 'easy' childbirth: one mom's story unlike the stereotype, in hypnobirthing, nobody swings a pocket watch back and forth to lull a mother to sleep during labor. the mothers stay awake during the process, but train themselves to calm down so they may appear as if they're sleeping. some use instrumental music, rhythms and affirmations. they are encouraged to visualize a relaxed place or a goal like cuddling with their newborn. ""it's like a self-hypnosis,"" said joyce poplar, a perinatal educator who teaches at cleveland clinic's hillcrest hospital. ""they're in a deep, relaxed, limp state. every single woman is imagining something different -- whether it's a place in their mind, an outdoor place such as a beach scene. it's feeling it, being aware of it and having a sensory perception on that beach scene, smelling the salt in the air, hearing the seagulls. they're completely there in a trance-like state."" they also learn breathing techniques. ""the body knows how to birth the baby, just like it knew how to grow that baby for nine months,"" poplar said. ""i'm teaching the moms the skills to listen to their bodies and the power of the uterus to do the work."" hypnobirth instructors say the methods reduce pain that stems from apprehension and anxiety about giving birth. ""we really focus on relaxation, releasing all the fears that moms have when they're having birth,"" poplar said. ""we're getting rid of the fears, memories, experiences, or the mistaken belief they might have had, so they can move forward with natural childbirth."" melanie johnson of hudson, ohio, had heard plenty of horror stories about labor. ""everyone wants to inflate the negativity of birth, comparing who had it the worst,"" she said. that's why hypnobirthers use a different vocabulary. but does changing some words and teaching relaxation techniques really result in a different type of labor? the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists referred cnn.com to the american society of anesthesiologists. dr. craig m. palmer, the society's chair of the committee on obstetrical anesthesia, said he wasn't familiar with hypnobirthing, but noted it could be a useful technique. ""any sort of childbirth prep that a mother will undergo is useful from a medical and anesthesiologist's point,"" said palmer, a professor of anesthesiology at the university of arizona health sciences center in tucson, arizona. ""the more prepared you are for labor, the more positive your outcome. as an anesthesiologist, any technique that improves patients' mental focus and state of mind is a good thing."" when amber diez, a mother of four from pembroke pines, florida, was pregnant with her first child, she was told by her instructor, ""this is going to be the worst pain in your life."" it turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. ""it was the worst pain in my life,"" said diez, who was in labor for 12 hours. ""i was scared and nervous."" for her second pregnancy, she carried twins and dreaded childbirth. so her doula gave her hypnobirthing cds. at first, diez scoffed at what she called, ""weird-sounding, hippie stuff."" her family poked fun at the cds and pretended to fall fast asleep from hypnosis. diez listened to the cds every night for a few weeks. when she went into labor for her twins, she found herself relaxed. ""when you're not scared of it, you're able to focus on your body to do what it's made to do,"" diez said. ""when you're not afraid, you don't experience as much pain as someone else would."" women who have tried hypnobirthing say there is pain, but it wasn't unbearable. ""at the end of labor, right before they're about to come out, i did experience pain,"" diez said. ""it was right at the end. i felt like i trusted my body."" johnson took hypnobirthing courses because she wanted to give birth without drugs. when she felt the contractions, she serenely listened to bach and beethoven on her ipod and focused on her breathing techniques. every time she felt a contraction she focused on her breathing. ""i visualized the goal on a surge-by-surge basis,"" johnson said. ""you're visualizing what you've got to do to get through the surge."" when she screamed ""ow,"" her doula coaxed her into a rhythmic ohm. ""i did feel pain, but it wasn't intolerable,"" johnson said. ""i knew if i could get through this one, i could get through the next one. i could restore energy between each surge."" after 14 hours of labor at home and eight hours at the hospital, johnson gave birth to a healthy baby girl, elise. ""it wasn't easy by any stretch,"" she said. ""they don't say there is no pain. the pain is going to be different for every woman. hypnobirthing doesn't say you don't have pain. it gets you in a mode where you can endure it.""",hypnobirth trains moms to calm body and mind to a state of self-hypnosis
"-- in a race to beat the flu season, medical institutes across the united states will begin human trials for a new h1n1 flu vaccine starting in early august, the national institutes of health announced wednesday. concern about the h1n1 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year. in the hope of getting the vaccine to those who will need it most by october, the clinical trials will enroll as many as 1,000 adults and children at 10 centers nationwide, said officials at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, a division of the nih, which will lead the effort. the trials will measure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. the research is a first step toward u.s. health officials' goal of developing a safe and effective vaccine against h1n1, also known as swine flu, which has been declared a global pandemic by the world health organization the time frame for developing a vaccine is a tight one. ""it's going to be close,"" said dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institutes of health. ""i believe it can be [ready by october] if things run smoothly. we hope they will, but you never can tell when you're dealing with biological phenomena like making vaccines and administering them."" the announcement of the u.s. trials followed the announcement earlier this week, by an australian company, csl ltd., of the first human trials of a swine flu vaccine. concern about the h1n1 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year. ""this virus has the potential to cause significant illness with hospitalizations and deaths during the u.s. flu season this fall and winter,"" said dr. karen kotloff, professor of pediatrics and lead investigator and researcher at maryland's center for vaccine development. ""vaccines have always been a vital tool for controlling influenza. the results of these studies will help to guide the optimal use of the h1n1 vaccines in the u.s. and elsewhere in the world."" after careful screening, volunteers will be inoculated and then asked to keep a diary on how they feel. after eight days their blood will be checked and after 21 days they will receive another dose, followed again by diary logs and blood tests. patients will be monitored two months for safety issues, followed by a four-month and six-month checkup. ""the purpose of these trials is always to make sure they are safe,"" kotloff said. ""but even after six weeks, if things look good, we're pretty sure the vaccine will work."" she noted the response to the vaccine may vary in different age groups. ""this is because young people have not seen a flu virus like this one before,"" she noted. ""older adults might have some immunity to the new h1n1 virus as a result of being exposed to similar flu viruses in the past. as a result, older adults might need fewer doses or a lower strength of the vaccine than younger individuals."" the vaccine at this point has been tested only in animals, where it has shown to be effective. further trials will examine questions such as how the vaccine works in combination with the seasonal flu vaccine and whether including an adjutant, a substance that boosts the immune response to vaccines, can make it work better at lower doses. other trial sites along with the university of maryland medical center are baylor college of medicine, cincinnati children's hospital medical center, emory university, saint louis university, seattle group health cooperative, the university of iowa, and vanderbilt university. they will be joined by children's mercy hospital and duke university medical center. cnn's valerie willingham and matt cherry contributed to this report.","human trials for h1n1 flu vaccine start august, says university of maryland"

"as russian president vladimir putin opens the winter olympics in sochi on february 7, there will be relief hidden behind his characteristically guarded smile. for putin, the past two years have witnessed a remarkable recovery. two years ago, putin seemed to be on the ropes. tens of thousands of muscovites were flooding central squares to protest a parliamentary election they said had been tarnished by massive fraud. his approval ratings were in free fall, having dropped 15 points since december 2010, according to polls from moscow's levada center. internationally, putin was also on the defensive. he appeared to have isolated himself by backing the wrong horse in syria's civil war. as rebels closed in on the damascus suburbs, many observers thought syrian president bashar al-assad, whom putin supported, would soon be swept from power. if so, russia stood to lose its only mediterranean military outpost, the naval station it leased at tartus. the european union, alarmed at the continent's dependence on russian gas, had raided offices of the russian company gazprom in germany and the czech republic and was planning further investigations. when built, a projected eu- and u.s.-supported nabucco pipeline threatened to pump gas from azerbaijan to vienna, undercutting russian supplies. not since the height of the global financial crisis had putin seemed so embattled. today, things look quite different. over the following year, the moscow protests died away. putin's ratings stabilized in the low 60s, a level many western leaders would envy. with a mixture of new repressive laws, prosecutions and co-optation tactics, the kremlin managed to box in and divide its domestic critics. so confident did putin feel by mid-2013 that he could, without losing sleep, allow the opposition activist alexei navalny to run for mayor of moscow (he lost, though with an impressive 27%) and pardon his nemesis, the imprisoned former oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky, allowing him to leave for switzerland. putin's star has also risen on the international stage. in september, he persuaded al-assad to pledge to give up his chemical weapons, saving president barack obama from a military intervention the u.s. leader clearly dreaded. al-assad looks more secure today than he has since protests against his rule began. by granting asylum to the nsa leaker edward snowden, putin managed -- ironically, given russia's own record of secrecy and spying -- to place himself on the side of a global movement for greater transparency and respect for citizens' privacy. one example: the new york times, in a recent editorial, called snowden's revelations ""a great service"" and urged obama to end snowden's vilification and offer him ""a plea bargain or some form of clemency."" in a showdown with the eu over the future of ukraine in november, putin again came out on top, persuading ukrainian president viktor yanukovych to reject a trade deal with europe to which brussels had committed its prestige. instead, yanukovych pledged to deepen his country's trade ties with russia, prompting furious protests from pro-europe ukrainians. as for gazprom, its sales of gas to europe rose by 16% in 2013 to a record high. the nabucco pipeline failed to line up committed gas supplies. according to one of the consortium's partners, as of june the project was ""over."" most of these successes are temporary, and time is not on the kremlin's side. fighting continues to rage in syria, and the destruction of al-assad's chemical weapons has been painfully slow. ukraine will sooner or later integrate with europe. yanukovych is struggling to stay in power as violence flares nightly in central kiev. gazprom's buoyant sales reflected an unusually cold winter in europe. at home, the frustrations that fueled the demonstrations two years ago have not gone away, just lost a focus. a major economic deterioration could prompt a new, potentially more consequential wave of protests. russia's growth rate has been falling steadily, reaching just 1.4% by the end of 2013, the lowest rate of putin's years as president. and the kremlin has no serious strategy to restart the economic engines. for now, putin still has reason to feel confident. even sochi, which could have turned into a political disaster, might well pass off positively for the kremlin. the advance bad press has lowered expectations so much that the games will seem something of a success if they merely take place without the stadium collapsing or terrorists exploding bombs in sochi itself. the de facto boycott by western leaders over russian intolerance toward gays will probably buy putin a little support at home since most russians share his discomfort with ""nontraditional lifestyles"" and do not like outsiders telling them what to do. in a recent poll, 73% agreed the state should ban public displays of homosexuality. what explains this turnaround? putin has benefited more from luck than skill. even without new repressive measures, the wave of demonstrations was bound to subside, following the natural ebb and flow of protest movements. those that climax without producing leader turnover tend to lose momentum, though some might reignite months or years later. in international affairs, putin profited from the mistakes of the west. obama, having backed himself into a corner with talk of ""red lines"" and facing a humiliating veto in congress, had to smile and accept help on syria from the leader he had recently taunted for his ""slouch."" the european union overplayed its hand in ukraine, insisting on terms that yanukovich thought would damage him politically. putin, offering a bailout with fewer visible strings attached, walked away with the ukrainian leader's agreement. one may debate whether the real mistake in the snowden case was the extent of u.s. spying or the lax security that allowed snowden to expose it. either way, it was a u.s. blunder, which landed unexpectedly in putin's lap. at some point, putin's luck is bound to run out. both at home and abroad, political challenges loom in 2014. still, as he prepares to greet and congratulate the olympic athletes, russia's president is on a roll.","two years ago, vladimir putin was in trouble, with widespread protests and falling ratings"
"-- as a child, i thought growing up in a slum near a dumpsite in the philippines was as normal a life as an ordinary kid can have -- until i mingled with people from different social classes. the feeling of being unwanted tore my heart out, and i grew to feel so sorry for myself. i was looked down upon and discriminated against because of my appearance in cheap secondhand clothes and old shoes. i wore the same pair of shoes for more than 10 years, lining the sole with a plastic bag so the water wouldn't seep into my feet. because of the way i looked, i was often bullied by gang members verbally and at times physically, with others hitting and shoving me. i felt different, powerless and socially isolated. watch a preview of the 2010 cnn heroes all-star tribute i was then focused on one thing: revenge! i kept those feelings to myself and it consumed me little by little, until my heart grew cold and i wanted to give up everything. i almost quit school because i was afraid. i thought of joining a gang to strike back at the bullies. i was lost, troubled and crying my heart out but nobody heard, no one seemed to care. i got so lost that i couldn't even find my way back to peace and happiness until god answered the desire of my heart. i was 13 when i met a man who became my friend, mentor, teacher and somewhat like a father. he helped me pick up the broken pieces of my life, which eventually healed my broken spirit. that mentor guided me and helped me change my perspective about a lot of things. he taught me that the quality of life is more dependent on our perspective than our circumstances, that the value of being is more dependent on our character than on our achievements -- and that the worth of our existence is more dependent on how we live life than on how long we survive. my mentor taught me that if i struck back with revenge against those who harmed and threatened me, it would just worsen my situation. so he introduced me to several volunteer activities, from distributing sandwiches to prisoners to building houses for less fortunate families to working in youth empowerment programs. i felt good about what i did, especially when people appreciated those small efforts. during those moments, i discovered my responsibility to other people and i slowly developed a heart that has a desire to help and reach out to those who are being bullied and discriminated against. my mentor encouraged me to think of a positive way to get back at those who bullied and put me down, not by violence but by competition. at 16, he helped me and my friends create dynamic teen company as an alternative club for students on campus and in communities, a way to stop bullies and school gangsters from victimizing and terrorizing more students. our main purpose is the exact opposite of that of the bullies and gang groups -- to care, show love and acceptance by making a small yet significant difference in school, in our family, toward our friends and the people around us, and to use our time, skills, talents, strength and energy in more productive activities. our goal was to show that that there is strength in numbers and that goodness should triumph over wrongdoing. our crusade against the acts of bullies and gang groups has reached the slums and depressed areas in our town, where many kids are groomed and trained as early as 9 years old to become a gangster. we were able to save children from this fate and help them become an asset to build a better community. we put an emphasis on using education and faith to help every child to have a better and decent life. this has become our mission. there are plenty of kids all over the world who are going through the same things as i did. and, even though we may feel helpless sometimes, there are a lot of things we and others can do to help stop bullying and gang violence. the role of adults, parents and mentors makes a big difference in combating this issue. children must be loved, protected and given proper guidance. good old family values should be strengthened. education and learning is not the sole responsibility of the school, but a concern of the family and society as well. love for learning will open new doors of opportunities to everyone. we should remember that all adults are in some ways teachers to children who watch us and copy our beliefs, acts and lifestyle. we want to create an environment where children can express themselves in a conduct that is loving, accepting and respecting of others, so that they may grow up to be assets and not liabilities to society. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of efren peñaflorida.",efren peñaflorida: i was bullied as a child in the philippines
"-- a vietnamese man is recovering in the intensive care unit friday, a day after surgery that completely removed from his right leg a tumor twice his body weight, according to the hospital in ho chi minh city. the growing tumor had rendered the patient, nguyen duy hai, virtually immobile until his surgery. the excised tumor weighed 180 pounds (82 kilos), according to the hospital, a bit less than the 200 pounds (90 kilos) estimated before surgery. hai, 31, of da lat city, has von recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis, said dr. jean-marcel guillon, chief executive officer of fv hospital, where the 12-hour procedure was performed. the autosomal dominant hereditary disorder is the same disease that contributed to the extraordinarily large head of joseph merrick, whose story was dramatized in the 1980 film, ""the elephant man,"" explained guillon. (last july, according to the u.s. national institutes of health, its researchers identified the gene variant in proteus syndrome and plan to test dna from merrick's skeleton to determine if proteus caused his disfigurement.) the tumor, which originated in hai's spine, ""may return,"" guillon wrote in e-mails to cnn, ""but we can operate him again, and it won't never reach such a size anymore."" doctors expect that hai's cardiac and pulmonary functions will return to normal during the next 10 days. after that, hai faces rehabilitation, physical therapy and possible help from the hospital's clinical psychologist to deal with issues pertaining to body image, guillon said. ""this patient lived all his life with this tumor. it was part of him."" hai also needs to learn how to do things that his body had forgotten, including using the left leg he had never used normally, guillon added. the tumor was first discovered when hai was four years old and had grown to its enormous size since then. hai had undergone a surgery to amputate most of his leg -- and with it the tumor -- in 1997, but in 2001, the tumor grew, and no doctors agreed to operate on him, according to the hospital. guillon said he did not know why the leg was amputated, as there are no medical records from that time. furthermore, his family could not afford surgery, and very few surgeons in vietnam can treat neurofibromas, guillon said. the latest surgery was considered risky with a 50% success rate for a number of reasons, guillon explained. ""first, such a giant tumor has developed its own blood system with huge arteries branched out from the normal vascular system. therefore, one of the main risks was abundant bleeding."" doctors used a ""cell saver,"" which suctions and filters the patient's blood before re-injecting it into the body, along with extra blood for the surgery. the second and third risks lay in heart function (""how would a heart react when a tumor with twice the weight of a patient is removed?"") and the effects of a long -- more than 13 hours -- anesthesia, guillon said. leading the surgical team was dr. mckay mckinnon, a specialist in plastic and reconstructive surgery from chicago. mckinnon has been credited with removing a 200-pound tumor from a woman in the u.s. state of michigan in 2000, as well as a 176-pound (80 kilo) tumor from a romanian woman in 2004. aside from mckinnon, no one else on the team had any prior experience with hai's condition or performed such a surgery before, guillon said. ""though the surgical techniques used by dr. mckinnon are usual and routinely used by our surgeons, the difference lays in his experience: he knows what to expect and what to do at specific crucial moments."" finally, the team of vietnamese surgeons and anesthetists had never worked with mckinnon before, and communication issues could turn dangerous in an operating theatre, guillon said, adding that two of the three vietnamese surgeons also go by ""dr. thai."" nonetheless, the communication among all in the operating theatre went ""extremely well,"" guillon said. during the surgery, fv hospital set up a live video feed for other doctors and hospitals to watch. video during the surgery showed five people assisting in the disposal of the excised tumor from its own gurney into a yellow container, which was then sealed. a small piece has been sent for examination; the rest will be incinerated as with all biological waste, guillon said. the cost of the surgery was estimated at $20,000, but the hospital said it will charge 60% of the cost, which will be covered jointly by the red cross of da lat city and sponsors. the hospital said it is financing all the traveling costs and accommodation for mckinnon, who is performing the surgery free of charge.","new: excised tumor weighed 180 pounds, hospital says"
"-- pounding his fist on the witness stand thursday, real-estate developer richard buccheri, 73, described the day he came face-to-face with boston's alleged irish mob kingpin james ""whitey"" bulger. bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades. he also faces charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. he had called buccheri to a meeting to discuss the positioning of a fence on a property bulger associate kevin weeks wanted to buy, buccheri said. he said they had barely sat down when bulger banged on the table and told buccheri, ""you know rich, sometimes you should just keep your mouth shut. you know kevin weeks is like a surrogate son."" buccheri's opinion on the positioning of the fence was not favorable to weeks. raising two fingers to his mouth to demonstrate, buccheri said bulger ""takes a shotgun off the table and sticks it in my mouth. then he took it out, punched me in the shoulder and said, 'richard you're a stand-up guy. i'm not going to kill you."" but then, he said, bulger ""puts a 45 to my head"" and demands $200,000 in 30 days, ""threatening to kill me and my family."" buccheri said he cut a check for the 200-grand, which bulger's henchman, steve flemmi cashed days later. buccheri said he had to give a braintree bank teller verbal permission to cash the gargantuan check. flemmi finished up his six days of testimony thursday. he described a decades-long journey that included extortion, meetings with fbi agents and slayings. flemmi testified he was by bulger's side for most of it, saying both were fbi informants. he described hundreds of occasions when he and bulger met with fbi agents. the defense suggested wednesday that flemmi would say anything to sweeten his deal with prosecutors and possibly get out of prison, even though the government has never raised that as a possibility. flemmi was arrested in 1995, was found guilty and was sentenced in 2001 to 10 years in prison for extortion and money laundering. in 2003 he pleaded guilty 10 murders and was sentenced to life in prison. bulger attorney hank brennan asked flemmi whether he hoped to get out of prison one day, and flemmi said, ""i'm still alive. there's always hope."" brennan also highlighted flemmi's relatively comfortable living conditions. ""it's like the club med of federal facilities,"" he said. ""you really think so?"" flemmi responded, apparently incredulous, about the undisclosed prison. brennan also asked about an apparent delicatessen on the premises serving salmon, steak, and smoked oysters. flemmi denied such a place exists, saying, ""if i fed some of that food to my dog, he'd bite me."" he then complained about the july fourth prison meal saying disgustedly, ""the hotdogs were burned. the hamburgers were burned."" flemmi was spared the death penalty on the 10 murder charge after agreeing to testify against bulger and his disgraced fbi informant handler, john connolly. authorities say connolly accepted thousands of dollars from bulger and his crew in payoffs and, in turn, tipped them off to law enforcement activity. connolly was convicted of federal and state crimes and is serving 40 years in florida. under flemmi's plea deal, the government allowed him to keep numerous properties including a home, at least four condos and a coin laundry. despite connolly's conviction and flemmi's testimony, bulger's lawyers have argued in this trial that he was not an fbi informant. authorities say connolly, who was raised in the same housing projects as bulger, cut a deal with the alleged mob figure in 1975. bulger would give information about the italian mob -- the fbi's prime target -- while bulger, authorities said, got names of rival gang members and other informants who had dirt on him. he is accused of killing those people. without that fbi protection, prosecutors say, bulger and flemmi's reign of terror would not have been as successful or lasted as long as it did, from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s. bulger rose to the top of the notorious winter hill gang, prosecutors say, before he went into hiding for more than 16 years after the crooked fbi agent told him in december 1994 he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. he was captured in santa monica, california, two years ago, living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city. the girlfriend, catherine greig, was sentenced to eight years in prison last summer for helping him evade capture. at his arraignment in july 2011 he pleaded not guilty to the 19 murder charges and 13 other counts. through his lawyers, the 83-year-old defendant had argued he was given immunity by the fbi and a former prosecutor. the judge dismissed the claim, saying any purported immunity was not a defense against crimes bulger faces. prosecutors plan to call two more witness friday, and expect to rest their case on the 30th day of trial. the defenses amended witness list, which was cut virtually in half to 32 witnesses last week, was whittled down to a potential 16 witnesses after judge denise casper ruled some witnesses irrelevant and the defense withdrew a handful. the list is subject to further change. among those virtually certain to testify are four fbi agents who the defense says will testify bulger was not an informant for fbi in boston. the government argued that bulger is not ""charged"" with being an informant and the testimony could confuse jurors. but casper said that, ""given the centrality of the government's allegation of bulger being an informant to all of the matters in this case, i think those are proper witnesses."" also on the stand thursday afternoon was bar owner kevin o'neil, one of the o's in ""triple o's bar,"" an establishment that doubled as one of bulger's many headquarters in the 1970s and '80s. o'neil said he had bulger on the payroll, but he was never an employee. when prosecuting attorney zachary hafer asked why he was on the payroll, o'neil responded, ""he asked."" hafer: ""why didn't you say 'no'""? o'neil: ""i didn't think it was smart."" o'neil testified that in christmas of 1994 he got a call from connolly, who said, ""get ahold of the kid because his friend has a problem."" in rapid-fire questioning, hafer asked, the kid?--""kevin weeks""; the friend?--""jim bulger""; the problem? --""i believe indictments."" o'neil testified that he then saw connolly talking to weeks shortly after that call. o'neil said he never saw bulger again after that day. prosecutors say connolly tipped bulger off to a 1995 indictment, causing bulger to go on the run, landing himself on the fbi's top 10 most wanted list before being arrested in california. besides the slayings, bulger is accused of using violence, force and threats to shake down south boston's bookmakers, loan sharks and drug dealers. the irish mob allegedly laundered its ill-gotten gains though liquor stores, bars and other property it owned in south boston. cnn's gary carter contributed to this report.","real-estate developer richard buccheri says ""whitey"" bulger put a gun to his head"
"-- standing slightly more than 4 feet tall, 9-year-old tuguldur proudly stated the greatest challenge he faced in a horse race across the mongolian plains in the country's annual naadam festival was serenading his horse. young wrestlers cheer on teammates during the opening round at the naadam festival. ""the hardest part of the race was singing to my horse while riding,"" said tuguldur, wiping perspiration from the july sun off his face. the long-distance horse race is exclusively for children, ranging in ages from 6 to 12. riding up to 30 kilometers (19 miles), these children maneuver their galloping steeds on a thin saddle pad that often does not have stirrups. ""mongolians believe they can communicate with their horses through singing, and their horse will go faster,"" said tamir, a senior at mongolian university. ""this is why the kids must keep singing during the race."" singing to racing horses is just one part of mongolia's naadam festival, an annual event believed to have existed for centuries, and rivaling the olympics as the premier sporting event in the central asian nation. ""for us mongolians, the naadam festival is what we look forward to all year,"" said dashtsogtsol erdenetuya, who has competed in the naadam festival for the past 22 years. ""it is our tradition and a reminder of an ancient way of life. getting gold in this festival brings as much honor as any olympic medal."" held every july, the naadam festival was possibly founded as long ago as 800 years ago by genghis khan. the festival is believed to have started as a way for mongols to train for military and hunting expeditions. today, it formally commemorates the 1921 revolution when mongolia declared itself a free country. many of naadam's customs, which include wearing traditional clothes and singing hymns once sung in battle, are still followed, a sign of the importance of the festival. ""in the naadam festival, everyone knows who you are; many companies will sponsor you, and if you win, you can become the face of the country,"" said nasanbat oyunbat, director of the mongolian olympic national team. ""the olympics are only now becoming popular in mongolia and were televised for the first time in the 2004 games in athens."" ""the horses in the naadam festival have higher endurance than the horses that will compete in the olympic equestrian events in august,"" bragged edward rochette, an american lawyer who married a mongolian woman and is living in ulaanbaatar. ""most thoroughbreds would die if you ran them for 30 km. the mongolian horses have been running across these plains for hundreds of years and have developed the correct body type for this kind of sport."" rochette's wife's family lives in a yurt (round animal skin tent), owns more than 1,500 and entered 20 horses in the three-day race competition this year, which was visited by thousands of tourists. ""i was overwhelmed watching the clouds of dust rise across the prairie as the horses galloped to the finish line,"" explained miep thulijls, a tourist from holland. ""i could not believe these tiny kids could ride for so long and was terrified when i saw one of the children fall off his horse like a rag doll."" the age limit was raised from 4 to 6 after a child was killed in a race a few years ago. only small children are allowed to compete in this event because they are particularly light. the kids are generally rewarded with warm mare's milk and candy while the horse owners get money and sometimes even cars. wrestling without weight limits mongolian wrestling has no weight divisions; a time limit was only introduced after a match went on for more than four hours. wrestlers compete in single elimination events and are weeded down from 512 participants during nine rounds of competition. ""it is more difficult to wrestle the little guys because they are so quick,"" complained gantogtokh, who at 130 kilos (286 pounds) is an eighth-generation wrestler. his father placed second in judo in the 1968 olympic games in mexico. dressed in tight blue shorts and a half shirt, which is usually red or blue, the wrestlers dance around the judges in slow graceful sways and then pay homage to the nine flags dating back to genghis khan before and after each match. it is rumored that the dress code, which requires wrestlers to compete without shirts was imposed after a female participated in the event disguised as a man. many of the male athletes who compete in the free style wrestling and judo events in the olympic games were once naadam festival winners. but, the olympic gold medal hopeful this year is a female judo wrestler. ""each generation of wrestlers gets stronger as they have more opportunities to work out,"" gantogtokh said. ""i hope this year we will bring home a gold in judo and wrestling. but, the competition is going to be tough."" arrows to anklebones other athletes participated in archery and anklebone shooting. ""this has always been my dream,"" beamed dashtsogtsol erdenetuya, 36, who has competed in the naadam festival for the past 22 years. ""i placed second the past three years and finally came in first this time. my mother was a champion in 1969 and 1975 and taught me everything i know about archery."" archery is usually the only event in which women compete. men shoot from 75 meters and women from 65 meters. mongolians sing to the archers and stand on either side of the targets. the singers, dressed in elaborate decor, sing three different types of songs, including an invitational song and songs that recognize a good or bad shot. famous for his ability to shoot backward on horseback, genghis khan created the sport of anklebone shooting to strengthen the middle finger of his soldiers, so they would be better skilled in archery. anklebone shooting is the newest event in the naadam festival, only becoming an official sport in 2000. ""the game is becoming more modern now,"" explained khatanbator, 56, an anklebone participant."" competitors now use pieces of deer antler instead of anklebones. it is easier on the wrist to flick than anklebones. but, everyone still refers to the sport as anklebone shooting because it has been this way for hundreds of years."" the competitors are divided into teams of eight who compete against each other. the first to knock all the deer chips down wins.

"-- western powers slapped sanctions on more than two dozen russian officials and their allies in ukraine's crimea region on monday, while ukrainian officials vowed they would never accept the territory's annexation by russia. in a televised address monday night, interim ukrainian president oleksandr turchynov said his government would do ""everything possible"" to solve the crisis diplomatically, and he praised his citizens for refusing to respond to russian provocations with violence. ""the kremlin is afraid of the democratic future which we are building, and this is the reason for their aggression,"" turchynov said. ""but this will not be an obstacle to the building of a democratic country."" but he announced a partial mobilization of his country's armed forces and said ukrainians ""have to unite in one big family, which is ready to protect its home."" prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk said there was ""a strong possibility"" of a russian invasion of ukraine. ""i still believe that there is only one solution of this crisis, a peaceful one,"" yatsenyuk said. ""but we offer peace, and russia offers war."" the russian-backed breakaway government in crimea applied to join with moscow on monday after a weekend referendum that ukraine, the united states and the european union called illegal. u.s. and eu officials announced sanctions on more than two dozen russian officials and their allies in the region, which russian-backed forces seized three weeks ago. in moscow, russian president vladimir putin signed a decree that recognizes the independence and sovereignty of the republic of crimea, says a statement on russia's kremlin website. the russian parliament is expected to vote on whether to annex the breakaway territory in the coming days. turchynov said ukraine was willing to hold talks with russia, ""but we will never accept the annexing of our territory."" the eu sanctions include the top pro-russian crimean secessionist leaders, 10 leading russian lawmakers who have endorsed the annexation of crimea and three top russian military commanders. the u.s. sanctions list also includes two top advisers to russian president vladimir putin and ex-ukrainian president yanukovych, whose february ouster in the face of widespread anti-government protests sparked the current crisis. in washington, president barack obama warned moscow: ""further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate russia and diminish its place in the world.""

"-- the united nations is calling on nato to do more to stop the afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates afghanistan's economy. afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in taliban-controlled helmand province in april 2007. the report from the u.n.'s office on drugs and crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. despite afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. the report said opium has accounted for more than half of afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. investorwords.com defines gdp as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. according to the u.n. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. the rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. antonio maria costa, executive director of the u.n. office on drugs and crime, urged nato to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the american-led invasion to remove the hard-line islamist government of the taliban in october 2001. ""since drugs are funding the insurgency, nato has a self-interest in supporting afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,"" costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. ""destroy the drug trade and you cut off the taliban's main funding source."" james appathurai, a nato spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. ""we share the u.n.'s concerns,"" appathurai told cnn. ""drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation."" he said nato forces were providing assistance to afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. ""the issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for nato, but at the moment this is a matter for the afghan government,"" appathurai said. farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, appathurai said. however, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the taliban stronghold of helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. according to the report, u.n. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. he called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between afghanistan and its neighbors. ""drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,"" the u.n. drug chief said. appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. he also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. ""you cannot have eradication in isolation. if we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,"" he said. e-mail to a friend",study finds opium makes up half of afghanistan's gross domestic product

"-- he lies in a bed on a balloon-type mattress, to reduce pressure on his burned body. he is covered with bandages; a ventilator breathes for michael brewer because he can't do it for himself. he's hooked up to the marvels of modern medicine that are trying to give the 15-year-old burn victim a chance to be a kid once again. sixty-five percent of his body is covered with second- and third-degree burns. ""people are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about,"" said dr. nicholas namias, medical director of the university of miami/jackson memorial hospital burn center in miami. ""i've been to movies like everyone else, and hollywood hasn't even thought of something like this,"" namias said. brewer is heavily sedated, and the ventilator does not allow him to speak. his open wounds are covered by bandages, which are changed daily. it's a four-hour process. he has not been able to speak with police since his desperate fight for life began october 12, when police say five teenage friends, including a 13-year-old, doused brewer with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire. the attack occurred after brewer reported to police that one of the youths had stolen his father's bicycle. police say the bicycle was stolen because brewer did not pay one of the boys $40 for a video game. according to police, witnesses said the teens called brewer ""a snitch"" as they used a lighter to set him ablaze. namias explained how brewer's organs are not functioning the way they should be, but that is expected at this early stage of recovery. ""he's still on the ventilator and advanced modes of mechanical ventilation. we are breathing for him. his contribution to the breathing is trivial,"" namias said. namias also explained that in burn cases, words must be chosen carefully when talking about patients and their condition because so much is at risk and so much can change quickly. ""when you say he's doing ok, in this situation it means he's alive and responding to treatments,"" namias said. ""we're still dealing with the respiratory failure. we're dealing with infection now and the need to supply the massive amount of nutrition that this person needs to survive."" on monday, the five teens who are accused of taking part in the attack appeared separately before judges in broward county, florida. state prosecutors were granted additional time to build their case. formal charges are expected later this month. for now, all five teens are being held in custody. four of the boys, all 15 years old, could be charged as adults. the 13-year-old also could be charged as an adult but under florida law only if brewer dies. michael brewer's parents, valerie and michael brewer sr., issued a written statement through the hospital last week. they are not granting interviews. ""the recovery process will be baby steps, but eventually he will be whole again,"" they wrote. but their son's injuries enter the realm of medicine and science that has no guarantee. ""there's no evolutionary mechanism to survive a 65 percent burn,"" namias said. ""surviving is a miracle of modern medicine and about the technology and the things we do. this is not like a gunshot and you come out of the [operating room], and say everything's going to be ok,"" he added. ""we never give up, and we never predict it. ... our expectation is survival."" across the hospital floor in the burn unit at jackson memorial hospital, six other people's lives also are at stake: all victims of various accidents, all with burns similar to michael brewer's. they, too, are trying to regain at least a part of what they used to have.

"-- a skydiver's historic free-fall from the stratosphere was called off tuesday due to wind gusts that ruined the helium balloon set to hoist him to high altitude for the record-breaking attempt. another attempt is not expected before thursday due to weather conditions. felix baumgartner is aiming to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet (about 23 miles), more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner -- with nothing but a space suit, helmet and parachute. he also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier in such a dive. at that altitude, the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds, he is expected to be free-falling faster than 690 miles an hour. organizers initially delayed the balloon launch tuesday morning because of gusting winds, then tried to make it happen a few hours later at the roswell launch site. however, as baumgartner waited in the capsule to be carried up to high altitude, another wind gust whipped the more than 500-foot-tall white balloon and ruined it for the mission. art thompson, the technical project director for the mission, said only one back-up balloon is now available to carry out the attempt. ""there's a lot riding on that, so the main thing for us is making sure the probability is very high,"" thompson said. asked how he felt about having to call off the attempt, thompson replied: ""deflated. no pun intended."" ""for felix, it's a lot of frustration,"" thompson added. ""a lot of anticipation getting to this point, and then feeling that he's going to have to wait -- it's a lot of anxiety on his part, i'm sure."" 'human helicopter' breaks record for world's longest flight years of preparation and untold costs to the primary sponsor, red bull, led to tuesday's scheduled attempt. when the launch occurs, baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent in a capsule hanging from the helium balloon. then he will climb out of the capsule, jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched ""delta"" position to maximize his speed. he plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes, then deploy a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to earth. the attempt has serious risks. he and his team have practiced how he can avoid getting trapped in a dangerous ""horizontal spin."" at temperatures that could hit 70 degrees below zero fahrenheit or lower, and an atmosphere so thin that his blood would vaporize if he were unprotected, his life will depend on the integrity of his pressure suit. if he loses consciousness during the five-minute plunge, he will survive only if his parachute deploys automatically. another unknown: the effects on the body of breaking the sound barrier. while reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft, planners for this jump believe there will be little effect on baumgartner because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air that shock waves are barely transmitted. ""i'm not nuts,"" baumgartner said when cnn first interviewed him about the project in 2010. ""you know, our records are meant to be broken, and i'm a very competitive person. i like the challenge."" on a more serious note, he added, ""of course i'm afraid of dying, because i worked so hard to reach this level. you know, i'm living a good life. i think the most important thing i'm doing is to come back alive."" baumgartner is an austrian helicopter pilot and former soldier who has base jumped from such landmarks as the petronas towers in malaysia and the christ the redeemer statue in rio de janeiro. base is an acronym for buildings, antennas, spans and earth -- the four things from which you can jump. he has been preparing for his latest feat for five years -- both physically and mentally. ""you have to remember all the procedures,"" he said in an interview during testing for the jump. ""you know you're in a really hostile environment. and you cannot think about anything else. you have to be focused. otherwise, you're gonna die."" the balloon being used is light and translucent. the material is only .0008 of an inch thick, and it will change shape and size as it rises. the pressurized helmet and suit, which restrict baumgartner's mobility and together weigh 100 pounds, have been equipped with sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate. cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt. baumgartner was not doing interviews leading up to the jump, but his performance coach, andy walshe, described him as mentally well-prepared. ""he knows that he's rehearsed it and knows what to do,"" walshe said sunday. ""we want him in the right state of mind. we ask him to reflect on what he's done, what he's been through and what he's achieving for himself personally, so he can relax and focus."" the record for such a jump is currently held by col. joe kittinger, who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a u.s. air force mission. more than 50 years later, kittinger is a consultant and mentor for baumgartner's effort. kittinger has also been giving baumgartner advice on what to expect. for example, he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air: ""there's no way you can tell how fast you're going, because there's no visual cues."" kittinger rejects any suggestion that he is jealous that baumgartner is poised to beat his record. ""oh no. i'm delighted,"" he told cnn recently. ""he's advancing science, and he'll do a great job.""","new: another attempt could happen this week, perhaps thursday"

"washington (cnn) -- william jackson was a slave in the home of confederate president jefferson davis during the civil war. it turns out he was also a spy for the union army, providing key secrets to the north about the confederacy. william jackson, a slave, listened closely to jefferson davis' conversations and leaked them to the north. jackson was davis' house servant and personal coachman. he learned high-level details about confederate battle plans and movements because davis saw him as a ""piece of furniture"" -- not a human, according to ken dagler, author of ""black dispatches,"" which explores espionage by america's slaves. ""because of his role as a menial servant, he simply was ignored,"" dagler said. ""so jefferson davis would hold conversations with military and confederate civilian officials in his presence."" dagler has written extensively on the issue for the cia's center for the study of intelligence . watch the stories of slaves as spies » in late 1861, jackson fled across enemy lines and was immediately debriefed by union soldiers. dagler said jackson provided information about supply routes and military strategy. ""in jackson's case, what he did was ... present some of the current issues that were affecting the confederacy that you could not read about in the local press that was being passed back and forth across local lines. he actually had some feel for the issues of supply problems,"" dagler said. jackson and other slaves' heroic efforts have been a forgotten legacy of the war -- lost amid the nation's racially charged past and the heaps of information about the war's historic battles. but historians over the last few decades have been taking an interest in the sacrifice of african-americans during those war years. jackson's espionage is mentioned in a letter from a general to secretary of war edwin stanton. maj. gen. irvin mcdowell refers to ""jeff davis' coachman"" as the source of information about confederate deployments. watch grandson of slaves: ""they call me little man"" » dagler said slaves who served as spies were able to collect incredibly detailed information, in large part because of their tradition of oral history. because southern laws prevented blacks from learning how to read and write, he said, the slave spies listened intently to minute details and memorized them. ""what the union officers found very quickly with those who crossed the line ... was that if you talked to them, they remembered a great more in the way of details and specifics than the average person ... because again they relied totally on their memory as opposed to any written records,"" he said. jackson wasn't the only spy. there were hundreds of them. in some cases, the slaves made it to the north, only to return to the south to risk being hanged. one union general wrote that he counted on black spies in tennessee because ""no white man had the pluck to do it."" no one was better than robert smalls, a slave who guided vital supply ships in and out of charleston harbor in south carolina. he eventually escaped and provided the union with ""a turning of the forces in charleston harbor,"" according to an annual report of the navy secretary to president lincoln. ""a debriefing of him gave ... the union force there the entire fortification scheme for the interior harbor,"" dagler said. one of the most iconic spies was harriet tubman, who ran the underground railroad, bringing slaves to the north. in 1863, she was asked by the union to help with espionage in south carolina. she picked former slaves from the region for an espionage ring and led many of the spy expeditions herself. ""the height of her intelligence involvement occurred late in 1863 when she actually led a raid into south carolina,"" dagler said. ""in addition to the destruction of millions of dollars of property, she brought out over 800 slaves back into freedom in the north."" as the nation marks black history month in february, dagler said that history should include the sacrifices of the african-americans who risked their lives for their nation. many paid the ultimate sacrifice.

"-- bayern munich produced a spirited fight back to knock 10-man manchester united out of europe's champions league and set up a semifinal against lyon. trailing 2-1 from the first leg, united raced into a 3-0 lead, but goals from ivica olic and arjen robben saw bayern progress on the away goals rule as the tie finished 4-4 on aggregate. english premier league champions united were in control until the sending-off of rafael da silva early in the second half handed bayern the initiative and robben's stunning volley was worthy of winning any match. united manager alex ferguson sprung a surprise before kick-off by naming wayne rooney in his starting line-up just eight days after the england striker twisted his ankle during the first leg. rooney landed awkwardly on the same ankle after 20 minutes and seemed to struggle for mobility before he was replaced after 55 minutes. it was one of ferguson's other surprise inclusions who opened the scoring. darron gibson, selected ahead of ryan giggs and paul scholes, picked up rooney's pass and fired a shot past the unsighted bayern goalkeeper hans-jorg butt. four minutes later, united were 2-0 ahead as antonio valencia crossed for nani to score with a sublime backheel. the german bundesliga leaders almost leveled the aggregate score when olic's shot was smothered by united goalkeeper edwin van der sar. moments later, united went 3-0 up as valencia's low cross was smashed into the roof of the net by nani. bayern were given a lifeline before half-time when croatian striker olic shrugged off michael carrick and fired past van der sar from a narrow angle. united were reduced to 10 men early in the second half when rafael received a second yellow card for a foul on franck ribery. nani and darren fletcher both went close for united before van der sar produced a fine reflex save to keep out ribery's effort. united seemed content to soak up bayern pressure but their resistance was broken by a moment of individual brilliance from robben. ribery's corner picked out the former chelsea winger on the edge of the area and his volley arrowed past van der sar and into the bottom corner. ferguson threw on dimitar berbatov and ryan giggs in pursuit of a winner but bayern kept possession with ease to see out a victory that went some way to avenging their defeat to united in the 1999 final. the defeat capped a miserable few days for united, who lost 2-1 to chelsea on saturday to fall two points behind the londoners in the race for the premier league title. ""the key thing was losing a goal just before half time and the young boy getting sent off,"" ferguson told itv1.

"-- who is the first person you call when the sports team you support is experiencing a dire run of results? in the case of one disgruntled manchester united his first port of call was to british police demanding to speak with the team's former manager alex ferguson. the drunken fan had seemingly had enough after manchester united, now managed by david moyes, were beaten on penalties by sunderland in the semifinals of the league cup -- england's second most prestigious cup competition. the desperate plea was revealed on wednesday by great manchester police (gmp), who advised against such calls being made to the emergency services. ""a man from the crumpsall area of north manchester rang 999 in a drunken state demanding to speak to sir alex ferguson about last night's result,"" read a gmp statement posted on its facebook page.

"-- within hours of speaking with the bbc and voice of america, both in persian, fariborz raisdana, a leading iranian economist, was arrested by the security forces of the islamic republic. on both these occasions, raisdana was severely critical of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad's program of substantially cutting governmental subsidies, in what amounts to ""the biggest surgery"" to the iranian economy in 50 years. initiated on sunday, the government's actions introduced a four-fold rise in the price of gasoline and seriously cut government food subsidies, including, literally, people's daily bread. the current 20% inflation rate, some economies believe, will in fact increase after these new ""austerity measures."" even economists sympathetic to ahmadinejad's policies warn of higher inflation and characterize his claim of ""zero inflation"" as disingenuous. a much milder version of a hike in the gasoline price resulted in widespread riots and the burning down of gas stations by protesters back in 2007, only two years into ahmadinejad's presidency. this time around ahmadinejad anticipated possible protests by ""flooding iran's capital"" with the militarized security forces, in a move similar to the government's response to the opposition green movement. the u.s.-led and u.n.-imposed sanctions against iran, aimed at stopping its nuclear program and supported by those wishing for ""regime change,"" obviously played a major role in increasing the pressure for cutting government spending. but among raisdana's comments to bbc and voa was the fact that such cuts in governmental subsidies and a turn to neoliberal economics was a policy favored by the last two presidents of iran, who have also been (to varied degrees) supporters of the green movement -- ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani and mohammad khatami. this creates a major rift within the opposition camp of the green movement. its leadership, particularly khatami, now needs to decide where they stand -- they can no longer oppose ahmadinejad for a program they were championing for decades -- but did not have the political will and/or military wherewithal to implement. by taking these steps and introducing a form of reaganomics to iran, ahmadinejad is exposing his own hypocrisy. he can no longer pose as the populist champion of the poor fighting against the presumably more affluent members of the green movement. he has also exposed as a fraud his global posturing as an anti-capitalist champion. some 7 million iranian laborers, and their families -- with their union leaders like mansur osanlou suffering in the dungeons of the islamic republic -- are set to suffer the consequences of these cuts in subsidies. ahmadinejad's neoliberal economics share another thing with president ronald reagan's policies. the iranian president is pushing an increase in military spending. that buildup is first and foremost prompted by the military threat that the u.s. and its regional allies have posed to the islamic republic for at least the last decade. such spending also supports the heavily militarized security apparatus of ahmadinejad's regime. it helps employ less-well-off iranians, making them beholden to the regime and enhances the power of the ""the military industrial complex"" that now rules the country from the headquarters of its paramilitary revolutionary guards. be that as it may, these same measures also expose the banality of ahmadinejad's alliance with such self-proclaimed champions of anti-capitalism as evo morales of bolivia and hugo chavez of venezuela. and it makes a mockery of what passes for ""progressive anti-war activists"" in the united states who fall head over toe trying to have dinner with ahmadinejad when he visits new york, in support of his ""anti-capitalist,"" and ""anti-imperialist"" positions. domestically, the move is a calculated risk for ahmadinejad, because it will undoubtedly compromise his populist propaganda, if not his claim to a popular base. still it may be a risk worth taking for ahmadinejad, since it could weaken the opposition. if this opposition wants a market-driven economy, here it is -- initiated by ahmadinejad's government. the ball is now squarely in mir hossein mousavi's court. the leader of the green movement must clearly and succinctly distinguish his economic philosophy from that of ahmadinejad and his predecessors, and reach out on behalf of the most vulnerable social classes of the society as they struggle with huge cost increases. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of hamid dabashi.","iran cut government food and fuel subsidies, leading to higher prices"

"-- the downing of a turkish jet over the mediterranean last friday by a syrian missile took turkish-syrian tensions to a new level. though the turkish government did not declare war as some expected, and others feared, it did declare syria a ""clear and present danger"" and raised its rules of engagement to an alert level. how we came to this point is an interesting story. the 550-mile long border with syria, turkey's longest, has often been tense. during the cold war, syria was a soviet ally, turkey was a nato member (as it still is) and the border was heavily mined. moreover, hafez assad, the father and predecessor of syria's current dictator, bashar al-assad, supported and hosted the pkk, the outlawed kurdistan workers party, which has led a guerrilla war against turkey since the early '80s. (pkk is defined by turkey and the united states as a terrorist group.) turkey had come close to waging a war against syria in 1999 because of this pkk connection. turkey moves forces to syrian border amid tensions, official says however, the relations surprisingly changed for the better in the first decade of the new century. bashar al-assad, who replaced his father in 2000, seemed to promise a more open and friendly syria. in turkey, the justice and development party of recep tayyip erdogan, which came to power in 2002, initiated a foreign policy of ""zero problems with neighbors."" this led to a fruitful turkish-syrian rapprochment: erdogan and assad became friends, trade between the two countries was boosted, and borders were opened for visa-free travel. just two years ago, the two countries looked like the core states of a would-be middle eastern union modeled after the eu. but this honeymoon came to an abrupt end with the arab spring. the erdogan government, whose claims include democratizing turkey by saving it from the tutelage of the country's overbearing military, intuitively sympathized with and announced support for this democratic wave in the region. yet while this proved to be a winning game in tunisia, egypt and libya, syria turned out to be a tougher case. throughout the initial months of the demonstrations in syria, which began in march 2011, the turkish government hoped and tried to persuade al-assad's regime to allow a peaceful transition to democracy. this hope was gradually replaced by frustration, however, and erdogan soon began to condemn the ""barbarism"" and ""savagery"" of the syrian regime. the trouble for him, as it usually is, was also personal: as he said in the turkish parliament on june 21, assad had promised him change and reform but proved to be a liar instead. consequently, turkey rapidly emerged as one of the boldest supporters of the syrian opposition, and the syrian national council, formed as the dissidents' umbrella group, found a base in turkey. meanwhile, at least 15,000 refugees from syria, both dissidents and their families, were given shelter on the turkish side of the syrian border. moreover, the free syrian army, a rebel group formed by the syrian soldiers who deserted to the opposition's side, not only operated from turkey but, according to some reports, were helped with arms and other supplies as well. the syrian response was to add turkey to its own version of the axis of evil -- the united states, nato, saudi arabia and in fact much of the rest of the world -- in its official propaganda. inside turkey, this engagement in the syrian crisis has supporters and critics. the supporters are mostly sunni conservatives who strongly identify with the syrian opposition, which include the syrian muslim brotherhood. (the massacre of thousands of sunnis in hama in 1982 by hafez assad had been a tragic memory in the minds of these conservative turks, who now believe that the syrian leopard has simply not changed its spots.) other voices in turkey, ranging from hardcore secularists to pro-iranian marginal islamists, accuse the government for being naively involved in a conflict cooked up by ""western imperialists."" the plane incident came on top of all this. the downed jet was apparently an unarmed but military aircraft which, according to the turkish government, was on a peaceful mission to test the nato radar system based in eastern turkey. syrians said the plane violated syrian airspace and was shot within it. the turkish government said the plane violated the syrian airspace ""mistakenly and very briefly"" but was hit by a syrian missile despite immediately having reverted to international airspace. the plane's two pilots, who apparently fell to the sea, are missing. the turkish reaction to the incident was outlined by erdogan in an address in the parliament that came four days after the incident. in a very strident tone against the ""bloody dictator of syria,"" erdogan announced that turkey now sees its southern neighbor as a ""clear and present danger"" and will change its rules of engagement: ""any military element that approaches the turkish border from syria by posing a security risk will be regarded as a threat, and will be treated as a military target."" the very same day, some turkish tanks on the syrian border were repositioned, implying that ankara meant business. yet almost no one in turkey seems enthusiastic for war. many here point out that turkey's ascendance in the past decade has been thanks to its ""soft power."" that mainly rested on the country's economic boom and democratic reforms, which seemed to present a synthesis of islam, free-market capitalism and political liberalism. photos: in syrian hospital, no escape from war but should turkey now consider putting some ""hard power"" on the table, without which it might become ineffective in its region? this is a question that turks are passionately discussing these days, and the answer seems to matter a lot for the syrians as well. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of mustafa akyol.",mustafa akyol: syria downing of turkish plane has brought countries' tensions to new level

"-- the suspected ringleader of a group arrested for allegedly luring a 15-year-old boy to a florida home, shooting him several times, burning his body in a fire pit and putting the remains into paint cans, could face the death penalty if convicted, his attorney said thursday. but defense attorney charles holloman added, ""we are not admitting any guilt at this time."" michael bargo, 18, appeared in court thursday where he was denied bond in the killing of seath jackson, an act that allegedly involved five other people sunday in the central florida city of ocala, according to a statement from the marion county sheriff's office. holloman said jackson and bargo had dated the same girl, though not at the same time. jackson at one point went to bargo's home yelling and screaming in the front yard, threatening to burn down bargo's house, holloman added. cnn cannot independently confirm that statement. prosecutors say two females later lured jackson to the home, where he was beaten with a wooden object. he was then shot several times with a .22 caliber gun, authorities said. as the wounded teen attempted to flee, he was tackled and shot again, according to the sheriff's statement. his body was allegedly placed in a sleeping bag and burned in a fire pit outside the home. his ashes were placed into several paint containers and thrown into a large garbage can, authorities said. authorities said they learned of the alleged plot from a member of the group who admitted witnessing the killing. four adults and two minors have been charged in connection with the death. bargo, charlie kay ely, 18; justin soto, 20, and two minors face first-degree murder charges, the marion county sheriff's office said. james haven, 37, faces charges of accessory to the crime for allegedly helping to dispose of jackson's remains and driving one of the suspects out of the area to avoid arrest, authorities said. sheriff's department documents gave little information on what led to the killing other than brief statements by suspects about a dispute and a growing hatred. divers on wednesday found three paint buckets in a water-filled rock quarry that are suspected of containing the victim's remains, authorities said. the contents of the buckets were delivered to a forensic specialist at the university of florida in gainesville to determine if the ashes and bone fragments match those of jackson. haven, who is not represented by an attorney, posted a $10,000 bond and was released wednesday morning. the two minors involved in the case are currently being represented by public defenders, who could not comment. a jury trial that was expected to take place on may 2 has been postponed, said holloman. soto's public defender, bill miller, would not comment on the case. ely is not represented by an attorney. bargo also had a restraining order issued against him, forbidding contact with a person named calib, who is not connected to the jackson case, holloman said.","new: michael bargo could face the death penalty if convicted, his attorney says"
"washington (cnn) -- terrorists increasingly favor using women as suicide bombers to thwart security and draw attention to their causes, a new fbi-department of homeland security assessment concludes. female suicide bombers can use devices to make them appear pregnant, a security assessment says. the assessment said the agencies ""have no specific, credible intelligence indicating that terrorist organizations intend to utilize female suicide bombers against targets in the homeland."" but it points out that women have been reported as attackers in the russian breakaway republic of chechnya and in india, iraq, pakistan, the palestinian territories, sri lanka and turkey. the notice was distributed monday to law enforcement officials throughout the united states, and cnn obtained a copy of it. officials want to make sure security officers are alert to the possibility of female bombers and to familiarize themselves with behavior patterns that such attackers have used in the past. ""even as military and security forces are paying more attention to the use of female operatives, terrorists are adapting their suicide attack tactics to compensate for enhanced security measures,"" the advisory said. watch how u.s. authorities profile terror suspects » the assessment highlighted the february 1 bombings in baghdad in which two women, who appeared to have down syndrome, attacked two pet markets. the attacks forced fbi and dhs officials to rethink a belief that those responsible for such incidents had the mental discipline ""to accomplish the operation."" the two agencies also echo what experts have said before -- that ""female suicide bombers may have an advantage over their male counterparts in accessing targets."" for example, the assessment points out women can hide explosives in prosthetic devices that mimic the look of pregnancy. e-mail to a friend",security agencies warn u.s. police departments about new tactics

"-- for ""coco avant chanel"" director anne fontaine, there was only one actress who could play coco chanel in her biopic about the legendary couturier -- french actress audrey tautou. in ""coco avant chanel,"" french actress audrey tautou plays coco chanel, founder of the iconic parisien haute couture house, chanel. already uncannily similar in looks, tautou's strong performance breathes life into gabrielle ""coco"" chanel, the fiery designer who would found iconic parisian haute couture house, chanel. from the way she holds her cigarette to coco's famously sharp gaze, tautou is a dead-ringer for the young coco. ""she is perfect for the part,"" fontaine told cnn. ""she has this determination and authority."" ""coco"" charts the couturier's early life -- an almost fairytale journey from orphaned cabaret performer in moulins to the 20th century's foremost fashion designer. fontaine, who also wrote the script for ""coco,"" says the film would have been impossible without tautou: ""for me, it was the beginning of the story to have a good interpretation of coco -- if not, i wouldn't have written the script."" but, while tautou's unmistakable similarity to coco chanel made her an obvious choice for the role, the striking actress says she wasn't interested in doing a ""birth to death"" biopic of the designer. ""it seemed to me that the period when coco was building herself and asserting her personality is the most interesting in her life,"" says tautou who rose to international prominence in quirky 2001 drama, ""amelie."" it was fontaine's vision that finally convinced the 32 year-old actress to take on the role: ""when anne explained how she intended to treat the subject, i immediately agreed,"" tautou told cnn. ""she knew she was predestined for this role,"" says fontaine. ""she has this 'little black bull' side to her, a grace, finesse, and an irrefutable charisma."" ""coco"" focuses on the years chanel spent living with wealthy socialite, etienne balsan. balsan, played brilliantly by benoit poelvoorde, introduces her to the parisian high society and fashion -- lavishness the wide-eyed chanel rapidly acclimatized to. ""chanel looked at everything. her culture was not one of knowledge, but a culture of observations,"" says fontaine. it was during this time coco's own style and creativity began to blossom -- partly in disgust at the unnecessary extravagance of upper-class style during the gaudy years of the late belle epoque in france. designers of the time projected their image of the ideal woman onto the corsets and elaborate hats they created for them to wear. coco rejected that ideal, opting to build a style based solely on herself, liberating the female body from the constricting style of the time. ""she's the beginning of the modern woman,"" said fontaine. unlike other recent film forays into the fashion world, ""coco before chanel"" is less about the clothes and accessories and more about the intellectual and philosophical evolution of one of fashion's greatest minds. ""coco"" stops short of telling the story of chanel's darker years in nazi-occupied paris during ww2, when she took up residence at the ritz hotel and was criticized for her affair with hans gunther von dincklage, a nazi officer. it is one of two films about the iconic couturier's early life this year. the other, ""coco chanel & igor stravinsky,"" a lavish, part-fact, part-fiction portrayal of chanel's brief affair with the avant garde composer directed by dutch-born jan kounen was the closing night film at this year's cannes film festival. highlights from the french film talent at this year's cannes film festival » fontaine also had to add an element of fiction to her telling of chanel's early years, taking liberties with the script to get some of chanel's most iconic designs into the film. the blue-striped mariner's sweater tautou wears in one scene didn't actually come into being until the 1930s, and the quilted sewing pouch, which in the film, prompts the idea for chanel's world-famous bag was not the true inspiration. fontaine also includes the death of chanel's great love, the british industrialist boy capel (played by alessandro nivola), which took place in the years after those shown in the film, because of the huge impact his death had on the designer. ""it was the most important love of her whole life,"" the 49 year-old luxembourg-born director told cnn. ""when he's dead, when he disappears, something breaks and she only has the work."" that chanel never married has been attributed to her heartbreak over capel's tragic death in a car accident. indeed, coco herself once said, ""i lost everything with the loss of capel."" tautou's portrayal of chanel's broken heart in the scenes around capel's death may be her finest. it is almost as if the actress becomes the young coco chanel. ""the portrayal was not in the costume, not in the superficial side of the character, but in [my] inner self,"" says tautou. ""in the last part [of the film], i was completely her."" fontaine and tautou both acknowledge the biggest challenge of making ""coco before chanel"" was doing justice to one of the most well-known and influential women of the 20th century. ""the most difficult thing when you speak about somebody who's so known, so legendary, is to be true to her,"" said fontaine.

"-- the year is 1969 and britain is at the peak of its counter-culture revolution -- a time of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. the beatles are putting together their final album while a relatively unknown musician, david bowie is making waves with his track ""space oddity."" meanwhile, in liverpool, a 15-year-old schoolgirl is headed for trouble. though academically gifted, jude kelly is bored at school and overcome with a mix of teenage angst and a vivid imagination. she's beginning to hang around with a rough crowd and soon finds herself in trouble with the law. but one person has taken notice of her downward spiral -- her high school principal. ""the headmaster said to me, 'i don't care if you do maths or biology or whatever, it doesn't matter ... but make sure that you use your imagination for creative good rather than self-destruction',"" recalls kelly. fast forward several decades and she's done just that. today kelly, 59, is the artistic director of britain's beloved cultural institution -- london's southbank centre. looking back, it's clear how defining that very moment was. ""as soon as he said it, i knew he was right -- i feel very strongly that young people deserve help, time, space and permission to be expressive."" his advice spurred kelly to form a drama club with her fellow classmates including clive barker, the now bestselling british horror author, and comedian les dennis. after high school, her passion for the arts continued to flourish. studying drama at birmingham university, she decided to become a director. it was a bold career choice for women in the 1970s -- but by age 22, she defied naysayers by becoming one of the youngest artistic directors in the country. ""if you have a sense that you want to make the world change, then you've got to go and do it. you can't ask somebody else to change the world for you."" it's hard not to be intimidated by kelly before meeting her. her illustrious career has seen her open and run theater houses across the country, such as the west yorkshire playhouse and battersea arts centre. directing over 100 productions including the royal shakespeare company, the national theatre, chichester festival theatre, the english national opera, the chã¢talet in paris while in the west end, she has worked with some of industry's finest thespians, including sir ian mckellen and sir patrick stewart. but as kelly enters her glass office, i'm immediately struck by how her theatrical aura and energetic spirit fills the room. wearing a sleek black dress over her petite frame, she crosses her legs showing off a simple pair of sneakers -- an unlikely combination that works. wasting no time, she delves into her passion for combining education with the arts. ""i believe wholeheartedly that in terms of human progress, arts education and arts and cultural expression is a key part of how great societies develop,"" says kelly. as she leans forward, she talks of creativity being the key to helping troubled youth -- a path she can relate to. ""my experience [is] that if i hadn't found that sense of purpose and identification, and had a way of doing it, that my life could have turned out differently."" ""to lose any generation because they haven't been able to fulfill their potential is a tragedy,"" she adds. so far, during her tenure as head of southbank centre and a once wayward teen herself -- she has made it her mission to provide a space for young people to express themselves. to that end, britain's largest arts center is currently undergoing a massive refurbishment to develop a festival wing which will include a youth village, a children's future center, arts education studios and a backstage space for emerging djs, dancers, filmmakers and photographers to cultivate their skills. additionally, the cultural hub offers a schools-in-residence program giving educational institutions the opportunity to move all of their classes to the southbank location and immerse the students with the subjects while on the premises. ""we are also working with all kinds of urban artists -- hip-hop artists, graffiti artists, parkour, bmx riders -- sort of merging of culture, leisure and art so that young people have a route in [to the arts] via the thing that excites them."" but kelly's commitment to ensuring the art world is inclusive goes one step further. not content with the investment made in shaping female minds of the future, in 2011 kelly established the women of the world (wow) festival. held each march in honor of international women's day, it's an event she calls ""a celebration of everything women and girls can do, have done and could do."" the week-long festival provides an opportunity for women to come together, share success stories and network. it has proven so popular that the wow festival has spread to a number of cities across the globe, most recently in baltimore and sydney. ""women very often have been amazing pioneers in a sense of saying here's something that is clearly missing on the landscape and it needs somebody to roll their sleeves up and make it happen,"" says kelly. ""i'm not saying it's only women that pioneer in the arts, but i think that people would be shocked to understand just how many women have put in the scaffolding upon which current arts policy has been created."" from ethel smyth, a british conductor and member of the suffrage movement, to lilian baylis, a theatrical producer who opened london's old vic theater, kelly admits, as an artistic director, she has often looked to female role models for inspiration. these days kelly herself has become somewhat of a pioneer of the arts. she sat on the london 2012 cultural olympiad board, represents britain on cultural affairs within unesco and is the founder and chair of metal, an artistic laboratory. in 1997 she received the honor of order of the british empire (obe) for her services to british arts and culture. and in february, kelly was named one of the 100 most powerful women in britain by bbc radio 4's women's hour. while she doesn't recognize her work as revolutionary, she does believe she has been part of a larger shift in the uk's cultural landscape.

"-- it seemed like a good idea at the time: skip the ""jonas brothers: the 3d concert experience"" -- the only major wide release this weekend and more or less review-proof -- and check out the new releases down at the local dvd store instead. jeremy strong and fairuza balk star in ""humboldt county,"" though she doesn't hang around long. i was up for this assignment. we all know how close ""slumdog millionaire"" came to bypassing theatres. the film was initially bankrolled by warner independent, and when that boutique shingle was rolled into parent warner bros., some executive decided that the year's best picture should not pass go -- skip the $200 -- and head straight to the rental chains. (warner bros., like cnn, is a division of time warner.) if it could happen to ""slumdog,"" what other gems might be out there? i scan the shelves. ""high school musical 3."" ""w."" ""how to lose friends and alienate people."" i'm a movie critic -- been there, done that. a harder look produces a handful of possibilities. i zero in on three unfamiliar titles. ""humboldt county"" boasts the participation of former child star fairuza balk while the quote from time out new york promises ""a pleasant buzz."" ""ghost writer"" doesn't come with any critical endorsement, just a groaner for a tagline (""deadline has a new meaning""), cover art that says horror-suspense, and an oddball cast: alan cumming, david boreanaz, anne heche, henry thomas, jane lynch, karen black and carrie fisher. intriguing. finally, there's ""lullaby"" (""he took her son ... now she'll take him"") starring oscar best actress nominee melissa leo. with its unfashionable sepia artwork and mom-on-the-warpath scenario, this looks like a 1970s grindhouse flick. not best picture material, i'm thinking, but then again, when did you last see a bad melissa leo performance? never, i'll bet. it's a crapshoot, so to improve the odds i take all three. first up is ""humboldt county."" it turns out this did get a theatrical release. it opened on nine screens in september and went down from there, so unless you actually live in humboldt county, which is in far northern california, you probably missed it. and if the movie is to be believed, even if you do live there you probably still missed it, because you were otherwise engaged in farming illegal substances, gazing at the shoreline, and/or hanging out with your quirky neighbors. it's an alternative lifestyle that sneaks up on the very straight, anxious young med student peter (jeremy strong). he's inducted by ""bogart"" (balk), but scarcely seems to notice when she disappears in the second reel, leaving him in the care of rosie and jack (frances conroy and brad dourif), not to mention her last boyfriend, max (chris messina). in keeping with the hazy vibe of the thing, nothing much happens -- slowly. peter misses the bus out of town, more than once. eventually you realize days, even weeks have gone by and bogart still hasn't returned. you wonder if peter and max might hook up in her absence? but that would harsh the mood. instead things just drift by. what does the world need with another doctor anyhow -- and where's zach braff when you need him? so i'm underwhelmed by ""humboldt county,"" but it's a masterpiece beside ""ghost writer."" shown in festivals as ""suffering man's charity"" -- possibly the worst title i've ever heard -- ""ghost writer"" is the story of an effete gay music teacher, john (alan cumming), harboring an unrequited crush on sebastian (boreanaz), a rampantly heterosexual drifter and aspiring novelist he has invited into his home. john gets madder and madder with sebastian until the day he knocks him out, dresses him in a bra and panties, ties him up with fairy lights and starts swinging. it sounds horrific but it's pitched as an arch black comedy, and so incongruously staged by alan cumming (who also directs) that it's neither funny nor scary, except in how scarily unfunny it is. mind you, the scene in which horny 69-year-old karen black makes out with boreanaz taps a camp hysteria that puts the rest of this flaccid flick to shame. two down. now my hopes are riding on ""lullaby."" i check out the internet movie database and wish i hadn't: ""lullaby"" has a user rating of 2.8 out of 10. leo is stephanie, a waitress who is getting hit up for money by a foreign gangster who says he has her (grown) son, a junkie. so stephanie does what any self-respecting mom would do. she sells her car, borrows from her friends, and buys a plane ticket to south africa to deliver the thug his ransom in person. only the price has gone up. he gives her two hours to stump up another $2,000. directed by darrell roodt and produced in south africa, ""lullaby"" makes no sense in any way except one: leo's performance does. the ""homicide"" and ""frozen river"" actress soldiers through this thing with dogged commitment, as if she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from. if that means taking a gig shooting in the sleaziest crime neighborhood in jo'burg, well, it's still better to play a waitress than be one. i know exactly how she feels. after all, i could be watching the jonas brothers right now.

""we join the rest of south africa in deploring this violence,"" said achmat dangor, ceo of the nelson mandela foundation, according to a statement released on monday. ""whatever the underlying causes they have to be addressed, but this senseless violence is not a solution."" police said those behind the attacks accused the foreigners of stealing jobs, carrying out criminal activities and benefiting from social services -- such as free housing -- meant to benefit south africans. ireport.com: are you there? send photos, video police arrested more than 200 people during the violence for offenses including rape, murder, robbery and theft. police said at least one foreigner was burned alive over the weekend, while others had their houses torched, their shops looted and their possessions stolen. many have sought refuge at police stations. some women have told police they were raped as part of an effort to drive the immigrants out. south africa's police director govindsamy mariemuthoo said 22 people had been killed in the past week. the red cross estimates some 3,000 more were displaced. the attacks were concentrated in some of the poorest parts of south africa where locals are jobless, hungry and in need of basic services such as clean water, sanitation and housing. south african president thabo mbeki called for an investigation into the violence. he has been reluctant to describe it as xenophobic because many south africans have criticized his government for not doing enough to deal with the crisis in neighboring zimbabwe. zimbabwe is in the midst of an economic collapse, with nearly 80 percent unemployment and inflation estimated to be at 160,000 percent. in addition, it is also in a state of political limbo. a presidential runoff between long-time leader president robert mugabe and his opposition challenger morgan tsvangirai is scheduled for june 27 -- three months after the initial vote. opposition leaders have accused the government of carrying out a campaign of political intimidation ahead of the runoff. the economic and political situation has seen an influx of zimbabweans to south africa, seeking a better life. archbishop desmond tutu also condemned the violence and urged south africans to remember the help that he and other anti-apartheid leaders received from neighboring countries. ""although they were poor, they welcomed us south africans as refugees, and allowed our liberation movements to have bases in their territory even if it meant those countries were going to be attacked by the sadf (south african defense forces),"" tutu said.

""we have recently received marlise munoz's medical records, and can now confirm that mrs. munoz is clinically brain dead, and therefore deceased under texas law,"" attorneys jessica janicek and heather king said in an e-mail. meanwhile, the judge in the case has recused herself from ""all remaining proceedings"" and asked that another judge be assigned, according to the order for recusal. no reason for the recusal is cited, and melody mcdonald, a spokeswoman for the tarrant county district attorney's office, said the office learned late wednesday afternoon that the judge had stepped down. the case was transferred to the 96th district court in the county, according to a court order signed friday. ""i do not have any other details, and we will have no further comment at this time,"" she said. munoz's husband, erick, asked a court tuesday to force a hospital to take her off a respirator, ventilator and other machines, saying her wishes shouldn't be disregarded just because she is pregnant. erick munoz filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against john peter smith hospital, both with the same goal: to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial. ""marlise munoz is legally dead, and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous,"" her husband says in the motion. erick munoz -- like his wife, a paramedic by training -- said previously that doctors told him his wife ""had lost all activity in her brain stem,"" and an accompanying chart stated that she was ""brain dead,"" according to his lawsuit. the hospital referred requests for comment to the tarrant county district attorney's office, which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit. it is legal counsel for john peter smith hospital ""in a number of civil areas."" in a brief court document filed friday, the civil defendant said simply, ""tarrant county hospital district d/b/a jps health network generally denies, each and every, all and singular, the allegations contained in plaintiff's original petition and demands strict proof of the same."" at this time, no hearing has been scheduled in the case. hospital spokesman j.r. labbe said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a texas law that says ""you cannot withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient."" munoz's husband responded by saying that ""marlise cannot possibly be a pregnant patient -- marlise is dead."" furthermore, he argued that her wishes -- relayed, he said, in conversations but not in writing that she not be on ""life-sustaining"" measures when she is brain dead -- shouldn't be treated differently from a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy. mother of pregnant woman on life support: change the law last month, erick munoz discussed with cnn affiliate wfaa his wife's wishes and how their shared occupation had helped shape her views. ""we'd seen things out in the field. we both knew that we didn't want to be on life support,"" he said. ""we reached a point where you wish your wife's body would just stop."" lynne machado, marlise munoz's mother, said tuesday the family is not talking about the case but said she and her husband, ernest, agree with erick munoz that their daughter would want to be removed from the machines. 'against the expressed will' of family as the lawsuit details, the story began at 2 a.m. on november 26, when erick found his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor. at the time, she was 14 weeks' pregnant with the couple's second child. soon after that, she was taken to john peter smith hospital, where erick munoz says he was told that his wife ""was for all purposes brain dead."" the family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen. in the lawsuit, he says subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and, in turn, the state law used to justify them -- amount ""to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family."" ""marlise munoz's death is a horrible and tragic circumstance, but by no means should (the hospital) be entitled to continue cutting into her deceased body in front of her husband and family under the guise of 'life-sustaining' treatment,"" the lawsuit says. dr. jeffrey ecker, director of obstetrical clinical research and quality assurance at massachusetts general hospital, works on complicated pregnancies and prenatal diagnosis. he says nothing scientifically in marlise munoz's pregnancy is black and white. ""a lot depends, first of all, on how long the patient here was deprived of oxygen, or otherwise compromised. we can certainly use tools like ultrasound and mri to sometimes see where there has been injury as a result of low blood pressure or low oxygen. but just seeing that things look well isn't the same as saying that things will be well,"" he told cnn. ""those things can't perfectly predict health and outcome. and there are certainly occasions where as we look as best as we can tell, a fetus seems to be developing appropriately and meeting all its milestones, and yet after birth, after delivery, there is evidence of profound compromise,"" ecker said. tom mayo, a southern methodist university law professor who helped write the applicable texas law, said he believes the hospital is misinterpreting it. ""she's not a patient anymore,"" he said. ""and so i don't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really don't have a patient."" the texas law states that a ""person may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient."" mayo said, ""the provision they seem to be relying on is called the pregnancy exclusion. more than 30 states have this pregnancy exclusion in their law. ... if they're relying on that provision, i think texas law in that respect does not compel the provision of life-sustaining treatment."" when 'life support' is really 'death support' cnn's vivian kuo, elizabeth landau and ed lavandera contributed to this report.","new: hospital ""denies each and every"" allegation by woman's family"

"-- the homicide rate in mexico's most violent city -- ciudad juarez -- is down, according to mexican president felipe calderon, but some residents of the city are not convinced. ""we are facing an entirely political statement, which is not based on reality. a statistic must be considered as a long process and not in a comparison of one month to another,"" ciudad juarez criminologist oscar maynes said. over the weekend, calderon said homicides had fallen by 60% in juarez since last october, comparing statistics from that month with april's numbers. speaking during an event that commemorated the city's 100th anniversary and its participation in the mexican revolution, calderon said juarez was ""going through a time of darkness"" and defended his crime-fighting strategy. ""there are probably variations and jumps [in the murder rate] because the evil of criminals are still there, but we must persevere in our efforts,"" he said. but several days after calderon's departure, some residents remained skeptical of his assessment. ""the president just came here and (violence) went down, but to say 60 or 70% is a lie -- he just left and the violence continues,"" juarez resident gaspar rocha told cnn. ""you have seen what has happened in the past and it will continue and continue and (calderon) will leave. they're just words...it's a lie."" university professor hugo almada cautioned that the government should take a more measured approach. ""it seemed to me that the tone of the speech was very triumphant, and it should have been more moderate, because we have already had other moments in which it seems there a slight decrease in the situation, and later it picks up again,"" he said. october 2010 saw a record of 359 homicides in the city, according to figures kept by the chihuahua state attorney general's office. the deadliest month was followed by 198 homicides in november and 213 in december. the pace of homicides continued into the new year, with 215 killed in january and 231 in february. in march and april 2011 there were 176 and 271 homicides, respectively. in his speech, calderon used figures from the country's public safety secretary, which said there had been 166 homicides in april and 417 in october 2010. the state attorney general's office said there has been a marked decrease in homicides in may, with 118 victims so far. maynes said the recent decline is due to multiple factors, but not to police or intelligence strategies of government officials. ""violence is down at the border, but they have killed many people. people with resources have gone, or are paying an extortion fee, but i do not see any strategy that is working,"" maynes said. to accurately measure a trend, it's necessary to compare rates over a one-year period, not month to month, maynes said. ""we have to recognize that the economy has not improved, the shops are closed -- that is the most valid demonstration. the effect is not just felt in terms of border killings, but also kidnapping, extortion and assaults,"" he added. during calderon's visit, state officials said they were beginning a new effort to help re-brand the city's violent image: changing its name. government officials approved a name change to ""heroic ciudad juarez"" to emphasize the city's participation in the mexican revolution, but only as a symbolical slogan and not for official purposes, said enrique serrano escobar, coordinator with the office of chihuahua state representatives. homicides in juarez, which borders el paso, texas, are often attributed to two violent drug cartels battling for turf in the city. ciudad juarez is the city with the highest number of homicides in mexico, with a record 8,000 victims since 2008, according to the chihuahua state attorney general's office. but this week, the city saw a brief respite. for 28 hours, between 7 p.m. monday and 11 p.m. tuesday, there were no reports of homicides. journalist edgar roman contributed to this report.","calderon says violence is down 60%, comparing statistics from october and april"

"-- no one ever expected the humble pencil to kickstart a revolution. but, by peeling apart pencil graphite into atom-thick layers using regular adhesive tape, two russian-born scientists, andre geim and konstantin novoselov, earned a nobel prize in 2010. with it, they sparked the beginnings of a material that could change the world. it is no exaggeration to say that graphene, the substance that the two scientists -- along with others -- discovered in 2004, is a miracle material. now a korean research lab may have made the leap from theoretical to practical with the development of a new way to synthesize it, potentially on a commercial scale. the substance, ""the perfect atomic lattice,"" boasts a number of hugely attractive properties, meaning it has the potential to be used in myriad industries, and for a huge range of purposes. attractive properties as well as being super-strong -- 20 times stronger than diamond, 200 stronger than steel and six times lighter -- it is also remarkably conductive, both electrically and thermally. if that wasn't enough, it is also almost perfectly transparent, impermeable to gas, and its properties are, scientists say, easily alterable. graphene is one form -- an allotrope -- of carbon, the basis of all life on earth. more familiar carbon allotropes include diamonds and graphite. what makes it unique is its thinness -- at one atom thick it is as good as two-dimensional. its flexibility means that it could potentially be used for flexible or wearable devices. ""graphene has a lot of potential, especially in terms of industrial applications for optical and electronic devices,"" says ping sheng, a professor of nanoscience at hong kong university of science and technology. ""the caveat is really in the quality of the graphene that can be produced on a large scale ... if they can overcome that then it will be a big breakthrough."" another byproduct of its remarkable thinness is its low weight. it could be used to create ultra-light components for, say, the aviation industry, dramatically reducing the weight of aircraft -- and thus significantly improving fuel efficiency -- without compromising strength or integrity. the substance is so versatile that it has even been touted as the future of condoms. the bill and melinda gates foundation last year awarded a $100,000 grant to fund the development of graphene prophylactics. drawbacks currently, its limitations include the fact that its conductivity can't be turned ""off,"" meaning that as a semiconductor it is useless, although researchers are experimenting with the substance to figure out a way around this problem. one possible fix could be to build artificial breaks in the substance, allowing for circuits to be opened and closed, or to alter its properties with the use of chemicals. if this deficiency can be overcome, however, graphene could be used in a huge range of devices as a super-fast replacement for silicon transistors, which are already reaching their capacity. graphene has one hundred times the electron mobility of silicon. another limitation comes in the form of its production -- currently it can only be synthesized in small crystals. while this is enough for researchers to test its properties and understand the tantalizing benefits of the material, it is not sufficient to produce it for mass commercial use. but with an announcement made last week, all this could change. public- and private-sector funding governments and the private sector are actively exploring the potential of the substance, with the eu devoting â‚¬1 billion ($1.3 billion) to it between 2013 and 2023, funding research which could potentially transform a range of sectors, including electronics, energy, health and construction. the samsung advanced institute of technology last week announced it had developed ""a breakthrough synthesis method"" of producing graphene, and the hopes are that this will pave the way for the commercialization of the material. the results were published in the journal science. samsung sees graphene as the ""perfect material"" for next generation device, and the breakthrough could have huge implications for its commercial production.

"(cnn)got an idea on how to make a flying aircraft carrier? the defense department wants to know about it. the defense advanced research products agency has a request out for ideas on how to develop an airborne platform that could both launch and recover other aircraft. but before you start looking for schematics of the starship enterprise (ncc-1701) or battlestar galactica, or how you might levitate the uss nimitz, think a little smaller, like b-1, b-52 or c-130. darpa wants ideas on how to turn those aircraft currently in the pentagon inventory into platforms that could carry unmanned aerial systems, what most folks call drones, close to their targets. the drones could then go about their business -- bombing, missile strikes, reconnaissance, etc. -- then fly back to the mother ship and head for home. this plan could add to the range of the drones and open up new missions they cannot now undertake because of their limited range, darpa says. as you consider your ideas, darpa says you have to keep the cost low and they'd like something they could demonstrate within four years. and don't get long-winded. your proposal should fit on eight, standard 8.5- x 11-inch pages in 11-point type. and if you're worried your big plans will fall into the hands of your competitors, don't. darpa promises all ideas will stay inside the pentagon. the deadline is november 26. now get to work.",pentagon wants aerial platform to carry drones
"-- we had no idea five guys with a clever photo tradition would capture so much interest. but the overwhelming response to a recent story about high school friends who've kept in touch over three decades through summer lakeside reunions and a commemorative photo shoot made us wonder what other creative ways people document their travels, relationships and experiences. if you're traveling with andrew bennett, you know he'll hand over a camera to capture him doing a handstand in front of some of the world's noted landmarks. is the photo better than the vacation? bear, an aptly named stuffed animal, is likely to turn up in sue brady's travel shots. claire warmenbol doesn't need any help or props: she simply points her camera at her feet to get the right shots. in an era of digital photography and smartphones, it's easier than ever to create special traditions. the photo essay is no longer limited to professional photographers or people documenting the first day of school, christmas or a college reunion. seven beauties of the british isles where the tradition starts ireporter bennett wanted a twist on the usual smiling-in-front-of-a-landmark shot. ""i thought to myself, 'i bet there aren't too many pictures of people doing handstands in front of the eiffel tower,'"" wrote bennett, an austin, texas, resident who started his tradition in 2007 when he was studying abroad in spain. ""so i started doing handstands everywhere we went. i've traveled abroad several times since that trip, most recently to israel this summer, and the tradition has continued."" geneva-based ireporter claire warmenbol, who has been taking pictures of her feet around the world for about 10 years, thinks she started snapping shots in response to the question, ""why do you travel so much?"" her answer: ""itchy feet!"" warmenbol often travels alone for the great sense of freedom it gives her. from the stoop to social media steve springer's photo project didn't start with photography or travel in mind. on august 25, 1971, his bronx-based trio of childhood friends were in high school when they decided to meet at the stoop where they always hung out in exactly 10 years. they didn't take a picture that day, but found a photo later taken about that time and decided to replicate it each decade. every 10 years, springer, steve haimowitz, errol honig and other friends and assorted spouses and children travel from florida, washington, d.c., california and just around the block to meet at the stoop to take the picture (standing in the same positions), play stickball and reminisce. now the photos are posted on former cnn staffer springer's blog and the group's facebook page. the men even made a youtube video of their photo shoot. ""that stoop was our hangout, it's where if we weren't playing ball or going to movies or playing records, that's where we hung out,"" said springer. the tradition and the electronic community the men have created is ""simply a continuation of a friendship built 40 years ago, and we're trying to keep it going and keep it alive. people post every day on our facebook page. it's like we're hanging out on the stoop."" last year's 40th anniversary celebration was delayed by 24 hours because honig was driving his daughter to start college in upstate new york. ""that seemed an awfully good reason to delay things by 24 hours,"" wrote springer on his blog. 27 must-sees on earth gratitude for many things while the photos bring back memories, they also remind people of their families, friends and other items on their gratitude lists. ""i think about how blessed i've been to have had the opportunity to go to all these places,"" bennett wrote. ""some were during study abroad, some were on family vacations, and some were for work with isa (international studies abroad). i also try not to take myself too seriously, so doing handstands is my way of keeping a light heart during my travels. warmenbol's ritual reminds her why she travels. ""it's 'me' moments on holidays, key moments of being somewhere special; capturing stillness whilst being on the move,"" she wrote. it's not too late to start a tradition a friend gave ""bear"" to sue brady of los banos, california, after brady's gentleman friend of 22 years passed away three years ago. brady, 63, had always traveled with her companion, and now preferred to travel alone -- except for bear, the stuffed polar bear. he has joined brady on her travels around the country and became the star of her travel pictures. ""some people when i take the picture will smile and think it's cute, and some people look at me like i'm nuts."" having bear along makes traveling more fun, she said. if you don't want to take the same picture every time you travel or return to a hometown you never liked, you don't have to make the same commitment as these travelers. ""you don't have to wait 30 years to get the same sequence of pictures,"" says heather maddan, chief storyteller at shutterfly.com and manager of the website's storytelling section. ""it doesn't have to be 'let's meet at the lake.' it could be any day. you could go out for the weekend and take the same picture every day (and see the progression of the weekend)."" for the hard-core enthusiast: a challenge for those of you interested in a more intense challenge, turn to charles and rose benoit for inspiration. the rochester, new york, couple, who married in 1984, started taking a picture of themselves every single day about 20 years ago. ""it all started one night when we were looking for pictures after many of our friends started to have kids,"" said rose benoit. ""we had pictures of all our friends' kids (and) we didn't have any pictures of us together."" now the benoits have pictures from all over the world. ""when we used to live overseas, we were both teachers and we went to this educational conference where jane goodall was a speaker, so we took a picture with jane goodall,"" she said.

"-- the phrase ""war on terror"" is misleading and may have done more harm than good as countries around the world fight extremism, british foreign secretary david miliband said thursday. use of ""war on terror"" also implied a fight against a shared single enemy, david miliband said. miliband said in a speech in mumbai, india, that the phrase joined nations against a common enemy rather than together with common ideals. ""ultimately, the notion is misleading and mistaken,"" miliband said. ""historians will judge whether it has done more harm than good."" the foreign secretary spoke at the taj hotel, the historic building set ablaze during the terrorist attacks in the coastal city in november, on the last day of his three-day trip to india. he praised the response of the indian people after the attacks and expressed britain's sympathy and support. he said the british government has refrained from using ""war on terror"" recently because it does not accurately describe the threat that the uk, india, or other countries now face. ""the notion of a war on terror gave the impression of a unified, transnational enemy, embodied in the figure of osama bin laden and the organization of al qaeda,"" miliband said. ""in fact, as india has long known, the forces of violent extremism remain diverse. terrorism is a deadly tactic, not an institution or an ideology."" the phrase also implies that the best response to terrorism is a military one, tracking down and killing hardcore extremists, miliband said. he pointed to the u.s.-led coalition's challenge in iraq, where ""the coalition there could not kill its way out of the problems of insurgency and civil strife."" use of ""war on terror"" also implied a fight against a shared single enemy, miliband said. it aimed for solidarity among nations based on who they are against instead of what they are for. ""democracies must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law, not subordinating it,"" he said. ""if we want to promote the politics of consent instead of terror and of democratic opportunity rather than fear and oppression, we must uphold our commitments to human rights and civil liberties both at home and abroad."" he added that it was a lesson learned from the u.s. prison camp at guantanamo bay, cuba, and he said britain welcomed president-elect barack obama's commitment to close it.","phrase ""war on terror"" may have done more harm than good, uk minister says"
"-- comedian katt williams on saturday partly walked back an apology for making insensitive remarks to a mexican member of his audience, telling cnn that he is not sorry for what he said, but apologizes to anyone who thought he was being hateful. ""i meant what i said and i said what i meant,"" williams said, referring to his back-and-forth with a heckler during a performance a week ago. a written statement apologizing for the remarks had been released by his publicist on his behalf this week, but the comedian said that it didn't come from him. video of the exchange, delivered during a performance at the celebrity theater in phoenix, was posted online. williams singled out a man seated near the stage and asked him if he was mexican. ""do you remember when white people used to say 'go back to africa,' and we'd have to tell them we don't want to? so if you love mexico, (expletive), get the (expletive) over there!"" williams said to the man. it turned into a back-and-forth profanity-laced argument with the man, williams exclaimed, ""we were slaves, (expletive). you just work like that as landscapers."" on saturday, williams said the man started heckling him first with an expletive aimed at the united states. ""if a person starts their heckling with 'f' america, then that gives me the right to defend my country,"" williams said. ""i don't think i need to apologize for being pro-american."" williams, an african-american comedian known more for his erratic behavior than his jokes in recent months, said that he can't be anti-mexican because many of them are his fans. ""the guy said that all of (arizona) is still mexico, and i was giving him geography,"" williams said. the conversation was with the one man and not with the rest of the crowd, he said. ""if i had disrespected mexicans, i wouldn't have been able to get out of there alive,"" he said. one arizona activist, rev. jarrett maupin, had called williams' words ""borderline hate speech and racially offensive."" maupin had accepted the written apology and called on the comedian to return to arizona to show his commitment to the latino community, much like comedian tracy morgan's return to nashville, tennessee, this summer to personally apologize for anti-gay remarks in a stand-up show there. but williams told cnn that as a comic, he cannot apologize for his uncensored thoughts during a show.

"-- coal-producing giant massey energy defended its safety record monday after the worst u.s. mine disaster in decades and rebuffed calls for its ceo to step down. stan suboleski, a member of massey's board of directors, acknowledged the company's upper big branch mine had a high number of citations for serious safety violations. but he said federal inspectors found ""no major issues"" with the mine a few days before the april 5 explosion that killed 29 miners, and no hazards were found the day of the explosion. in addition, suboleski said, the federal mine safety and health administration required changes to the mine's ventilation system in september that company engineers found ""significantly reduced"" the amount of fresh air that reached the portion of the mine where work was taking place, and the company resisted that change ""to the point of shutting down production for two days"" before agreeing. amy louviere, a spokeswoman for msha, said the issue subleski raised will be part of its investigation of the disaster. ""msha's accident investigation team will thoroughly examine the mine's ventilation plan and any changes required by msha in order to determine the volume of air flow,"" louviere told cnn. a preliminary report on the disaster by msha found that the upper big branch mine had ""a significant history of safety issues"" and that the agency was closely monitoring massey energy. in 2009, federal inspectors issued 515 citations and orders at the upper big branch mine, with 39 percent of them for ""significant and substantial"" violations. massey's safety record came under a harsh spotlight after the disaster at the upper big branch mine. its ceo, don blankenship, has been an outspoken critic of federal regulators, and at least two investment funds have called for his resignation since the explosion earlier this month. but another massey director, bobby inman, said blankenship had the board's confidence, and that changing leadership ""in the midst of a crisis"" would be a bad idea. ""when the crisis has subsided and we know the facts, we will maintain the highest standard of accountability and responsibility,"" inman said during a news conference in charleston, west virginia. and blankenship offered condolences to the families and co-workers of the men who died in the blast, saying, ""we know there are no words to describe either their losses or the sorrow they are experiencing."" ""in the past 20 years, we have done our best to engineer the dangers out of coal mining,"" blankenship said. ""we have made great strides and been proud of our accomplishments. but on april 5, we lost 29 great coal miners, and we don't know why. this has left us humbled and hurt and searching for answers."" since the disaster, president obama has ordered a review of mines with poor safety records. he called massey's safety record ""troubled"" in an april 15 appearance. massey called the criticism ""regrettable.""",massey board member stan suboleski admits mine had lots of safety citations
"(cnn)africa is a continent. it's not a country. this, unfortunately, is a notion that needs to be constantly reinforced. though it is enormous and as diverse as any place can be, we tend, in the west, to look at it like a monolith. in fact, even neighboring countries like rwanda and the democratic republic of the congo can feel, up close, as different as mars and texas. liberia and namibia bear almost no resemblance to each other. ghana and morocco? maybe it's the sheer size and complexity of african issues -- the at times crushing weight of history, the ugliness of much of that history, europe and the west's unambiguous complicity in so much of it -- that keeps us from even trying to look beyond the surface. over the years, my crew and i have shot in liberia, ghana, namibia, south africa, mozambique, the congo and much of north africa. but what we've never done, was step back to our first impressions, to the africa of hollywood films and nature documentaries that many of us grew up with: vast herds of wild animals charging across the serengeti, lions and giraffes and zebras and hippos, safari gear, land rovers and the equally magnificent ""natives"" in their brightly colored robes. does this africa even exist? and if so, how? and for whom? that africa, the cinemascope africa does exist. you can find it in and around the unspeakably beautiful ngorongoro crater in tanzania where lions and their traditional adversaries, masai warriors, still live much as they did a hundred years ago. the lions survive because they are protected. visiting tanzania to gaze at and photograph these beautiful but deadly creatures (and other animals) is a major industry, bringing many millions to the country each year. it makes financial sense to protect both animals and the environment they live in. the masai, on the other hand, believe themselves to be the keepers and protectors of all the world's cattle. their status, their wealth is based almost entirely on number of cattle and goats. their diet, traditionally, has been almost exclusively meat (mostly goat and the occasional bit of cow's blood) and dairy. they generally use their cattle to provide dairy and tap them for blood (without harming them) to mix with curdled milk. in return, adult masai enjoy cardio and physical strength and endurance that would qualify as olympian any day of the week. they are herders -- and warriors. their status within their tribe, their image of themselves based largely on their traditional roles as defenders of their herds -- as warriors, lion killers. lions eat cattle and goats when they can get them. the masai protect and rely on cattle and goats to live. lions roam over large areas of terrain, competing for food with any number of other predators. masai herd their cattle over large areas of terrain. thus it has been for centuries. lions are beautiful living creatures worth many millions of dollars from the thousands and thousands of people from all over the world who want to come to tanzania and gape at them. the masai are beautiful living people who somewhat fewer people from all over the world want to come and gape at. you see the problem. many hard working, well-intentioned people are trying to help resolve this conflict of interest. but it raises, once again, the question we run into frequently in our travels: who does the natural world exist for? for the people who live there, have always lived there? even when they become ... inconvenient? or the animals who also have always lived there, but like their adversaries, are under threat, and can no longer survive without the intervention of (usually) pale-skinned experts in comfortable shoes? it's an uncomfortable question. one would have to be truly monstrous to suggest that one be sacrificed for the other. but the slow grind of history is already making that decision for us, and the outcome is often not pretty. if we are the guardians of the environment, obligated to do our very best to protect the natural world -- if that natural world, increasingly, exists only at our pleasure and as the result of much hard work and vigilance -- are we not also our brothers' keepers? where is that line? that balance between the needs of man and that of the incredible, graceful, terrible, gorgeous creatures who still manage to survive in what passes for the wild? i sure as hell don't know. so, on one hand, this episode is the ""nature show"" we always hoped to do -- the ""safari show"". and believe me, we did it right. i retired, after a long day's filming on the plains or in the bush, to a hot, freshly drawn bubble bath surrounded by rose petals. i drank sherry from a cut glass tumbler on my balcony, looking down into the ngorongoro crater. woke every morning to my choice of omelets and silver service. but the persistent image of this episode, the one that hangs in my memory, and i hope will hang in yours, is of the running man. the young masai. where is he going?","bourdain steps back to his first impressions of africa, a land of hollywood films and nature documentaries"
"-- security contractors in iraq use some over-the-top tactics and overreact at times, a top u.s. general in iraq said friday. members of a private security company prepare the way for a u.s. convoy in baghdad, iraq. many in iraq have witnessed security contractors operating in a questionable fashion, said u.s. army brig. gen. joseph anderson, chief of staff for the multi-national corps in iraq. ""i can certainly say i've seen them do some tactics that i thought were over the top. but that's something we've got to keep working out,"" anderson said in a briefing to pentagon reporters via teleconference from iraq. his comments soon after defense secretary robert gates said he wants closer oversight of pentagon contractors in iraq. gates has dispatched a team there to review accountability and oversight. anderson did not offer specific examples of incidents he had seen. he agreed security contractors in iraq have taken a lot of criticism, but he said they are in a tough position. ""they obviously have a tough job to do in a tough environment. i don't know if they're overly aggressive. i think the question becomes what rules do they follow with respect to what the rules of engagement are,"" he said. the actions of private security contractors have come under scrutiny since a baghdad shooting incident earlier this month. iraqi authorities say blackwater guards fired indiscriminately, killing as many as 20 civilians; blackwater says its employees responded properly to an insurgent attack on a convoy. under an order laid down by the u.s.-led occupation government in 2004, security contractors are not subject to iraqi law for actions taken within their contracts, a condition that irritates iraqi officials. about 137,000 civilians are working for the u.s. military in iraq, gates said wednesday. that number includes at least 7,300 of the estimated 25,000 private security contractors working in iraq, he said. after the blackwater shootings, deputy defense secretary gordon england issued a memo to commanders in iraq outlining their responsibility for holding contractors accountable, pentagon spokesman geoff morrell said. anderson said the assessment team sent by gates is getting a feel for how the military employs contractors, to what scale, what functions they're providing and what differentiates between department of defense and department of state contractors in the security role. the state department also is investigating the role of private security contractors. ambassador patrick kennedy, a management and policy expert, will lead the effort, along with a high-level panel of outside experts, including retired gen. george joulwan, former commander of nato forces in europe; stapleton roy, former u.s. ambassador to china; and eric boswell, a former assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security. secretary of state condoleezza rice wants an interim report by next friday. e-mail to a friend",u.s. general says he's seen private security contractors overreact
"-- a college student in nigeria has been sentenced to 19 years in prison for scamming an australian woman out of $47,000 online by pretending to be a widowed white businessman desperately in love with her. a court in ikeja in southwest nigeria ruled that lawal adekunie nurudeen will also have to pay back the 56-year-old woman, even if it meant selling the two plots of land and the honda prelude he bought with her money. nurudeen was an engineering student when he met the woman online in 2007, said the economic and financial crimes commission, nigeria's anti-corruption police. the woman lamented that she was looking for a husband but had been disappointed in the men she had met. ""the convict, who is married with three children, instantly applied and told the victim that she had met mr. right,"" the commission said in a statement. nurudeen pretended to be a 57-year-old british engineer working with a multinational company in nigeria. he told her his wife and only child had died in a road accident in lagos, the former capital of the country. ""he sent the picture of a white man to the victim to foreclose any suspicions,"" police said. the woman agreed to marry him. a few weeks later, nurudeen called the woman pretending to be a doctor. he told her that her fiance had been in an accident and needed money for treatment. the woman obliged, the commission said. nurudeen let two weeks pass. he then called the woman again, thanking her profusely for her kindness and telling her that he would like to visit her in australia. he asked her for airfare, cash for customs clearance and other incidentals, police said. authorities did not say how nurudeen was caught. but he duped the woman of $47,000 before his arrest, the commission said. scammers in nigeria have gained a reputation for using the internet to con foreign nationals out of money. some of the scams have earned the name ""419"" after the clause in the nigerian criminal code that deals with obtaining property under false pretense.",police: nurudeen was engineering student when he met the woman online in 2007
"-- japan's main trading index, the tokyo nikkei, plunged more than 7% thursday, ending a red-hot rally that saw the bourse climb nearly 50% since the start of the year. investors reacted to negative news from the united states and china. u.s. fed chair ben bernanke left an open question on whether quantitative easing would end earlier than hoped, while new china data revealed factory activity fell the first time in seven months. though questions loom over the world's first and second largest economies, analysts and economists agree that for japan, the world's third largest, things are just fine -- despite this week's stock slump. the fact that investors pulled out is ""a sign of health rather than a sign of worry,"" said jesper koll, director of japan equity research at jpmorgan in tokyo. ""when markets go one way then it's time to be concerned. the (nikkei) has been up basically 70% over the last seven months."" in the history of global stock markets, such a major rally is very rare, added koll. since world war ii, similar events have happened less than eight times. a correction was due. ""this looks like the selloff that so many on the sidelines have been waiting for,"" said nicholas smith, clsa's japan strategist in tokyo. ""the topix was undoubtedly overbought."" prime minister shinzo abe's fiscal policies for growth and inflation -- known to many now as abenomics -- are not to blame so much as financial quakes and questions from the world's other major economies. in support of abenomics, the bank of japan this past wednesday affirmed its own policies to buy long-term debt and securities. the move would double the central bank's monetary base over two years. ""such conduct of monetary policy will support the positive movements in economic activity and financial markets, contribute to a rise in inflation expectations, and lead japan's economy to overcome deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years,"" the bank said in its policy statement. during those years of deflation and up through abe's election to the premiership in december 2012, japan had a fiscal policy of ""musaku"" or ""no policy"" -- ""all talk but no action,"" explained jpmorgan's koll. now ""the most import thing is that japan does have a policy. with abe there is action. that's what has been making investors confident."" signs of proof can be found in the return to profit of some of japan's exporters, in part due to the yen's weakening against the u.s. dollar past the 100-yen mark. toyota, the world's biggest automaker, reported net income of $9.7 billion in the fiscal year that ended march 31 -- more than triple its earnings from the year prior. panasonic forecasts a net income of nearly $500 million in the 2014 fiscal year, versus a net loss of some $7 billion in 2013.

"-- for many years, guatemala has been a place of relatively uncomplicated adoptions for american parents. the small country's government estimates as many as 17 babies leave each day for adoptive parents in the united states. carolina, a 3-month-old guatemalan girl, was bound for the u.s. until guatemalan authorities intervened. but that number could soon drop to zero because of concerns over alleged improprieties in the guatemalan adoption process. guatemalan president oscar berger announced recently that adoptions to the united states will be suspended on january 1, 2008, a decision that could leave nearly 3,000 babies currently in the adoption pipeline in legal limbo. ""this is our heritage, our future,"" said carmen wennier, head of guatemala's social welfare bureau, who has criticized the adoption system. guatemala has the highest per capita rate of adoption in the world and the united states represents the largest number of adoptions, with an estimated one of every 100 guatemalan babies sent to the united states, according to the u.s. consulate in guatemala. u.s. officials estimate more than 5,000 adoptions from guatemala will be processed this year, an annual high which would make guatemala the second biggest origin of adoptive babies to the united states, behind china. adoption on hold after agency raided » adoption has been a hotly contested issue in guatemala for years. while adoptive parents in the united states undergo rigorous screening, adoptions in guatemala are processed under a notary system that allows lawyers and judges to place children for adoption. both guatemalan and u.s. officials fear the system leads to practices such as paying birth mothers for children, or, some instances, using coercion. ""we have thousands of cases of guatemalan children who have been adopted to the united states and have had terrific experiences as adoptive children there, and frankly, have probably experienced a life more full of opportunity and support than they would have if they had been abandoned in guatemala,"" u.s. ambassador to guatemala james derham said. ""what we want to do is make sure that all adoptions are consistent with these kinds of ideas."" both u.s. and guatemalan officials say gaps in the regulation and the high sums of money at play - adoptions can cost up to $30,000 to complete -- may have created unintended incentives in a country where the u.s. state department estimates 80 percent of the population lives in poverty. for prospective adoptive parents awaiting children in the united states, the recent developments are wrenching. but despite the state department warnings, dozens of americans still fill major hotels in guatemala city meeting babies they expect will soon be theirs. several hotels in the city offer adoption packages and baby-friendly amenities to prospective adoptive parents. the couples stay there when they come to first see the babies while waiting for paperwork to be processed or to pick them up at the end of the adoption process. many of those couples say the charges of coercion of birth mothers are overblown and that thousands of abandoned children will be condemned to a life of poverty if greater restrictions on adoptions are imposed. ""nobody reports on what will happen to these children if the adoptions are stopped,"" said one american parent who asked not to be identified. ""the city will be filled with street kids."" the increasing scrutiny of adoptions from guatemala already has thrown some adoptions into flux. carolina, a 3-month-old guatemalan girl, was just months away from joining her adoptive parents, ellen and sean darcy, in their boston, massachusetts, home, when she and 45 other babies were seized from casa quivira, an adoption agency, by the guatemalan government. ""casa quivira was the last stop on an assembly line,"" wennier told cnn. ""they had the final product and they had to sell it at the best price."" guatemala police arrested casa quivira's lawyers and charged them with child abduction. no plea has yet been entered, but the agency's owners, american cliff phillips and his guatemalan wife, sandra gonzalez, deny doing anything illegal. ""we can respond for the work of casa quivira and we will make all the efforts to clear our name, to get these kids home,"" gonzalez said through tears. she adamantly denies casa quivira wanted to do anything more than help save children from poverty and make american families whole. carolina's adoptive mom in the united states, ellen darcy, is worried about carolina's future, but she wants the investigation to go forward so she'll know if the adoption was legitimate.

""she was a very bright, engaging, sweet person, very intellectually curious,"" blyth said wednesday. bae said suveges' experience, which included a tour in iraq as a civilian contractor and a stint in bosnia in the 1990s as an army reservist, made her especially valuable in efforts to improve the lives of iraqis. a human terrain system statement said suveges and others were attending a meeting of the district advisory council on tuesday to elect a new chairman. the officials were helping mediate disputes among the sadr city leadership and ""facilitate the development of a more representative local government,"" the statement said. the attack was blamed on a shiite insurgent cell. suveges graduated from the university of illinois at chicago in 1992 and received a master's degree in political science from george washington university in 1998. she had delivered papers to international relations organizations and served as a graduate teaching assistant, the company said. at johns hopkins, she was managing editor for the review of international political economy, the university said. maj. mike kenfield, spokesman for the army's training and doctrine command, said that the program was credited for ""reductions in non-lethal operations"" and that there had been talk about expanding the purview of the team to outside iraq and afghanistan. cnn's joe sterling contributed to this report","nicole suveges, 38, was part of team of academic embeds advising military in iraq"

"it has been 35 years since a group of iranian students stormed the u.s. embassy in tehran and took a group of americans hostage. you have seen this story play out in movies like ""argo"" and shows like ""homeland,"" but here are six things about the iran hostage crisis that you may not have known. 1) this conflict is often described as the united states' first brush with political islam. in 1979, the ayatollah khomeini installed an anti-western islamic theocracy, which replaced the pro-western monarchy of the shah of iran. the u.s. was referred to as ""the great satan"" by the new iranian government, and iranians looked at the united states with suspicion because of its role in keeping the shah in power. iranians felt the united states meddled too much in iran's internal affairs, and were afraid the cia was plotting to return the shah to power. the ayatollah himself blessed the hostage-taking at the embassy, further fueling the government's hard line against the united states. 2) the u.s. embassy in tehran warned washington the embassy would be attacked. by october 1979, the shah had fled iran and was staying in mexico. there, doctors discovered the shah was suffering from an aggressive cancer and recommended he be admitted to a hospital in the united states. the situation in tehran was already tense, and the head of the diplomatic mission at the u.s. embassy in tehran sent several cables to washington, saying that if the shah was allowed to come to the united states for treatment, the embassy would be taken. president jimmy carter allowed the shah into the united states, with much hesitation, and the iranians were outraged. they saw this as an excuse to bring the shah to the united states to plot his return to power. this was just weeks before the embassy was attacked. 3) some of the hostages were beaten and tortured, and even underwent a mock execution. iran has maintained a narrative that the hostages were treated well, but that is not true. not all the hostages were treated the same. the two women, ann swift and kathryn koob, said they were treated ""correctly"" by their captors, but others, including al golacinski, john limbert and rick kupke, were subject to a mock execution, where they were awakened in the middle of the night, forced to strip to their underwear and marched to a room in the basement where their guards made it seem they were about to be executed by firing squad. the guards fired their weapons, but they were not loaded. then the guards laughed. why did they do it? limbert said it was because ""they thought it would be fun."" 4) the hostages were released only after president reagan was sworn in. ted koppel described this as the iranians' last act of cruelty toward president carter. even though the united states and iran had come to an agreement to free the hostages in december, the iranians waited literally until the hour president reagan was sworn in before allowing the plane with the hostages to take off. the iranians had a deep hatred of carter and wanted to deny him this last moment of victory as president. 5) after the hostages were released, they met with president jimmy carter. william daugherty, who was held in solitary confinement for almost the entire time he was a hostage, said, ""it was not a warm welcome"" when jimmy carter flew to the u.s. military base in germany to meet the hostages right after their release. the hostages were split on their thinking. many felt they were left unprotected in the embassy after carter made the decision to allow the shah into the united states. daugherty said that during the meeting, carter went around to hug all the hostages, and many remained still with their arms at their sides and did not return his hug. 6) the former u.s. embassy in tehran has been preserved as a museum. the embassy in tehran is now an islamic cultural center and a museum, preserved from the days when it was a prison in 1979. it stands as a symbol of the iranian revolution, and is known in iran as the ""den of spies."" old typewriters, communication equipment, even old visa photos, are on display. every year on the anniversary of the hostage taking, iranians hold rallies where ""death to america"" is chanted, just as it was in 1979.",the siege of the u.s. embassy in iran was 35 years ago
"-- a controversial british muslim cleric is threatening to stage a march through the town that receives the bodies of british war dead as a protest against the war in afghanistan, drawing fury and outrage. anjem choudary has accused soldiers of ""murderous crimes,"" and said the united states and united kingdom are seeking to ""establish their own military, economic, strategic and ideological interests in the region."" british and american troops are suffering ""depression"" as they realize ""there is no real moral or ethic (sic) reason for them to murder innocent men, women and children to fulfill their politicians (sic) agenda,"" the preacher says. his organization proposes to parade empty coffins through the streets of the english town of wootton bassett, where the bodies of british war dead are traditionally brought when they return to the country. relatives and friends line the streets of the town along with local residents as hearses carry the flag-draped british remains, in scenes of public mourning widely reported by british media. choudary has not announced a date for his planned march and local police said saturday he had not contacted them about it, as people planning marches are required to do before staging a demonstration. but the threat itself prompted more than 215,000 people to join a facebook group opposing the march as of monday, a day after he posted a letter online justifying it. ""the highway for heroes & wonderful people of wb do not deserve this march to happen,"" the group's home page says. ""this group can march anywhere it wishes in the country but have chosen wb to cause outrage & offense. islam4uk is an extremists (sic) islamic group & does not represent the muslim community in this country."" choudary's open letter, ""to the families of british soldiers who have died or who are currently in afghanistan,"" appeared on the web site of his organization, islam4uk, on sunday. the group had announced its intention to stage the protest earlier in a short statement on its web site. ""the procession in wootton basset (sic) is therefore an attempt to engage the british publics (sic) minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in body bags and the real cost of the war,"" choudary wrote. ""the parades, the speeches about soldiers doing their duty and the feeling of patriotism has obfuscated the reality of the conflict and the murderous crimes being committed by the occupiers and their agents. the british public is blissfully unaware of what is being done in their name,"" choudary wrote. ""afghanistan is not a british town near wootton basset (sic) but rather muslim land which no one has the right to occupy, with a muslim population who do not deserve their innocent men, women and children to be killed for political mileage and for the greedy interests of the oppressive u.s. and uk regimes,"" he said. choudary signs himself ""uk head of al-muhajiroun,"" a banned british group which supports al qaeda. choudary spoke positively of osama bin laden in the letter and in interviews with british media on monday. british prime minister gordon brown said sunday that there would be ""no support"" for the march or choudary's ""perverted view of islam."" ""i think most people in the islamic community believe that those people who have adopted a perverted view of islam to justify murder as terrorism are outside the traditional elements of what is a peaceful faith,"" he said. ""the vast majority of the muslim population in this country and other countries agrees with my view on this,"" brown said. police in wiltshire, the county where wootton bassett is located, said they had the authority to control the terms and conditions of the march or even to apply to ban it if choudary took steps towards staging it. ""if the march or procession is believed to be likely to result in serious disorder, disruption or damage, then the police can impose conditions upon the organizer,"" the police said in a statement. ""in exceptional circumstances, the police may apply to the local authority for an order prohibiting such a march.""

"(cnn)iraqi forces appear to be slowly closing in on an important tactical victory against isis. but as they press forward in their attempt to retake the city of tikrit from isis insurgents, there is an important question that the united states and its allies should be asking: could this victory actually undermine the only sustainable strategy for ensuring iraq's stability? the reality is that short-term tactical victories won't be enough to defeat isis, especially as the reliance on iran-backed shiite militias is only likely to exacerbate tensions with the largely local sunni population. indeed, the crucial ground war component of the campaign has so far been heavily reliant on the shiite militias, whose track record of sectarian violence is well-documented, and their involvement threatens to drive more iraqi sunnis into the arms of isis. gen. martin dempsey, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has said the involvement of these groups ""will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism."" but based on past experience, many locals are understandably more frightened by their designated ""liberators"" than they are of the vicious extremists of isis who have ruled their towns over the past eight months. historically, iraq hasn't always needed shiite militias under iran's command to fight sunni extremists. al qaeda was expelled from northern iraq in 2007, when its harsh rule antagonized tribal leaders that had supported the anti-u.s. insurgency, prompting them to make common cause with the americans in what became known as the ""awakening"" movement. unfortunately, once its goal had been achieved, baghdad rounded on the awakening, betraying promises of integration into the national army and polity and instead arresting and killing its leaders along with trusted sunni elected representatives. the united states looked the other way, deeming it a ""domestic"" political matter. that simply emboldened then-prime minister nuri al-maliki to deepen his purge of sunni elected representatives, and to parlay the 2010 election result into a governing coalition despite his own list drawing fewer votes than a rival bloc that included many sunni leaders. this undermined the work that the united states had done in persuading iraq's sunnis that fighting al qaeda and voting in elections was the best way to advance their communal interests. put simply, al-maliki's actions made a mockery of any sunni confidence in the electoral system or the national government. it was the resulting sunni alienation that allowed al qaeda's successor, isis, back into those communities. the growing fear among many sunnis has been compounded by prime minister haider al-abadi's statement to parliament that any iraqi choosing to stay neutral was effectively aligning themselves with isis -- remarks that create an atmosphere that enables violence against ordinary sunnis, many of whom feel caught between the extremists and a shiite-led government from which they have been systematically oppressed and alienated. and isis has undoubtedly capitalized on the permissive environment created by such alienation, which persists despite the obama administration having convinced itself that al-abadi would somehow prove to be more inclusive than his predecessors from the same shiite islamist party. all this suggests that the ""awakening"" experience, which showed that iraqi sunnis will reject violent extremists if they believe they will get a fair shake from the system for doing so, is as vital as ever to the prospects of defeating isis. but the outcome must be different from the last awakening. sunnis willing to fight isis should be given control over their own affairs in northern iraq in the way that kurdish aspirations have been accommodated. the alternative, of relying on sectarian forces to drive out the extremists, is more likely to ensure their return than to prevent it. getting to a new political order in iraq that offers the prospect of sustainable stability and progress will require compromise, not only among iraqis but also among the regional sponsors of its contending factions -- iraq has become a key battleground in the regional struggle between camps led by iran and the saudis. creating a political order capable of stabilizing iraq will require a new security ""grand bargain"" negotiated between the key stakeholders. short-term tactical victories won't defeat isis, and militia involvement will more likely strengthen its appeal. the reality is that ultimately, only a political deal that guarantees iraqi sunnis' inclusion, equality and protection -- one that is implemented by iran and its allied iraqi militia -- can resolve the isis problem. and unless all of the key stakeholders are willing to negotiate a new way of living together, iraq is likely to remain a battleground where the united states finds itself inadvertently reinforcing the problem.",iraqi forces have been involved in an offensive to retake tikrit

"-- what was, in retrospect, most heroic about neil alden armstrong, who died saturday at age 82, was the manner in which he shied away from the spoils and trappings of heroism itself. being the first man on the moon, after all, would seem to place you on top of the world, providing a kind of lifetime pass to wherever you wanted to go -- and whatever you wanted to be. thinking of running for office? name the district, state or country and it's yours. maybe you'd like to go into business. the line of people with dotted lines to sign stretches from here to infinity. and so do their wallets. show biz? hmmm -- that's a tough one. you and bob hope weren't exactly magic together on that uso tour. but, well, we can make something happen, right? this is america, after all, and you are the greatest american hero! armstrong's one small step resonated for all mankind but armstrong, a native of wapakoneta, ohio, so steeped in flying that his idea of winding down was piloting gliders in his spare time, wanted exactly none of those options. having his choice of any possible future after leaving nasa in 1971, he chose to go back to his home state and teach aerospace engineering at the university of cincinnati. it was an unusual, but, by then, hardly surprising move by the laconic commander of apollo 11, the july 1969 mission that fulfilled president john f. kennedy's mandate for an american lunar landing within a decade. before, during and after that epochal journey, armstrong came across as something of an enigma to global media anxious to make him the brightest star on earth. this was going to be tough. rather than having the jaunty wit of a wally schirra, the affable magnetism of a john glenn or the flinty swagger of a chuck yeager, neil armstrong came across as nothing more than the earnest, no-nonsense engineer he actually was. no artifice, no flash, no -- well, frankly, no star power to speak of. within the fraternity of test pilots, however, armstrong was among the brightest of stars. before being chosen in 1962 as one of the ""group ii"" astronauts -- which included apollo 13 commander james lovell along with such legends as frank borman, pete conrad and john young -- armstrong was one of the elite pilots selected to fly the x-15 rocket plane up to five times the speed of sound and toward the edge of space. remembering neil armstrong and that no-nonsense demeanor served armstrong well in his work. as command pilot of the march 1966 gemini 8 mission, the first in which one spacecraft docked with another vehicle in orbit, armstrong showed cool composure when a malfunctioning thruster caused his two-man spacecraft to tumble end over end. his decision-making may have prematurely ended the mission, but it saved his life, co-pilot david scott's life, and possibly the whole american space program. and yet, all many people remembered about that flight was that its mishap pre-empted that night's broadcast of cbs's ""lost in space."" armstrong's seemingly casual reaction to peril left his nasa colleagues in awe when, in may 1968, he picked exactly the right time to eject from a lunar landing simulator that had spun out of control. his only injury was a bitten tongue sustained after parachuting to safety. he was back at his office, working, that same afternoon. few of these facts were widely known by the public when armstrong, along with buzz aldrin and michael collins, was picked for the lunar landing mission. all people knew about the astronaut who would turn out to be the first man on the moon was what they saw. and what they saw mystified them. in press conferences and interviews before the apollo 11 flight, armstrong spoke mostly in clipped, dry sentences, almost as if he were transmitting radio messages from a distance while still on earth. norman mailer, assigned by life magazine to cover the flight, found him in press conferences to be ""extraordinarily remote ... apparently in communion with some string in the universe others did not think to unravel."" even those famous first words upon stepping off the lunar module -- ""that's one small step for man. one giant leap for mankind."" -- resounded to a waiting world as tentative, fragmented; almost as if they had to be pulled from armstrong after a struggle. yet over the span of 40-plus years, those eleven words have achieved iconic stature in no small way because of the unassuming manner in which they were uttered. armstrong taught at cincinnati for eight years before leaving in 1979, characteristically without explanation. he was hardly a recluse afterward, though he maintained a relatively low profile; lower, anyway, than you'd expect for the first man on the moon. he sat on boards of banks and corporations and served on various commissions, including the one investigating the 1986 challenger disaster. (that panel included another space pioneer, sally ride, who died little more than a month ago.) obituaries 2012: the lives they've lived he was cautious about giving interviews and autographs, hawkish about the use of his name and of anything related to his apollo 11 mission. while his fellow apollo 11 moon-walker, buzz aldrin, seemed up for anything from ""dancing with the stars"" to ""transformers 3"" (and he's been a wry and inspirational figure to have on the scene), armstrong kept his distance from the media circus beyond authorizing a biography, ""first man: the life of neil a. armstrong,"" in 2005. if he raised his voice in public at all, it had only to do with space exploration and his growing sorrow over america's gradual withdrawal from taking the initiative in manned flight. still, by his ninth decade on planet earth, armstrong seemed to be more relaxed in public and generally more visible than he used to be. if anything, his time hugging the corners of fame made him seem even more admirable as a man who refused to sell himself or his legacy out, no matter what temptations were available in a celebrity-crazed culture. for one spellbinding week 43 summers ago, neil armstrong did something that once seemed unimaginable. since then, he lived his life in a way that now seems improbable. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of gene seymour.","gene seymour: neil armstrong was a star test pilot, cool and decisive under stress"
"-- authorities said friday that they will begin digging for evidence of graves at a california ranch that once was home to the infamous ""family"" of convicted killer charles manson. authorities said they will start digging at barker ranch, charles manson's hideout. soil testing to determine the possible presence of buried bodies was inconclusive, authorities said friday, so ""exploratory excavation"" will be done this month, inyo county sheriff bill lutze said. the dig will be carried out ""to either confirm or put to rest speculation that bodies may remain there from the charles manson era,"" lutze said in a written statement. in march, search crews found indications that human remains may lie within a few yards of barker ranch, the onetime hideout of the manson family. the sites were identified by trained dogs, and testing equipment from the oak ridge national laboratory also indicated the possible presence of remains, said sgt. paul dostie of the mammoth lakes, california, police department. the excavation will take place at sites where cadaver dogs gave mixed indications and soil testing was inconclusive, lutze said. ""there was no consistent response from the dogs that searched, and no conclusive findings from the soil samplings tested by top experts in the field,"" he said. ""therefore, i believe the only way to determine once and for all whether there are bodies buried at barker ranch from the time of the manson family is to proceed with limited excavation in a very few areas."" he said four methods of testing were used at five sites on the ranch. no site was identified by all four methods as possibly having remains, but positive findings by one method were corroborated by another at some of the sites, the sheriff's department said. the excavations will begin may 20 and continue through about may 23, although additional days will be added if needed, he said. barker ranch is national park service property and will be closed to the public during the excavation, the sheriff's department said. media access will be limited, but daily briefings will be provided. after dostie's dog and another dog, from necrosearch, a nonprofit organization that specializes in finding clandestine graves, indicated the possible presence of human remains, testing equipment from tennessee's oak ridge laboratory indicated two likely grave sites and a third possible grave site, dostie said. manson and four others were convicted of murder and other charges in connection with a two-night spree in august 1969 that included the slaying of actress sharon tate. the slayings -- and manson and his family members -- transfixed the nation. manson is serving a life sentence at california's corcoran state prison. cnn sent letters to him and to co-defendant ""tex"" watson, asking whether there were victims buried behind barker ranch. manson did not reply, but watson did, writing in a letter: ""i was the first family member to go to the desert after the murders and also the first to leave. i say this only to let you know that no one was killed while i was in the desert. but i don't know what took place after i left. i don't think there were any more killed, i hope not! i have absolutely nothing to hide."" cnn's ted rowlands contributed to this report.",new: digging to begin this month at old manson family ranch

""it is an honor for me to decorate and commemorate all the soldiers who died."" the cathedral at bayeux has a new bronze bell to mark the anniversary. local priest, father laurent berthout, said it celebrated ""peace and reconciliation between the different countries, and between france and germany, and the friendship between the united states and france and england."" but berthout said not all of those in normandy have completely positive memories of the liberation -- some can't forget how destructive it was. charles moncouteau, 87, told cnn his village never joins in the commemorations, because it was almost completely destroyed by the fighting. this year, french president francois hollande has ordered that attention be focused on the civilian losses as well as the military ones; it is estimated that, during the normandy campaign alone, 20,000 french civilians lost their lives. three-quarters of caen, where hollande and more than a dozen heads of state and government will gather this week, was destroyed by the fighting when german troops held out there in the months following d-day, prompting the allies to lay siege to the city. scars left by the conflict remain, 70 years later. but many of today's residents of normandy are simply grateful for the actions of those soldiers -- in some cases, decades before they were even born. ""my gratitude is huge,"" says law student paul guillotte. ""i am blessing every day the heroes who came to rescue us."" on june 6, others will say thank you in their own way. american jazz pianist bill carrothers will perform alongside more than 100 teenagers from schools across the u.s. and france, offering a musical tribute to those who fought in world war ii. ""it's a tiny and fairly insignificant way of giving back to a lot of veterans who went before us and died, fighting for an idea, a very important idea that i think some of the modern wars somewhat lost,"" he explained. ""the landings in normandy were an important moral event. it wasn't a war for oil, prestige or power. it was for an idea -- maybe the last time in our history that i can think of that it has been the case."" for decades since the war's end, harold bradley has declined to take part in events commemorating d-day. ""it isn't me,"" he explains. ""it's like wearing medals, you know. i don't want to walk up and down with medals on saying: 'look at me.'"" but this year, on the 70th anniversary of the decisive battle, bradley will be in normandy to pay tribute to those who fell, alongside other elderly veterans and world leaders. ""i am extremely fortunate to be as fit as well as i am, but obviously it can't last forever -- [i'm] 91 on june 9,"" he says. ""in so much as it could well be the last time, i shall go."" as one of the last remaining soldiers who can recall those bloody days in june 1944, he hopes that such battles remain firmly in the past. ""it would be a dream to say stop wars but at least reduce them, because at the end of a war what have you got? no-one's won anything. millions dead and you still have the same problem."" what to know about d-day d-day landings - myth and reality eisenhower's 'soul-racking' d-day decision","world leaders, veterans gather to mark 70th anniversary of d-day landings"
"(cnn) -- just what we need out of washington: more wind. but seriously, folks -- the white house took time out tuesday to plug what it called a success story ahead of president obama's state of the union address. citing a new report by the american wind energy association, obama spokesman robert gibbs said the administration's much-criticized economic stimulus bill turned what had been a projected decline in new wind electricity generation in 2009 to a sharp increase. gibbs said the association predicted the amount of new electricity produced by wind turbines would dip by 50 percent in 2009, compared to the capacity added in 2008. ""instead, this tax credit came through the recovery act, and we saw a 39 percent increase in the number of wind plants, wind power, generated over the course of last year,"" gibbs said. gibbs pointed to the administration's assistance to the renewable energy industry as an example of ""investments for the future."" did gibbs correctly characterize the report's findings? yes. but while the industry credits the stimulus bill with spurring new growth in 2009, it says the new growth hasn't necessarily translated into new jobs. the industry did add nearly 10,000 megawatts of generating capacity in 2009, ""shattering any expectations we had for the year, given the financial crisis,"" said elizabeth salerno, the awea's director of industry data and analysis. utilities had a strong first quarter of the year based on projects that were already in the works before the financial meltdown of 2008. but projects dried up quickly in mid-year, before about $1.9 billion in renewable energy tax credits from the stimulus bill began to kick in, salerno said. once the rules for qualifying for those credits were drafted, companies began using them to raise private capital and the year finished ""significantly stronger"" than expected, she said. ""that really is due to the recovery act."" wind power produced about 1.6 percent of the electricity used in the united states though october 2009, according to u.s. department of energy figures. that's up from about 1.25 percent in all of 2008, and the final figure for 2009 is likely to be close to 2 percent, salerno said. but while the wind projects produced new jobs for people installing and maintaining the new generating units, the stimulus funding ""doesn't necessarily translate to increases in manufacturing,"" salerno said. ""overall, we've had some gains and some losses,"" she said. ""i think we've been able to remain steady at about 85,000 jobs, which is about where we ended up at the end of 2008."" salerno said the industry will be closely watching obama's budget proposal, expected next week, for signs of continued support. ""manufacturing needs a much longer time horizon to make investments,"" she said. cnn's emma lacey-bordeaux contributed to this report.",white house spokesman says stimulus increased new wind electricity generation

"-- thanksgiving day 2008 shows where detroit has been. the detroit lions have played at home every thanksgiving since 1934. it is the city's greatest football tradition. yet instead of a source of great pride, the game had become an embarrassment, as well as representative of everything going horribly wrong in detroit. the auto industry melted down with alarming and unprecedented speed. the city of detroit was rife with political scandal that eventually put mayor kwame kilpatrick and several other prominent public officials behind bars. all this turmoil came while the lions were poised to be the only team in nfl history to go 0-16. the sentiment? the lions were viewed as incredible losers in the nfl landscape, so we must be incredible losers, too. however, the fans maintained their love for the team in spite of their obvious difficulties. the tennessee titans ended up thrashing the lions, 47-10. tennessee's defensive coordinator that day was jim schwartz. less than two months later, he was the lions' head coach. ""i don't remember much about the game other than we had our concerns about winning it, but i do recall the drive into the city."" schwartz said. ""you could just see and feel what was happening at the time. it was eye-opening."" that was in stark contrast to what is happening in detroit three years later. in 2011, the lions are 4-0 for the first time since 1980. their matchup monday night against chicago at ford field is perhaps the most anticipated football game the lions have played since they advanced to the nfc championship game in 1991. meanwhile on the mound in detroit, the tigers are also showing amazing promise. in a thrilling game, the tigers beat the new york yankees 3-2 on thursday to advance to the american league championship series. the tigers did capture the al pennant in 2006 -- eliminating the yankees -- but had been a high-payroll, low-achieving club since until this summer, when they ran away with the al central title. the pressure to deliver the division title this season was so intense that on the night the tigers clinched, tears welled in manager jim leyland's eyes as he was interviewed by fox sports detroit team broadcaster mario impemba. ""at times like this, sports teams can lift the spirits of their fans,"" leyland said, his voice cracking. ""i hope we uplifted their spirits, because they deserved it."" at this moment in detroit, it seems like both teams, the lions and tigers, are lifting each other's as well as this city's spirits. ""we're all allies,"" leyland said. ""we're pulling for one and another. good atmosphere for the city. makes people forget about their troubles with good times with sports."" the success of the lions and tigers has hardly made the city's problems go away.the 2010 census numbers revealed that detroit's population dropped to 713,777. detroit had once been the nation's fourth largest city, with more than 1.8 million people. michigan was the only state in the nation to have a net loss in population since the 2000 census. there are entire blocks of detroit that are nothing but vacant houses. violence is also a major issue. in one 24-hour period on an august weekend, 16 people were shot and seven killed. yet there are some signs of hope in the economy. the auto industry seems to be doing better. ford motor co. stock is up nearly 11 times its value at the depths of the meltdown, while general motors is trading publicly again and reporting profits. chrysler is reportedly turning a profit, too, and is still reaping the benefits from its super bowl commercial featuring detroit's own eminem. the ad references ""hard work, conviction and a know-how that runs generations deep in every last one of us."" it seems to sum up the feelings of pride in spite of circumstance felt by the residents of the state. history has shown that when the city's sports teams start doing well, it's a sign of healing in detroit. in 1968, when the tigers won the world series, it brought a racially divided region together after race riots. in 1984, the local economy rebounded from the recession at the same time the tigers again won the world series. what makes 2011 different? the tigers' magical summer is being followed by a surprisingly solid performance from the usually underperforming lions, behind a triple threat of quarterback matthew stafford, wide receiver calvin johnson and defensive tackle ndamukong suh. it's not just that the lions are winning but how they're doing it. they were down 20 points against the minnesota vikings on the road september 25 and then, the following sunday, down 24 points against the cowboys on the road. the lions won both games, representing the city's come-from-behind spirit and fight to win in the midst of adversity. this tenacity is not lost on schwartz, the coach, who has seen the lions at their worst and now their best. ""when i became the lions coach, it didn't take me long to understand what the team means to the people here,"" schwartz said. ""no matter how bad it has been, they have never stopped caring. they are vocal but never apathetic. it's like a lawn that has been dormant. it just takes one good watering, and it's back."" eminem's tag line in january's chrysler ad -- ""that's who we are. that's our story"" -- sums up the motivation for these teams who know that the wins are helping detroit's image and giving residents a sense of hope and pride that's been missing. it seems that detroit is back -- for now.","detroit had once been fourth largest u.s. city, with more than 1.8 million people"
"-- for years, connie and daniel roddy did all they could to support livestrong, raising tens of thousands of dollars for the cancer charity founded by cyclist lance armstrong. ""it all started when lance's first book came out,"" connie roddy said, referring to the 2001 publication of ""it's not about the bike: my journey back to life,"" which details armstrong's bout with testicular cancer. ""i read it cover to cover. i was just so taken by who he said he was."" the roddys, who live in santa monica, california, say they initially gave $50,000 to the foundation. in 2003, connie roddy said, she helped organize an event for the foundation at a health club that raised an additional $150,000. now they want their money back. ""i feel we were really fooled. we were really hoodwinked,"" she said. their concern comes in the wake of last week's finding by the u.s. anti-doping agency of ""overwhelming"" evidence that armstrong was involved as a professional cyclist in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program."" doping scandal costs lance armstrong sponsors, charity role armstrong stepped down as chairman of livestrong this week and has lost endorsement deals with nike and anheuser-busch. the seven-time tour de france winner, who never failed a drug test, has consistently denied the allegations. armstrong has not addressed the findings but has instead urged his supporters to continue fighting cancer. ""the mission absolutely must go on,"" he said friday night at the organization's 15th anniversary celebration in austin, texas. ""we will not be deterred. we will move forward, and we will continue to serve the 28 million people around the world that need us the most."" the sport's governing body, the international cycling union, has said it will respond monday to the doping dossier compiled by the usada amid calls for armstrong to be stripped of his seven tour de france titles. the international olympic committee also is reviewing the evidence and could revoke armstrong's bronze medal from the 2000 sydney games. but dutch bank rabobank was not awaiting any further review. it announced friday that, after 17 years of sponsoring professional cycling teams, it will end its program at the end of the year. dutch bank pulls out as pro cycling sponsor ""it is with pain in our heart, but for the bank this is an inevitable decision,"" said bert bruggink of rabobank's managing board. ""we are no longer convinced that the international professional world of cycling can make this a clean and fair sport. we are not confident that this will change for the better in the foreseeable future."" rabobank said it had previously seen elite cycling as a good fit with the company, its clients and its employees. but that has changed since the usada report alleging doping by armstrong and others. its decision drew a sharp response on twitter from british cyclist david millar, who rides for the garmin-sharp team: ""dear rabobank, you were part of the problem. how dare you walk away from your young clean guys who are part of the solution. sickening."" the bank's decision was a blow to the rabobank cycling team, according to its general manager, harold knebel. but other sponsors are sticking by the team, which will try to rebuild under a new name, he said. ""this industry can only survive with big international firms, and the way the sponsors now are responding to this situation is certainly not good,"" knebel said. ""if we want to stay in cycling and grow cycling on the world scale, then something has to be done."" livestrong bracelet: to wear or not to wear? but criticism poured in from some of the charity's donors. former livestrong donor michael birdsong of salt lake city is among them. ""the charity was established and publicized and got their funds based on a fraud,"" he said. birdsong said he was attracted to the organization after his wife -- an avid cyclist -- was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998, about the time armstrong won his first tour de france title. ""she found his story very inspiring,"" he said. ""before we read his book, she would work all day, go to radiation treatments and go riding because that made her feel good."" in 2007, the couple ""became part of the public face of the foundation,"" said birdsong, a software engineer. ""i was one of the people who would answer questions from people to raise money."" though he had long been aware of armstrong's alleged drug use, he said he didn't believe it. ""i was a huge armstrong fan from 1999 to the time he retired; i would defend him from anyone."" evidence of armstrong doping 'overwhelming,' agency says but, as his involvement with livestrong grew, ""i started to ask what are they doing with all this money they are raising?"" the foundation's irs filing last year reported more than $100 million in net assets or fund balances. the organization spent $2.1 million in compensation to its seven highest-paid officers and three employees, according to the irs form. no member of the board, whose members include cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta, was compensated, it said. now, birdsong said, he feels disillusioned. ""the whole thing is founded on a lie. the guy cheated, and he forced other people to cheat. i would like my money back. we donated under false pretenses."" livestrong spokeswoman katherine mclane responded saturday by reassuring donors that the charity has always been dedicated to the highest standards of the nonprofit world. ""they chose to support not a single person, but a cause that benefits millions of people throughout the united states and throughout the world,"" mclane told cnn. ""they put their trust in livestrong, one of america's top-rated cancer charities, and we can assure them that their trust was not misplaced."" mclane said 82% of funds raised by the lance armstrong foundation, the charity's official name, are devoted to programs and services that benefit survivors and their families. livestrong has actually seen an increase in donations and purchases from the its online store in recent weeks, mclane said. purchases from the store, which sells livestrong's trademark yellow wristbands, sports apparel and accessories, have doubled in the past three days, she said. ""it's something the foundation is incredibly grateful for, and we take that as a sign that people, even in troubled economic times, value the free services that livestrong provides cancer survivors and their families."" bob kile of kent, washington, said he is unfazed by the armstrong controversy. the 65-year-old throat cancer survivor he has no plans to remove the yellow bracelet that identifies him as a donor to the foundation. highlights of the armstrong report ""if lance doped, that certainly takes away from his athletic wins,"" kile said. ""however, to survive what he did and come back at all is impressive. to come back and create good like he did with livestrong is even better."" actor sean penn expressed a similar view on friday night, as he entered the austin convention center for the anniversary event. ""of course he remains an inspiration,"" penn said in response to a reporter's question. ""i think anybody who's looking with a very clear eye at this would find themselves very hypocritical to consider otherwise."" the editor-in-chief of bicycling magazine, peter flax, told hlntv.com that he thinks the scandal would have an effect in the short term but that people should understand that cycling has already made moves to clean up its act. ""the next year or two will be difficult and pivotal years for the sport. people need to understand that the sport is way cleaner than it used to be -- far cleaner and more transparent than most other elite sports,"" he said. with armstrong's disgrace, will anything change? cnn's tom watkins, laura smith-spark, scott zamost, alex thomas and emanuella grinberg, and hln's anna lanfreschi contributed to this report.",new: lance armstrong urges his supporters to continue fighting cancer

"-- as criminal attorneys, we know that tragic cases very often bring festering social issues into public view. bill cosby was right: the trayvon martin case brings to the surface troubling questions not only about race but also about the role of handguns in our society. now that the shooter, george zimmerman, has been charged with second-degree murder, his defense under florida's ""stand your ground"" law will become the focus of discussion. this law is grounded in a factual error and a deeply flawed principle. the factual error is that a proliferation of handguns makes us safer. the flawed principle is that somehow the right to bear arms needs to be enlarged to a right to resolve disputes with guns. the notion that guns make us safer is a fallacy. people with guns in their homes are much more likely to be killed with their own gun -- by accident, domestic violence or suicide -- than to use it ever against an intruder, according to arthur kellermann, writing in the new england journal of medicine. similarly, people who carry guns are more likely to be shot and killed than those who are unarmed. a university of pennsylvania study found that people carrying guns were 4.5 times more likely to be shot and 4.2 times more likely to be killed. that study's author, charles branas, has speculated that one reason may be that guns give carriers a sense of empowerment that causes them to overreact in tense situations. that may be precisely what happened in the case of zimmerman. florida's stand your ground law changed the previous understanding of self-defense in a simple way. traditionally, one could only claim self-defense if there was no reasonable chance to retreat from a situation where one felt threatened. the revised law says if you feel threatened with imminent great bodily harm, you may use force, including guns, against the person you find threatening, even if there is a reasonable opportunity to retreat. what this invites is the settling of personal disputes with guns, as evidenced by a 300% increase in the number of killings by private citizens justified by ""self-defense"" in florida since the law passed. most murders involve young men, often as both shooter and victim, as in the trayvon martin case. young men, of course, often get in conflicts where they are threatening one another: that is, where both of them are trying to scare the other with ""imminent great bodily harm."" florida's law may allow one of those chest-bumping young men, without consequence, to end the mutual dispute by shooting the other dead on the street. when it is over, the only witness may be the shooter, and his version of events will presumptively control. there is no morality in this rule. nothing in our constitution even vaguely promotes the redress of grievances with guns; the ""redress of grievances"" clause of the first amendment has nothing to with the ""right to bear arms"" described in the second amendment. rather, what the constitution protects is the ability to redress our grievances by petitioning our government. there may be no more damning indictment of our society than this: we too often seem to be equipping our young men with the guns and excuses to kill one another, rather than the safe schools and knowledge it takes to frame a good and righteous petition. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","writers: ""right to bear arms"" does not include a right to use guns in disputes"
"-- for 50 years the environmental movement has unsuccessfully argued that we should save the planet for moral reasons, that there were more important things than money. ironically, it now seems it will be money -- through the economic impact of climate change and resource constraint -- that will motivate the sweeping changes necessary to avert catastrophe. the reason is we have now reached a moment where four words -- the earth is full -- will define our times. this is not a philosophical statement; this is just science based in physics, chemistry and biology. there are many science-based analyses of this, but they all draw the same conclusion -- that we're living beyond our means. the eminent scientists of the global footprint network, for example, calculate that we need about 1.5 earths to sustain this economy. in other words, to keep operating at our current level, we need 50% more earth than we've got. watch paul gilding's ted talk in financial terms, this would be like always spending 50% more than you earn, going further into debt every year. but of course, you can't borrow natural resources, so we're burning through our capital, or stealing from the future. while they use different words, leaders and experts around the world are acknowledging this. chinese environment minister zhou shengxian said last year, ""the depletion, deterioration and exhaustion of resources and the worsening ecological environment have become bottlenecks and grave impediments to (our) economic and social development."" if i had said that in the '90s, when i was the global head of greenpeace, it would have been dismissed as doom-and-gloom extremism! ted.com: how we wrecked the ocean even the previous heresy, that economic growth has limits, is on the table. belief in infinite growth on a finite planet was always irrational, but it is the nature of denial to ignore hard evidence. now denial is evaporating, even in the financial markets. as influential fund manager jeremy grantham of gmo says: ""the fact is that no compound growth is sustainable. if we maintain our desperate focus on growth, we will run out of everything and crash."" or as peak oil expert richard heinberg argues, we are moving beyond peak oil and into ""peak everything."" despite this emerging understanding, the growth concept is so deeply ingrained in our thinking that we will keep pushing economic growth as hard as we can, at whatever cost is required. as a result, the crisis will be big, it will be soon, and it will be economic, not environmental. the fact is the planet will take further bludgeoning, further depleting its capital, but the economy cannot -- so we'll respond not because the environment is under great threat, but because the science and economics shows that something far more important to us is jeopardized -- economic growth. ted.com: the biggest health threat facing women a good indicator is that, despite the recession of the past few years, oil and food prices are approaching record highs again, driven by underlying, long-term trends that even a recession can't slow down. grantham calls this ""the most important economic event since the industrial revolution.""â if serious growth returns, the resulting resource price spikes, particularly oil and food, will soon kill it again. as a result, what we are facing is not a few bad years of slow growth like this past recession, but a fundamental shift -- the end of cheap resources and an environment in a state of collapse. even normally cautious bodies like the international energy agency and the organisation for economic co-operation and development are sounding the alarm, with the latter recently releasing a comprehensive report forecasting a world in 2050 that will be defined by resource constraint and its economic impacts. they even dare to ask: ""will the growth process undermine itself?"" ted.com: peter diamandis says abundance is our future so when this crisis hits, will we respond or will we simply slide into collapse? crisis elicits a powerful human response, whether it be personal health, natural disaster, corporate crisis or national threat. previously immovable barriers to change quickly disappear. in this case, the crisis will be global and will manifest as the end of economic growth, thereby striking at the very heart of our model of human progress. while that will make the task of ending denial harder, it also means what's at risk is, quite simply, everything we hold to be important. the last time this happened was world war ii, and our response to that is illustrative of both the denial and delay process and the likely form our response to this crisis will take. ted.com: the global power shift when we look at history we tend to see the progress of events as inevitable, but it was rarely so at the time. indeed, the uk's powerful response to hitler and the united states' equally extraordinary mobilization after pearl harbor both followed long years of denial and debate. many argued that the threat wasn't that great, the response would be too expensive to afford, the public wouldn't support it. sound familiar? but when the response came, when the scale of the threat was finally accepted, our response was breathtaking. as churchill told his country: ""it is no use saying, 'we are doing our best.' you have got to succeed in doing what is necessary."" with denial gone, governments knew what was ""necessary."" they directed industry to support the war -- banning civilian auto production just four days after pearl harbor. they raised massive amounts of money to fund investment and technology research at an extraordinary scale -- indeed, u.s. spending on the war rose from 1.6% of gdp in 1940 to 37% just five years later. to achieve this, they curtailed personal consumption and drove remarkable behavior change to free up financial and other resources for the war effort. do you find this hard to imagine today? then try to imagine the alternative -- that in a collapsing global economy and society we will stand by and simply watch the slide. there is no precedent in modern history on which to base that conclusion and plenty of evidence for the alternative. humanity may be slow, but we are not stupid. get ready for the great disruption. â the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of paul gilding.",paul gilding: the demands we place on the environment far exceed its capacity

"-- modern u.s. presidents seem to be in need of neat, catchy labels for the enemy they want to destroy. ""network of death"" is the latest one. after u.s. president barack obama's speech at the united nations, we now know that it is this network that needs ""dismantling."" whether or not this new label will help increase the number of countries willing to join the u.s. in the fight against isis remains to be seen. old, trusted allies will doubtless follow. britain's prime minister david cameron has already vowed that his country will ""play its part."" all cameron needs is parliamentary approval, which is expected friday -- and maybe his own new label for isis. but how will the ""network"" react? how will it strike back? it is of course difficult to see how isis could successfully resist u.s. air power in the long run. yet this conflict is first and foremost a political confrontation. the many wars in the middle east since 9/11 have shown that messages matter. and in this regard the isis ""network"" is bound to continue to do just fine. this is not so much because isis and its supporters have created media arms like those radical islamic groups al-furqan or al-hayat. nor has it much to do with the ability to spread their videos by using twitter-bots or multiple youtube accounts, clever hashtags, mobile phone apps or more obscure social media sites to evade counter-measures by police and security agencies. it has all to do with the message itself. if it resonates, it will spread. goaded into action? isis has already portrayed the mere fact that obama has decided to use military force as a success. groups like isis crave recognition. acknowledging them as a major threat -- and taking counter-measures -- does just that. it guarantees extensive coverage in traditional media. isis' first reaction after the start of the bombardments was to point out that obama, like george bush before him, was drawn into a conflict that he could not win. isis got what it wanted -- a direct confrontation with the us and an opportunity to link obama to the widely discredited military strategy of his successor. provoking and unsettling is a major part of isis media strategy. the group knows western audiences as well as local and regional ones. hostages are shown in the familiar guantanamo-style orange jump suits: ""what you did to us, we can do to you,"" is the simple message. not new, but tried, tested and successful, particularly with local audiences. recruiting western muslims most unsettling to western audiences is that disaffected muslims from their own nations are drawn to join the conflict. it is hardly necessary for the isis leadership to threaten retaliation in western countries. a few more posts, pictures or videos featuring isis fighters with french, british or german voices are sufficient to scare western politicians and their respective electorates. they might even provoke counter-measures like stricter border controls, passport restrictions and increased surveillance. they might also lead to new types of profiling, which may well backfire and encourage yet more young men to travel to syria to take up the fight for the self-proclaimed islamic state, as isis has proclaimed itself to be. western counter-messages and social media offences will hardly prevent this. so in essence, it is as simple as to keep doing what isis media people are already doing. merely resisting u.s. military pressure as long as possible will strengthen isis's message. as will the potentially devastating consequences of u.s., french or british bombing raids on civilian populations. adding variety adding a few videos of successful isis attacks or evidence of dogged resistance will also help. hostage videos alone will lose their impact over time, however gruesome they are. a little variation is needed. the new ""lecture series"" of british hostage john cantlie shows that isis is aware of that. whether obama's ""network of death"" is the appropriate phrase or not, it is certainly true that isis and affiliates form a network. but even if isis were to become seriously ""degraded,"" it is difficult to believe that the whole network can be dismantled. at the heart of the current turmoil in the middle east is a civil war within islam. being regarded as the one force that stands up to u.s. and western military power is bound to boost isis's reputation in this struggle. the media prominence isis has achieved is also bound to encourage other groups to embark on similar ""media work."" the ""network of death"" is in an excellent position to continue to create isis-style media messages. the video of the beheading of french mountain guide herve gourdel, posted by the algerian isis affiliate on wednesday, is only the most recent example.","isis has goaded u.s. president barack obama into reacting, writes peter busch"

"(cnn) -- moments after president obama said a ""mix of human and systemic failures"" allowed a man to try to bomb a passenger jet on christmas day, federal agencies said they had done all they could. ""a systemic failure has occurred, and i consider that totally unacceptable,"" obama told reporters tuesday during his vacation in hawaii, referring to what authorities allege was umar farouk abdulmutallab's failed attempt to blow up a northwest airlines plane preparing to land in detroit, michigan. the president said information on abdulmutallab should have sufficed to alert authorities to prevent him from getting on the flight from amsterdam, netherlands. ""what already is apparent is that there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security,"" obama said. ""we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake."" federal authorities have charged abdulmutallab, 23, of nigeria, with trying to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight made its final approach. the device failed to fully detonate, instead setting off a fire at his seat. obama has ordered preliminary results of an investigation into what went wrong by thursday. however, the president said u.s. intelligence officials had received information signaling abdulmutallab might be a terrorism threat but failed to take steps to prevent the man from boarding the flight. ""it's been widely reported that the father of the suspect in the christmas incident warned u.s. officials in africa about his son's extremist views,"" obama said. ""it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect's name on a no-fly list."" obama cited ""other deficiencies,"" saying ""there were bits of information available within the intelligence community that could have and should have been pieced together."" the airport security system created after the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the united states was ""not sufficiently up to date to take full advantage of the information we collect and knowledge we have,"" obama said. ""had this critical information been shared, it could have been compiled with other intelligence, and a fuller, clearer picture of the suspect would have emerged,"" obama said. ""the warning signs would have triggered red flags, and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for america."" obama said that the inability to take proper action on ""information on a known extremist"" showed the system had failed. soon after obama delivered his remarks, a reliable source told cnn's jeanne meserve that abdulmutallab's father talked twice about his son's extremist views with at least one cia representative at the u.s. embassy in nigeria and a report was prepared, but the report was not circulated outside the agency. u.s. officials said the father, a former nigerian banker, expressed his concerns about his son's radicalization during two meetings and more than one telephone call with embassy officials. the information was sent to cia headquarters in langley, virginia, but sat there for five weeks and was not disseminated until after the christmas day incident, the source said. had that information been shared, the man might have been denied passage on the flight, the source said. an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the federal government had information that, meshed with other information, ""would have allowed us to disrupt the attempted terrorist attack"" before the suspect boarded the jet at schiphol airport in amsterdam. ""what we have here is a situation in which the failings were individual, organizational, systemic and technological,"" the official said. ""we ended up in a situation where a single point of failure in the system put our security at risk, where human error was compounded by systemic deficiencies in a way that we cannot allow to continue."" but a u.s. intelligence official said that the son's name, passport number and possible connection to extremists were indeed disseminated. the official said abdulmutallab's father never said his son was a planning an attack. ""the old man wanted help finding his kid,"" the intelligence official said. ""if he thought he was a bona fide terrorist, and he wanted him back, the embassy in nigeria would have been the last place to go. the u.s. doesn't send terrorists home, no questions asked. i'm not aware of anything that suddenly would have lit up the board and flagged abdulmutallab ... as a terrorist on his way to america. but it's the season for second-guessing, so anything goes."" the official added, ""i'm not aware of a magic piece of intelligence -- somehow withheld -- that would have put abdulmutallab on the no-fly list."" cia spokesman george little defended the agency's actions regarding abdulmutallab. ""we learned of him in november, when his father came to the u.s. embassy in nigeria and sought help in finding him,"" little said. ""we did not have his name before then. also in november, we worked with the embassy to ensure he was in the government's terrorist database -- including mention of his possible extremist connections in yemen. we also forwarded key biographical information about him to the national counterterrorism center."" little said the agency is reviewing data to ascertain whether more could have been done. state department spokesman ian kelly said department staff did what they were supposed to have done by sending a cable to the national counterterrorism center in washington about the matter. kelly said any decision to have revoked the suspect's visa would have been an interagency decision. but a u.s. government official said the information in the cable offered nothing specific and was just one of hundreds of such reports that the center evaluates daily. meanwhile, in the yemeni capital of sanaa, authorities were questioning congregants at a mosque and students and faculty at a school attended by abdulmutallab, the spokesman for yemen's embassy to the united states said tuesday. mohammed al-basha told cnn's ""the situation room"" that an assertion by the local al qaeda group that abdulmutallab's action was in retaliation for airstrikes against them was ""unfounded"" and ""most likely"" propaganda, but left open the possibility links could emerge. ""i think the al qaeda statement that came out recently saying that this is an attack in retaliation for what happened the 17th and 24th of december is unfounded, because we know that he bought the ticket a few days before that,"" al-basha said. abdulmutallab bought his ticket from lagos, nigeria, to detroit, michigan, via amsterdam on the day before the december 17 airstrike, nigerian officials said. conversations with the suspect's former acquaintances have turned up no link to al qaeda, al-basha said. ""umar, according to the questionings carried on today by his classmates and administrative officials of the school, he was a friendly person and did not ring any alarm bells,"" he said. but senior obama administration officials said tuesday they are starting to see a link to the terrorist group. ""some of the new information that we developed overnight does suggest that there was some linkage there,"" one of the senior administration officials said. the senior administration official was referring to intelligence that white house officials obtained late monday and then briefed obama about on tuesday in a secure conference call. al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed responsibility for the failed bombing, calling it retaliation for what it said were u.s. airstrikes on yemeni soil. al-basha said airstrikes launched against aqap on december 17 and december 24 were launched solely by the yemeni government, but acknowledged the united states has provided assistance since the september 11, 2001, attacks. u.s. officials say they have provided intelligence on aqap targets to yemen's government, but won't say whether u.s. aircraft or drones have taken part in strikes.",new: source: cia had report on abdulmutallab weeks before bombing attempt
"-- until the abduction of more than 200 girls at the government girls secondary school in rural chibok, nigeria's boko haram insurgency received scant attention in the global media, which gave it brief airtime when the insurgents exploded their bombs or torched a school. however, the mass abduction has brought the world's attention to the callous and unceasing violence that has become routine in northern nigeria over the last three years. the area has suffered more than three decades of religious violence between muslims and christians. but since boko haram founder mohammed yusuf was killed in a 2009 security crackdown -- along with hundreds of his followers -- the militant islamist group has stepped up its attacks. boko haram militants have killed clerics, bombed churches and mosques and assassinated politicians and government officials. when the militants attack churches, their aim is to start a sectarian war that will engulf the country; when they attack mosques, their aim is to exterminate muslims they consider collaborators. in the last three years, the nigerian government has opted for the use of force to exterminate the insurgents, rather than diminish the activities of the group -- and it has become more daring and audacious in its attacks. despite the allocation of 25% of the annual budget to defense and security, the government has been unable to crush and contain the insurgency. the group has taken on and demoralized the rank and file of the nigerian army and police. boko haram has launched deadly raids on military garrisons and police and secret intelligence offices to free their detained members. the use of force against the group has only led to allegations of a chain of rights abuses with the justification that it is a war on terror. nigeria's human rights commission last year accused the military of arbitrary killings, torture and rape in its campaign, while the military has described reports of civilian casualties as ""grossly exaggerated."" our constitutional freedom has been formally suppressed by the authorities on the grounds of national emergency. the strategy of collective punishment, arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention and killing raids by the security forces has alienated the civil populace and turned them into victims. in the war against boko haram, civilians have become victims of both the military and the militants. meeting with boko haram i mooted the idea of dialogue with the insurgents as a new option towards ending the insurgency and restoring peace to my bewildered and beleaguered nation. in september 2011, i facilitated talks with the insurgents and the former nigerian president olusegun obasanjo -- then chairman of nigeria's ruling party. read more: swap prisoners for kidnapped nigerian schoolgirls, ex-negotiator says the first surprise in the encounter was that the representatives of the terror group spoke fluent english. the bigger surprise was when some of the insurgents revealed that they had university degrees. it is a prerequisite for new boko haram members to burn their university certificates or any paper identification that links them secular schools. in the meeting, they justified their violence on the grounds that it was the nigerian government that had forced them to take up arms. they said that before they trod the path of violence, they first tried to take the path of peace. they even showed us copies of a petition they wrote to the government complaining about the harassment and intimidation of their sect members by security forces before they picked up arms. they showed us photographs of followers and relatives they said had been killed by the police in cold blood, even before the insurgency began and threatened more attacks until they ""avenge the injustices done to them."" they expressed anger at the way people criticized and condemned them when they launched attacks but kept mute when boko haram members were killed, their homes demolished and their wives and children arrested by the security forces. we took their grievances to the government and advised the government to follow through, but hawks within the corridors of power discouraged the president from taking our advice. the second effort at dialogue involved a northern islamic cleric and head of the nigeria sharia council. the talks were facilitated by a freelance journalist who was later threatened by those opposed to dialogue. this second round of dialogue took place in the last quarter of 2012. boko haram accused the government of leaking the details of the talks to the media for political reasons. one of the group's conditions for talks had been that only their outcome be made public. we were close to achieving a ceasefire but again hawks, security and defense contractors in the corridors of power sabotaged our efforts. i have never met the boko haram leader abubakar shekau but i declined to meet him on two occasions when i got his invitation to interview him. i declined because i realized that the government was not interested in my approach. 'preventable and avoidable' the abduction of the girls in chibok is one of many abductions over the last three years. if the nigerian authorities took lessons from earlier attacks on schools by the insurgents, the chibok abductions couldn't have happened. the chibok abduction was a preventable and avoidable tragedy. when the militants abduct boys, they use them as conscripts and girls as cooks and hostages. i cannot confirm if they used abducted girls as sex slaves -- the leadership of the group denied such reports when we asked them, but abducted women who were later freed give credence to such claims. each day the chibok girls spend in captivity keeps the moral flag of my country at half mast. the #bringbackourgirls protest and the interest shown by president obama and other world leaders and celebrities like alicia keys and angelina jolie has kept the spirits of chibok mothers high and the nigerian government on its toes. when we were children, we used to forecast that one day the sambisa forest in borno state would become a game reserve which would attract foreign tourists and foreign currencies. today it is attracting foreign interest for negative reasons. the chibok girls must be freed but not by the use of force except when other options fail. the schoolgirls are now innocent hostages in the hands of soulless gunmen. we don't want the body of the girls to be brought back home, we want them back home alive. political future the use of force could turn out to be tragic. experience has shown that attempts in the past to free hostages from the insurgents through the use of force has deadly consequences. french hostages were freed in nigeria through negotiations but a british and italian hostage were killed in sokoto when uk forces went to free them. we can get the chibok girls back home and we must. i was delighted to learn that the special team sent by the u.s. and uk also included experts in hostage negotiation. i strongly believe that islamic clerics in northern nigeria and some of the top ranking insurgents currently in detention can be used to open a channel of communication with the leadership of the sect in order to secure the release of the chibok girls. there are those who say that the option of negotiating to free the hostages will embolden the terrorists, i have never been a hostage but i have been a political prisoner who spent many years in prison during our struggle against military dictatorship in nigeria in the 1990s. those who experience captivity appreciate freedom the most. the situation we find ourselves in is a tough moment in our history, but i believe we shall overcome it. many nigerians believe that the way the chibok issue is resolved will determine the political future of nigeria. opinion: nigerians right to be wary of u.s. intentions the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of shehu sani.","global media paid boko haram little attention until 200 girls were abducted, says shehu sani"
"-- the world knows north korea for its loud and over-the-top warmongering rhetoric about the u.s. but the true war is being fought in whispers, across secret phone lines and smuggled radios. and it's those whispers that reveal how close the peninsula may be to an actual war. ""north koreans want to go to war soon and unite the country. they want to get out of their difficult lives through war,"" said kim seong min, with free north korea radio. ""north koreans are not getting any information from the outside world. they think they will win if a war breaks out."" kim is a foot soldier in the propaganda war. he hopes to turn north korea's people against the regime, broadcasting a message of democracy over the radio. he records commentaries and news bulletins that are blasted over a shortwave radio frequency. in his job, he speaks to paid sources who slip him information via chinese mobile phones at the border. he also has sources within the elite pyongyang military ranks. kim says the angry war rhetoric is a product of kim jong un's weak standing as a new leader. ""kim jong un is not even 30 years old and everyone in north korea knows this. he also doesn't have a solid position within the army. north koreans are also not sure how to handle the fact that their leader is so young."" that's similar to what defectors are telling the daily nk, an online news site based in seoul funded by a u.s. endowment. the daily nk also has sources within the military elite and the general north korean population. ""the sources we're hearing from are exhausted with the drills and the mobilization of the masses. some feel nationalistic pride that comes with the rhetoric out of north korea. at the same time, they're aware of the stagnant economy on the decline and the real need for change and opening,"" says daily nk's gregory pence. pence is a chicago native who came to seoul as a fulbright scholar. he stayed to work on the mission of opening up north korea's human rights abuses to the international community. pence says opinions at the daily nk, which is staffed with north korean defectors, vary. but many at the publication fear that poor decisions can be made in times of fear. what will hold back war, pence believes, is regime preservation. ""north korea risks outright annihilation. if a war broke out and escalated, it would cost the peninsula, the world,"" pence adds.

"-- five things learned from sunday's gop debate: everybody gets their follow-up there's been a lot of grousing about the back-to-back debate schedule but, in fact, the candidates seemed to relish the chance to follow up on their performances saturday night. both rick santorum and newt gingrich were panned for failing to land a blow on mitt romney saturday. that changed within the opening minutes of monday's match-up, with both candidates moving aggressively against romney right out of the gate. meanwhile, jon huntsman had clearly been thinking about romney's saturday criticism of his service as ambassador to china under president barack obama. huntsman took the opportunity to respond sunday. ""i was criticized last night by gov. romney for putting my country first,"" he said. ""i will always put my country first. i think that's important."" the one candidate clearly put to a disadvantage by the opportunity to fix saturday night's mistakes: romney, the longtime front-runner who skated through the first debate untouched and who is hoping to maintain the status quo days before new hampshire voters head to the polls. looking ahead to the general election? as in saturday's debate, gay rights once again played a role in this one. rick santorum -- a man who has run on a predominantly social values platform -- offered perhaps his strongest statement of homosexual support to date, saying he would not repudiate a son who told him he was gay. he was careful, however, not to say that he would fight for gay individuals, instead saying he would be an advocate for ""every person in america"" and would make sure people are treated with ""respect and dignity."" ""that does not mean that i would agree with certain things that the gay community would like to do to change laws, with respect to marriage, with respect to adoption and things like that,"" he said. on the same topic, mitt romney said he has hired gay staffers in the past and would never discriminate against gays or attempt to take away their rights. are these two men looking ahead to a general election, where strong social conservative values may not play as well on a national scale? perhaps. over the past few years the lgbt (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) rights movement has made strides, and many question whether someone who is not pro-lgbt could win a general election in the united states in 2012. that said, social issues played a big role in iowa, and will do so again in south carolina. santorum's answer may have been a good middle-of-the-road response, and a reminder of a phrase often used by christian conservatives: love the sinner, not the sin. that may be a message to which conservative voters in the upcoming state of south carolina can relate. dealing with democrats calls for bipartisanship at a gop presidential debate? could it be? both former house speaker newt gingrich and former massachusetts gov. mitt romney touted their records of working with democrats to hammer out legislative deals. gingrich, who is best know for battling president bill clinton in the 1990s, highlighted that he struck deals with the democratic president, even though he wanted to make him ""a one-term president."" and romney noted that when he was running massachusetts, the state legislature was 85% democratic, but that he found ""common ground,"" adding that he's proven that he can ""work with republicans and democrats who are willing to work together."" rick santorum touted his ability to gain support among voters of both parties in his former pennsylvania district, and huntsman said serving one's country should always trump party loyalty. but before candidates can work on uniting the party, they will have to triumph over their rivals as the bruising gop primary plays out this winter. huntsman's last stand? since former utah gov. jon huntsman is placing all his chips on a strong finish in new hampshire's tuesday primary, this weekend's two presidential debates were his last, best chance to make his case for the gop nomination. saturday's lukewarm performance by huntsman, who has failed to gain much traction in the polls, was followed by a stronger delivery on sunday morning. after coming under attack saturday night by bitter rival mitt romney for his service as u.s. ambassador to china during the first two years of president barack obama's term, huntsman sunday strongly defended his time in beijing. but he also highlighted his fiscal plans as in tune with conservative republican principles. and in a state where independent voters could determine who wins the primary, huntsman made his pitch, saying ""the american people are tired of the partisan division. they have had enough. and i say, we've had enough, and we have to change our direction in terms of coming together as americans first and foremost and finding solutions to our problems."" no one taking super pac high road gingrich finally had his face-off with romney over super pac ads that have been a negative undercurrent in the 2012 race. both candidates ignored a question sunday about whether they would agree to urge super pacs supporting their candidacy to take down negative advertisements. it became clear, as long as the claims in the influential ads are factually accurate, neither gingrich nor romney is above letting the groups do their mudslinging for them. gingrich, the former speaker who has been the target of a majority of the negative super pac ads, endorsed an upcoming movie-length spot about romney and his work with venture capital firm bain capital. ""i agree with (romney), it takes broad shoulders to run. if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen,"" gingrich said. ""when the 27-and-a-half minute movie comes out, i hope it's accurate. i can say publicly i hope that the super pac runs an accurate movie about bain."" gingrich also took aim at the front-runner for dishing ""pious baloney"" about his political history and reasons for launching a white house bid. ""i realize the red light doesn't mean anything to you because you're the front-runner,"" gingrich said. ""but can we drop a little bit of the pious baloney?"" and romney chided gingrich for his campaign trail rhetoric. ""mr. speaker, i wouldn't say some of the things you've called me in public,"" romney said. ""i think that's just over the top."" cnn's paul steinhauser, shannon travis, shawna shepherd, rachel streitfeld and chris welch contributed to this report.",the candidates seem to relish a chance to follow up on saturday's debate

""easy access and the misperception that spice products are 'natural' and therefore harmless have likely contributed to their popularity,"" the nida website states.

"u.s. fighter jets and drones repeatedly bombed sunni islamic extremists in northern iraq on friday, targeting what officials described as isis artillery units and convoys advancing on the kurdish regional capital of irbil. the airstrikes ramped up america's involvement in iraq where isis, which calls itself the islamic state, is seizing control of towns and key infrastructure in an advance that has forced hundreds of thousands to run for their lives. the critical mosul dam is now in the hands of isis fighters, authorities said, while 150 hundred miles to the east tens of thousands of iraq's minority yazidis were trapped on a mountain by isis fighters below who vowed to kill them. news of the second round of u.s. airstrikes came just after the governor of irbil told cnn that isis may be as close as 30 kilometers (just over 18 miles) from the city of more than a million people. the airstrikes began just hours after president barack obama authorized ""targeted airstrikes,"" saying in a televised address late thursday that the united states had an obligation to protect its personnel in iraq and prevent a potential genocide of minority groups by isis. obama said there will be no buildup of u.s. combat troops in iraq. ""as commander in chief, i will not allow the united states to be dragged into fighting another war in iraq,"" the president said. hitting isis two u.s. f/a 18 fighters first struck an isis artillery unit outside of irbil, dropping two 500-pound laser-guided bombs at about 6:45 a.m. et friday, pentagon spokesman navy rear adm. john kirby said. later, a drone targeted an isis mortar position, kirby said. when isis fighters returned to the site a short time later, the drone struck the target again, he said. that was followed a short time later by a second round of airstrikes, carried out by four u.s. fighter jets, that targeted an isis convoy of seven vehicles and another mortar position, kirby said. the f/a 18s made two passes, dropping a total of eight laser-guided bombs, he said. before the isis onslaught, the region had been the most stable in iraq and a cooperative ally of the united states. u.s. military advisers and consular personnel are stationed in irbil. at this point, the united states has hundreds of military personnel in iraq, including advisers sent in recent weeks to coordinate with iraqi and kurdish military officials in response to the isis rampage. the uss george h.w. bush and other navy ships also are in the region, and the fa/18s in friday's initial strike came from the aircraft carrier, officials said. airstrikes are ""very important"" because isis fighters are well-armed and are outgunning the kurdish forces, thanks to the weapons the militants seized from the iraqi military in mosul, irbil gov. nawzad hadi said. map: where is isis? even as the airstrikes were under way, there was news that isis militants captured iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, just north of mosul, iraq's second-largest city. according to a senior kurdish official, the militant fighters have been using u.s.-made weapons seized during fighting from the iraqi army, including m1 abrams tanks. there had been conflicting reports about who controlled the dam on the tigris river, with heavy fighting under way between isis fighters and kurdish forces, known as peshmerga. u.s. officials have warned that a failure of the dam would be catastrophic, resulting in flooding all the way to baghdad. in other fighting, an iraqi airstrike killed 45 isis fighters and injured 60 friday in the northern town of sinjar, the country's state-run national media center said. sinjar is the town that isis overran last weekend, forcing tens of thousands of yazidis to flee into surrounding mountains without food, water or shelter and prompting concerns of a potential genocide. the yazidis are of kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-islamic sect that draws from christianity, judaism and zoroastrianism. u.s. flights prohibited in other signs of a growing regional conflict: the federal aviation administration issued a notice prohibiting u.s. airlines from flying through iraqi airspace ""due to the hazardous situation created by the armed conflict."" the developments showed that the lightning advance by isis fighters across northern iraq this year has become a battle for the nation's future and overall stability in a part of the world wracked for decades by periodic war. u.s. warplanes patrolling the skies over northern iraq have a ""green light"" to go after perceived isis threats to the kurdish capital, irbil, or to minority populations, said deputy national security adviser ben rhodes. airstrikes are also possible to help kurdish forces end the siege by isis in the northern iraqi mountains, where tens of thousands of yazidis have sought refuge, earnest, the white house spokesman, said friday. isis fighters have surrounded the yazidis on the ground below. ""if there can be american military might that can tip (the) balance, we'll look for an opportunity to do that,"" earnest said. kurdish pleas in announcing his airstrike decision thursday night, obama said the militants would get hit ""should they move towards the city."" kurdish leaders have been pleading for the united states or nato to buttress their forces against isis from the air. the president seems to have heard their appeal. ""we do whatever is necessary to protect our people,"" obama said, adding, ""we support our allies when they're in danger."" before obama announced the airstrikes, two u.s. military cargo planes airdropped 5,300 gallons of water and 8,000 meals onto mount sinjar, where some yazidi children had died from dehydration. according to a u.s. official, a predator drone flying overhead indicates the yazidis have 63 of the 72 pallets dropped with aid supplies. it's not clear if the other pallets missed the drop zone or are in isis hands. late friday, the defense department announced that u.s. military planes made another airdrop of food and water for iraqi citizens stranded on mount sinjar. the british government said friday it would support the u.s. humanitarian effort and planned airdrops of its own. french president françois hollande joined the growing chorus of condemnation of the isis attacks and called on the international community to respond. ""france is ready to take its part,"" hollande said in a statement from his office that called for the european union ""to take an active role very quickly"" and put in place all the necessary assistance to respond to the crisis. meanwhile, the united nations in iraq was ""urgently preparing a humanitarian corridor to allow those in need to flee the areas under threat,"" said nickolay mladenov, the special representative to the u.n. secretary-general. he welcomed the ""cooperation between the government of iraq, the kurdistan regional government (krg) and the international community to help prevent genocide and fight terrorism,"" according to a u.n. statement. iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari told reporters friday from irbil that his government is working with the krg -- including supplying the kurdish peshmerga with ammunition and military helicopters. this hasn't always been the case ""because of political issues,"" the krg's official website notes. yet the same site reported that zebari said ""it is now clear that the peshmerga and the iraqi security forces are fighting together against a common enemy."" beheadings isis has executed people who don't share their fanatical interpretation of sunni islam and posted videos of their killings to the internet. ""convert to islam or die"" is the militants' ultimatum to those captured. they also have beheaded victims and placed their heads on spikes to strike terror in the population, a senior administration official said. already, the obama administration is rapidly funneling weapons to iraqi forces. factories are operating seven days a week to produce them, a senior administration official said. the administration has pushed for iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki's shiite-dominated regime to be replaced by an ethnically more inclusive government but two republican senators said in a statement that the president's actions do not go far enough. and the united states should not wait on iraq to pull together before washington takes action. sens. john mccain of arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina want to see u.s. forces take the fight to isis. ""it should include u.s. airstrikes against isis leaders, forces, and positions both in iraq and syria,"" their statement read. who will stop isis? isis takes iraq's largest christian city",u.s. makes another drop of food and water to iraqis stranded on mountain
"-- two men convicted of killing a british soldier on a london street last year were sentenced wednesday, one to life in prison and the other to a minimum of 45 years. in a brutal attack recorded on closed-circuit tv and by bystanders, michael adebolajo and michael adebowale hit soldier lee rigby with a car then hacked him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in may 2013. the islamic converts, through testimony or their lawyers' arguments in court, indicated they killed rigby for allah. cellphone footage replayed at the trial showed adebolajo, still clutching a cleaver in his bloody hands, ranting that the killing was ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" for british soldiers killing muslims overseas. they were convicted of murder in december. adebolajo will spend life in prison. adebowale received a sentence of at least 45 years. rigby, who had served in afghanistan and was off duty when he was killed at the age of 25, left behind a wife and a young son. the prosecution had asked for the maximum possible sentence: life imprisonment without parole. but defense lawyers argued wednesday for leniency. barrister david gottlieb told the court that the victim was chosen because he was a member of the armed forces and that no one else was hurt in the attack. prosecutor sue hemming said the pair ""reveled in one of the most appalling terrorist murders i have ever seen."" ""not only was the attack brutal and calculated, it was also designed to advance extremist views,"" she said in a prepared statement. ""as a solider, fusilier lee rigby was targeted in a clear act of revenge, deliberately carried out in full view of members of the public for maximum impact."" family members attended court wednesday to hear the sentences handed down. outside the court, demonstrators from the english defence league, a far-right group, carried signs calling for capital punishment to be restored. britain abolished the death penalty in the 1960s. 'i am a soldier of allah' at the trial, the prosecution said that the pair -- both born and raised in britain by families of christian nigerian origin -- deliberately attacked an unarmed man from behind, using a vehicle as a weapon, and that they murdered him and mutilated his body. at trial, adebolajo denied the charges of murder on the grounds that he had acted from religious conviction. he converted to islam in 2002 to 2003, while at a university. adebowale, who did not take the stand, converted to islam more recently, in 2008 to 2009. in court, adebolajo gave a matter-of-fact account of his actions. he declared himself a warrior for allah and said he saw al qaeda as his ""brothers in islam."" he testified the only way he knew that rigby was a soldier was because of his backpack. summing up the case before the jury deliberated, judge nigel sweeney reminded jurors of what happened in the 13 minutes between rigby's body being dragged into the middle of a road near the woolwich barracks and the arrival of police. the judge also cited details of adebolajo's police interview and witness testimony, including that he loved al qaeda and that he had tried to cut off rigby's head because it was the proper method under allah. when asked at the trial what his defense to the charge of murder was, adebolajo said: ""i am a soldier. i am a soldier of allah."" may: 'sickening and barbaric' though adebowale did not give evidence at the trial, his lawyer, abbas lakha, echoed adebolajo's testimony regarding their intent. the judge told the jury that the defense's argument -- that rigby's killing was an act of war or of retaliation -- did not apply. adebolajo and adebowale were found not guilty of attempted murder of a police officer in the case. the prosecution had argued that when they ran toward the police vehicle that responded after rigby's murder -- with adebolajo holding a knife and adebowale a gun -- they intended to kill an officer. however, the defense argued that the two men wanted to be killed by police. the gun was not loaded. at the time of the verdict, home secretary theresa may said the ""sickening and barbaric murder"" of rigby had ""united the entire nation in condemnation.""

"-- the recent release of u.s. army sgt. bowe bergdahl by the taliban in afghanistan has refocused attention on some of the other americans held captive in that region. bergdahl spent five years in the hands of the taliban before the u.s. government reached an agreement for a prisoner swap with his captors stirring debate in the united states about the terms of the deal and circumstances surrounding his capture. although bergdahl was the only american soldier in captivity, other u.s. citizens are being held in the region. the longest detention is that of former fbi agent bob levinson, who went missing after traveling to an iranian island more than seven years ago. his family says he was working for the cia at the time. republican congressman duncan hunter wrote to president barack obama this week to ask why three other americans he said were being held by taliban-linked militants were not part of the deal that freed bergdahl. here are several of the most high-profile cases: bob levinson in march, levinson, 66, passed a grim milestone, becoming the longest held hostage american in history. he vanished after traveling to the iranian island of kish in march 2007. the fbi says he was there as a private investigator. but news reports late last year said he was working as an independent cia contractor when he disappeared. that prompted his family to speak out, saying they kept it quiet for years that levinson was working for the cia, because the u.s. government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy. the fbi, white house and cia have not publicly acknowledged any connection between the cia and levinson. it's unclear who exactly is holding him or what his condition is. the family received a video in 2010 in which levinson said he had been treated well but needed the help of the u.s. government ""to answer the requests of the group that has held me for three-and-a-half years."" american officials have said they believe levinson, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, is being held somewhere in southwest asia. in march, secretary of state john kerry said the u.s. government ""remains committed to the safe return of mr. levinson to his family."" he asked the iranian government to ""work cooperatively with us"" on the investigation, kerry said. but iran has repeatedly said it isn't holding levinson and doesn't know his whereabouts. during an interview in september with cnn's christiane amanpour, iranian president hassan rouhani was asked what he could tell levinson's family. ""we don't know where he is, who he is,"" rouhani said. ""he is an american who has disappeared. we have no news of him."" in january, iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif tolds cnn's jim sciutto that he hadn't seen ""anything that could prove"" that levinson was ever in iran. if he was, zarif said, the united states should explain ""what a cia operative was doing"" there. warren weinstein gunmen abducted weinstein nearly three years ago from his home in lahore, pakistan. they posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the american aid worker and tied up his guards. the 72-year-old is being held by al qaeda, which released a video of weinstein at christmas, showing him looking tired and pale. ""nine years ago, i came to pakistan to help my government and i did so at a time when most americans would not come here,"" he said. ""and now, when i need my government, it seems i have been totally abandoned and forgotten."" his daughter, alisa, says she's worried about his health: he has a heart condition and severe asthma. she told cnn's ""ac360"" on wednesday that the release of bergdahl raised her hopes that her father could be next. for years, when warren weinstein's case came up, u.s. officials called for his release but repeatedly said washington wouldn't bargain with al qaeda. now, alisa weinstein says it's clear that negotiating is an option. but she also said she's worried that the political backlash over bergdahl's case could harm her father's cause. ""we started to realize that the administration is going to be a lot less likely to do this again if it causes some political problems for them,"" she said. ""so does that mean that the door is closed for us?"" weinstein was employed by j.e. austin associates inc., a u.s. consulting firm based in arlington, virginia, that is a usaid contractor. he is a world-renowned development expert, according to the company's website. ""my father is just as deserving of freedom as sgt. bergdahl, as are all of the americans who are being held abroad,"" his daughter said. caitlin coleman in october 2012, coleman and her husband, joshua boyle, disappeared in afghanistan. in his last contact, boyle, a canadian, said they were in an ""unsafe"" part of the war-torn country. coleman's family received two videos last year in which the couple asked to be freed from the taliban captors. the family gave the videos to the associated press. in the videos, coleman is nine-months pregnant and makes a direct plea to ""my president barack obama for help."" ""i would ask that my family and my government do everything they can to bring my husband, child and i to safety and freedom,"" she says. her family had already a posted video of their own on youtube two months after she and boyle disappeared, appealing for their safe return. they said they were concerned about her health and fearful for her unborn child. ""as parents and soon-to-be grandparents, we appeal to whomever is caring for her to show compassion and allow catie, josh, and our unborn grandbaby to come home,"" her father said. boyle's former wife, zaynab, is the sister of omar khadr, a former guantanamo detainee who allegedly received training from al qaeda. their father, ahmed said khadr, was a senior al qaeda leader with connections to osama bin laden. less than two weeks after khadr was released from guantanamo and sent back to canada, boyle and coleman went missing. the videos coleman's family received offer the only clue about what may have happened to the couple, but provide little proof they were indeed kidnapped. no demands for ransom have been made. state department officials say they are aware of the video and of the disappearance of the couple and are in touch with the family. but they say they can't say more because of privacy laws. a spokesman for the canadian foreign ministry says that the government is aware that boyle and coleman have been kidnapped in afghanistan and is in contact with the afghans about the case. the six soldiers at center of bergdahl debate cnn's randi kaye, elise labott and catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report.",u.s. army sgt. bowe bergdahl was released last weekend by the taliban
"facebook has unveiled a new product, facebook home, at an event everyone knew would have something to do with phones and apps and operating systems. ""we're not building a phone and we're not building an operating system,"" ceo mark zuckerberg said thursday. ""but we're also building something that's a whole lot deeper than just another app."" um, ok. thanks for clarifying that, zuck. in all seriousness, though, here's the breakdown on home, a feature facebook hopes will make it part of everything you do on your phone. what is it? as described by zuckerberg and others, home is a ""family of apps"" that essentially push facebook content front and center on your android phone. once the phone ""wakes up,"" the home screen and lock screen are replaced with something called ""cover feed."" images and posts from friends will appear as the new screen's background. users can flip through and interact with them -- ""like"" an update, or post a comment -- immediately without having to open a specific facebook app. one touch takes the user to their apps, or back to the last app they were using. home's other big feature was called ""chat heads,"" which is a basically a tool that combines facebook messenger with the phone's regular sms text-message tool. messages pop up regardless of what the user is doing at the time, along with the sender's profile picture, enclosed in a little circle. the user can decide whether to open the message (without leaving the app or other screen they're on), dismiss it or save it for later with a single touch. when and where can i get it? home will be available in the google play mobile store on april 12 for at least some android phones. users will be able to choose whether to install it permanently, or for a one-off trial session. at release, it will only be optimized for samsung's galaxy s iii and galaxy note ii and the htc one line of phones. it will run on the galaxy s 4 and the htc one when those phones are released, with other phones being added in the coming months. facebook said a version for tablets will be released ""within several months."" how about my iphone? your wait might be quite a bit longer. or, you know, forever. during the event, zuckerberg repeatedly talked about how google's open android system was the perfect place to build home. it's not unusual for mobile-device makers, most notably amazon with its kindle fire tablets, to tweak the system to suit their own needs. apple, on the other hand, has a very closed operating system, giving its developers far less leeway in exchange for what the company says is a smoother, better-developed user experience. creating something like home for apple's ios system would require an almost unprecedented partnership between the companies. ""anything that happens with apple is going to happen with partnership,"" zuckerberg said. ""google's android is open so we don't have to work with them."" still, facebook isn't ruling out the possibility, at least not officially. ""this is a first step and we're continuing to iterate,"" a facebook spokeswoman said in response to iphone questions. ""we chose to start building on android because we could build a more deeply integrated mobile experience. we'll continue to test and iterate on the facebook experience across all platforms. "" what happened to the facebook phone i was hearing about? well, there's not one. while rumors to that effect have swirled for a couple of years, facebook has always maintained it wasn't ""making"" a phone. that remains technically true. but at wednesday's event, htc unveiled the htc first, an at&t exclusive android phone that will be released the same day facebook home goes live. the phone will have home pre-loaded as the default version of its operating system. so it's the closest thing to a facebook phone for now. unveiled by ceo peter chou, the first will be a mid-range phone that looks vaguely like an iphone 5, with a 4.3-inch screen and dual-core snapdragon processor. it will sell for $99 in the united states. folks looking for a high-end htc phone may be more inclined to wait for the htc one, which launches on april 19. what are folks saying? ""jokes aside, i think home is a very smart thing for facebook to do. at least for now. really is a blanket over android. need to play with it."" -- mg siegler, columnist, techcrunch ""wonder when twitter and others will introduce their own ""super apps"" that take over lock screen, home page.... ."" -- stephen levy, senior writer, wired ""it's nice-looking enough, for what it is. but what it is is an assumption that users want to use facebook to filter everything they do with their smartphones ... . putting friends first isn't a bad concept for the smartphone experience. but facebook thinks that friends = facebook and facebook = friends. if this were ever true, it isn't now."" -- jesse brown, columnist, maclean's",facebook home is a family of apps for the android system
"-- authorities in mississippi are being tight-lipped about the death of a mayoral candidate and the arrest of a man found alone in the candidate's damaged suv. on thursday, the coahoma county sheriff's office announced that a suspect, lawrence reed, faces a murder charge in the death of marco mcmillian. reed, 22, was found in mcmillian's wrecked suv on tuesday morning and was taken to a hospital. he is in good condition, the sheriff's office said thursday. on wednesday, authorities found mcmillian's body near a levee between sherard and rena lara, two unincorporated communities about 15 minutes away from clarksdale in northwestern mississippi's delta region. officials have yet to comment on why or how mcmillian was killed. ""it's too early in the investigation to know what the motive is,"" sheriff's office spokesman will rooker said of mcmillian's death. mcmillian's body was taken to the capital, jackson, for an autopsy. patricia mcmillian said that even though media reports since her son's death have labeled him as openly gay, his death likely had nothing to do with his sexual orientation. she told cnn that her son had told only family and friends that he was gay. ""he did not announce in public that he was gay,"" she said, adding, ""i don't think he was attacked because he was gay."" she said that she didn't know reed. ""we never heard of him,"" said amos unger, marco mcmillian's stepfather. mcmillian's facebook page shows a glimpse at a man who was politically ambitious. it includes a picture of mcmillian posing with president barack obama. his campaign motto: ""moving clarksdale forward."" mcmillian's short biography on facebook said he had spent much of his career raising money for universities after he graduated from jackson state with a degree in elementary education. he also received a master's in philanthropy and development from saint mary's university of minnesota. condolences flooded the page, including one from a man who wrote that mcmillian, 34, was one of clarksdale's best leaders. ""the shocking news of marco's death is beyond difficult for us to process,"" his campaign team posted thursday. ""we remember marco as a bold and passionate public servant, whose faith informed every aspect of his life."" bill luckett, who like mcmillian was running for mayor as a democrat, said he thought the politician was ""cordial and articulate."" ""it's a bizarre situation,"" luckett said. ""a sad story."" mcmillian picked up a host of awards in recent years. in 2009, he received the thurgood marshall prestige award from the thurgood marshall college fund. in 2004, ebony magazine recognized him as one of the country's top leaders younger than 30. his fraternity, phi beta sigma, released a lengthy note about mcmillian's accomplishments thursday. mcmillian ""made an incredible difference in his community"" it read, adding that he was the executive director of the fraternity from 2007 to 2011. mcmillian secured the first federal contract to raise awareness about hiv and aids among african-americans for the fraternity and helped it form partnerships with organizations such as the u.s. marine corps and the centers for disease control and prevention in discussing the disease. cnn's rich phillips contributed to this report.",lawrence reed faces murder charge in marco mcmillian's death
"-- with its winding canals and large public parks sitting alongside a busy port and bustling business district, hamburg is a city that contradicts itself. but by combining its industrial strength with a commitment to reduce its impact on the environment, germany's second-largest city is becoming a model for major metropolises around the world. it's already lowered its carbon emissions by 15% since 1990, thanks largely to its efficient public transit system, and it's set a target of reducing its emissions by 40% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. hamburg's eco-friendly credentials aren't immediately obvious to those visiting the city located on the river elbe. ""it's embedded in their culture,"" says anna shepard from green traveller, a website that specializes in helping travelers plan vacations that keep carbon emissions to a minimum. as 2011 european green capital, the city is showcasing a number of its initiatives and programs -- yet one more reason for environmentally-minded travelers to visit. what to see & do to get the best sense of what the city has to offer, head to the waterways. alster lake, located in the city center, is a hub for activities. one of the best ways to truly appreciate it is on a rented canoe or peddle boat. taking a public ferry is a great way to cruise the river elbe, says kim sawford of sandemans new europe tours, a service which connects travelers with local guides in more than a dozen cities in europe, including hamburg. ""they come every 15 minutes and take you alongside the harbor, the artificial beaches, stopping off at some little fishing villages just outside the city. it's the best way to see the waterway."" hamburg boasts an abundant amount of green space. more than 16% of the urban area consists of forest, recreation and green spaces. stroll around stadtpark, one of the city's largest parks which hosts open-air concerts during the summer. the city is littered with beautiful old buildings such as the town hall, however for a glimpse at hamburg's future, head to the waterside district of hafencity. still under development, the ambitious urban project is being designed as a model for counteracting sprawl and promoting sustainable living. getting around it's easy to explore the city center on foot, and hamburg's public transport system is renowned for being easy to use and accessible, even for the foreign traveler. but if you want to have more freedom when exploring the city, hop on a bike from the city's stradtrad network.

"(cnn)three defendants have been sentenced to prison for their roles in the hate crime death of a black man in mississippi who died after being beaten by a group of white teens and run over by a truck in 2011, u.s. authorities said. deryl paul dedmon, now 22, was sentenced to 50 years in prison; john aaron rice, 21, to more than 18 years; and dylan wade butler, 23, to seven years, federal authorities said this week. each defendant had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of violating the matthew shepard and james byrd jr. hate crimes prevention act in the death of james craig anderson, 48, authorities said. ""the defendants targeted african-american people they perceived as vulnerable for heinous and violent assaults -- hate crimes, motivated solely by race, that shook an entire community and claimed the life of an innocent man,"" attorney general eric holder said in a statement. seven other defendants are awaiting sentencing, authorities said. the three defendants admitted they and others conspired to harass african-americans with beer bottles, sling shots and vehicles in attempt to injure them, authorities said. the defendants targeted blacks who were homeless or drunk ""because they believe that such individuals were less likely to report an assault,"" authorities said in a statement. ""the co-conspirators would often boast about these racially motivated assaults."" after a birthday party for a mutual friend, the defendants and other conspirators agreed to assault blacks, authorities said. rice, butler and other occupants in a jeep found anderson in a motel parking lot about 5 a.m. on june 25, 2011, in jackson and ""decided that anderson would be a good target for an assault because he was african-american and appeared to be intoxicated,"" authorities said in a statement. rice and a conspirator distracted anderson while they waited for dedmon to arrive. dedmon and two conspirators arrived in dedmon's ford f250 truck. rice first punched anderson in the face to knock him to the ground, and then dedmon punched anderson in the face several times while he was on the ground, authorities said. as the defendants and conspirators left the lot, one shouted, ""white power!"" just before getting back into his truck, dedmon also yelled, ""white power!"" dedmon then ""deliberately"" ran over anderson, causing injuries that killed him, authorities said. rice, butler and a number of the conspirators then gave false statements to police about the incident, authorities said. anderson's death drew national attention after cnn first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing, captured by a parking lot security camera in a jackson suburb. watch: incident caught on video the killing prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in jackson, a city of about 175,000. authorities believe dedmon led and instigated the attack, which took place after a night of drinking in largely white rankin county, outside jackson. the gang of teens climbed into dedmon's green truck and a white suv and drove 16 miles to the western edge of jackson. they would have seen anderson immediately as they exited the highway, officials said. he was standing in the hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp. on the videotape obtained exclusively by cnn, the group of teens is seen pulling into the parking lot and stopping where anderson is standing, although he is just off camera and not visible. the teens can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and anderson. witnesses told authorities this is when anderson's beating took place, as the teens yelled racial epithets, including ""white power."" authorities allege dedmon and many of the other teens pummeled anderson repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground, although this is not visible on the tape. after the beating, some of the teens left and others got into the green ford truck. at this moment, anderson becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walks toward the truck. shortly afterward, dedmon allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing, according to statements some of the teens made to detectives.

"-- as my companion and i passed through security on a gorgeous washington afternoon friday, invited by president barack obama to join hundreds of openly lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender folks at the white house for a reception celebrating lgbt pride month, i couldn't help but reflect back. the white house and i go back a long way. in the 1950s, as a young gay boy growing up in a small fishing town on the southern coast of california, i had, for some seemingly inexplicable reason, an intense fascination with all things white house, and especially its occupants, our american presidents. on halloween in the third grade, my mom crafted for me a magnificent costume of thomas jefferson, and i missed that i'd won a prize because my cotton wig impaired my hearing. at major family gatherings, i'd dress up in what became known as my ""presidentials"" and entertained relatives by my deft ability to name all the presidents in order, right up to and including dwight eisenhower. so, the idea of growing up to be president some day was implanted in my head, and it became the source of great consternation for me when, in grad school in the late '60s as civil rights, feminist and anti-vietnam war ferment was swelling, i ratified my own commitment to social justice by openly claiming my gay identity. i burst out of the closet with a bang, co-founding the berkeley, california, chapter of the gay liberation front, for one thing. but with all that came the sad realization that, alas, i had to completely abandon my dream of ever becoming president. still, the white house beckoned me. in the mid-1980s, i had an opportunity to represent an obscure and unhappy publication as its journalistic correspondent in the white house for a few years. i leaped at the chance, moving across the u.s. to be there, in the press room, almost daily. i didn't like who i worked for and i didn't like who was president at the time, but i loved the white house, especially on the few occasions when i was included among journalists invited to one of the many holiday parties held there. lz granderson: the secret gay agenda ah, the east room (where the formal news conferences were also held), the blue room, the red room and so forth! all the ponderous presidential portraits and artifacts chronicling the colorful history of the nation's chief executives. but while there, i felt light years away. i was gay, and i kept it to myself in those days. i was an outsider granted a glimpse of what i'd cherished so intimately as a youth. the idea of being gay was allowed nowhere near the official corridors of power. to the gay movement, it was a huge breakthrough when, in the 1990s, a president first uttered the word, ""gay,"" in a nonderogatory or ""as in happy"" sense, in a major speech. president bill clinton later spoke at one of the first national dinners of the human rights campaign in the late 1990s. held at a hotel ballroom blocks from the white house, i was there. hope for lgbt people was in the air. fast forwarding to last week, it was deeply moving to be back in the white house, finally not as a closeted journalist or anything other than an open and affirming public citizen. unlike the lgbt reception held there just a year earlier, this time there were women and men in military uniform, some holding hands with their same-sex partners, made possible only after the president led the overturning of don't ask, don't tell in the course of the past year. entering the east room amid cheers to speak to us, president barack obama reaffirmed the commitment he'd made only weeks before to full support for gay marriage. we have a president now who can say without hesitation, as he did friday, ""as long as i have the privilege of being your president, i promise you, you won't just have a friend in the white house, you will have a fellow advocate for an america where no matter what you look like or where you come from or who you love, you can dream big dreams and dream as openly as you want."" thank you, mr. president: you mean those kind of ""big dreams"" i had as a kid! there is no doubt in my mind now that there is some lgbt youngster in our land right now who will grow up to become president of the united states some day. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of nicholas benton.","as a child, nicholas benton was fascinated with white house and presidents"

"(cnn)the long investigation surrounding a mysterious battery fire that made so much trouble for boeing's 787 dreamliner is closed. the national transportation safety board report -- released december 1 -- comes nearly two years after burning and smoking batteries grounded all 50 of the world's most advanced airliners flying at the time. when you pick apart the 110-page document, it reveals how any new piece of equipment can pose dangerous problems, even a noncritical piece of equipment like batteries. in this situation, the battery created one of the worst threats possible: an onboard fire. from a broader perspective, the investigation reminds us of the heavy responsibilities shared by the world's aviation regulators and aircraft makers. the battery problems struck boeing shortly after it had rolled out what was then a new model aircraft, with some of the most sophisticated technology available. it all started in january 2013, when an empty japan airlines 787 caught fire while parked at boston's logan airport. a second battery incident nine days later in japan prompted the federal aviation administration to ground the entire dreamliner fleet while the problem was fixed. read more about the battery now, with more than 200 dreamliners in service, the faa says safer battery systems have been installed in the planes. the ntsb basically blamed the battery problem on two things: --overheating from an electrical short circuit that may have been caused by manufacturing defects --allegedly unsatisfactory oversight of the manufacturing process by both the federal aviation administration and boeing read the full ntsb report (pdf) on the battery fire to bring the investigation into sharper focus, here are eight questions and answers associated with the report: 1. what was the root cause of the short circuit? it's remarkable: the investigation was unable to pinpoint the root cause of the battery cell short-circuit. neither could japanese investigators, although they had a theory. 2. how closely does the faa monitor the development of aviation technology? the faa allows boeing and other qualified manufacturers to use their own employees to confirm that new aircraft components meet safety regulations. they follow specific faa guidelines and submit to regular checks by faa officials. experts say more and more of that self-checking oversight is moving further down the supply chain to subcontractors. ntsb investigators recommended that both the faa and boeing ""develop or revise processes to establish more effective oversight"" of suppliers. the report also called on the dreamliner's japan-based battery maker, gs yuasa corp., to ""review its cell manufacturing processes and ensure its employees are properly trained."" kenneth quinn, a washington-based attorney who represents the battery maker, said this week that ""gs yuasa had respectfully disagreed with a number of the observations ntsb made regarding manufacturing defects."" he said the company is studying the report and is ""eager to implement continuous quality improvements with the suggestions of the ntsb, faa"" and japan's aviation regulators. 3. how did all this get started? the battery, like those aboard all dreamliners, was a lithium-ion battery, a technology that airline manufacturers like as a way to save fuel costs because of its low weight. lithium-ion batteries also power cell phones and laptops. it's a developing technology that has a history of overheating issues. related: watch video of the 787 that caught fire in 2013 related: 787 dreamliner infographic the faa had already certified these batteries as safe and flight worthy. apparently they weren't. passenger safety and billions of dollars in boeing aircraft orders were at risk. officials needed to know what went wrong. that's why the faa did something next that it hadn't done in more than 30 years: it grounded an entire type of airliner, nationwide. for about four months dreamliners sat idle. to fix the problem, each battery was put inside a fireproof steel box to prevent the battery from catching fire. just in case, the box includes vents that would force any smoke outside the plane. more insulation against heat was also added, and the batteries were redesigned to charge at lower levels. in the 19 months since the dreamliner fix, there have been no reports of batteries catching fire, although a 787 battery cell did overheat while on the ground earlier this year. ""the improvements made to the 787 battery system last year appear to have worked as designed,"" boeing told flightglobal in a statement at the time. related: beacon blamed for london dreamliner fire 4. could it happen again? boeing and the battery maker say no. theoretically, if another dreamliner battery short-circuits and overheats, the system will remain safe because there won't be enough oxygen in the containment box for a fire to be possible, a boeing spokeswoman said. does that make the battery maker comfortable with the fact that the root cause of the short-circuit remains a mystery? ""gs yuasa is very comfortable in knowing that the quality of the manufacturing processes and the redesign of the battery will prevent a situation from occurring as it did in the boston and japanese incidents,"" said quinn. 5. how important are these batteries, anyway? they're necessary, but they have backups in case they fail. the batteries are used only before take-off to power up the cockpit computer and to start the plane's auxiliary power unit. (that's the thing that fires up the 787's two jet engines.) after takeoff -- unless there's a power failure -- these batteries are not in use because electricity to run onboard equipment is generated by the engines. even if there is a power failure -- which is highly unlikely -- there are other ways pilots can create electrical power to run the 787's steering and other systems. for example, small wind turbines -- called ram air turbines, or rats -- that pop out of the aircraft to generate juice via wind power. 6. will boeing and the faa develop a more effective process to oversee suppliers? boeing says it did that already, before the ntsb report. the company said it now has a ""more formal flow of requirements and increased interaction between boeing, its suppliers and sub-tier suppliers as compared to the processes in place earlier."" the faa said it also has ""effective processes in place to identify and correct issues that emerged before and after certification"" of the 787. but it also said it's still evaluating the ntsb recommendations ""and will provide a timely response to the board."" 7. do airliner manufactures plan to use lithium-ion batteries on new aircraft models? they do. immediately after the dreamliner's troubles, boeing competitor airbus announced it was pulling lithium-ion batteries from early production models of its new a350 aircraft and going with traditional -- and heavier -- nickel cadmium batteries. but in september airbus did a 180. it said it planned to switch back to lithium-ion batteries on a350s set to be delivered in 2016. airbus' chief designer told bloomberg the company can ""mitigate any risks to zero."" boeing said this week it would decide whether to use lithium-ion batteries in new planes ""on a case-by-case basis."" 8. were there any surprises in the report? yes: a random, unrelated problem with a new type of cockpit voice recorder. the report revealed that a new recorder on the japan airlines dreamliner didn't record voices very well, a situation that ""could impede future aircraft investigations,"" the ntsb said. almost all crew conversations recorded by the cockpit voice recorder were ""completely obscured"" by ambient cockpit noise, according to the report. the faa should require boeing to improve the quality of the audio on the recording device, the ntsb said. boeing said it's still examining the ntsb recommendations. overall, for aviation enthusiasts and fans of the dreamliner, the report offered a mountain of insider data about the popular aircraft. as quinn, the gs yuasa attorney, put it, ""i think we can all rest assured that this is the most investigated battery incident, ever.""",investigation ends into 2013 lithium-ion battery fire on boeing 787 dreamliner
"-- fitness isn't usually a requirement for theme parks -- standing in lines, climbing into rides and screaming in abject terror require only basic levels of stamina. not so at the world's first-ever sports amusement park planned for the olympic stadium and other olympic venues in barcelona, which promises to give visitors the chance to experience what it's like to race against usain bolt. open camp will offer more than 50 ""virtual experiences with links to every sport"" when it opens in 2015, according to officials in the spanish city. details of how they'll be able to strut their stuff against the world's fastest and strongest are so far thin on the ground, but a promotional video offers some clues. one image shows people strapped to horizontal machines that supposedly mimic swimming as a screen in front of them shows an olympic-sized pool. another shows a visitor in ski gear hoisted aloft in a wind tunnel apparently designed to recreate the experience of ski jumping. it's not just about taking part though -- it's also about winning. the park will also stage daily awards ceremonies to dole out bronze, silver and gold. 'sportainment' experience a statement said ""the best technology on the planet"" would be used in creating the ""sportainment"" experience. ""visitors will be able to feel what it is like to be professional football players, run a smooth 100 meters against usain bolt, take part in any olympic games race recreated exactly as it was in reality and experience a medals ceremony,"" it said. it said the park is intended to breathe new life into the ""neglected"" venues that hosted barcelona's olympics in 1992. since then the venues have continued to host sports events as well as music concerts. ""the park will bring more life to the stadium than it has today and encourage more of the public to use it, while allowing it to continue holding big events,"" says maite fandos, one of the city's deputy mayors. more than â‚¬20 million ($26 million) of private funding has been stumped up for the project, which is expected to create at least 240 jobs and bring in up to â‚¬53 million in annual revenues. tickets ranging from â‚¬20-30 are likely to be priced according to the sports that visitors want to take part in, the statement says. while it sounds exhausting, open camp promoter francesc medina reportedly insists it'll be an experience for everyone, ""even people with a beer gut."" would you visit a sports theme park? let us know in the comments.",sports theme park planned for barcelona's olympic venues
"-- democrats know the history: 2014 is all but certain to be a tough year. but there is a sense among some top democratic strategists that the political climate is shifting in ways that could keep the midterm climate from turning from bad to disastrous. perhaps it is wishful thinking, and it is important -- very important -- to note how things look in april is often not how they turn out come november. but democrats just in the past week have received a few nuggets of potentially helpful news: * friday's labor department report showing the economy added 192,000 jobs in march. * enrollment in the president's health care plan crossed the 7 million mark at the first big deadline to sign up. * a slight but potentially important uptick in president barack obama's approval rating. gallup's daily tracking poll had this key midterm barometer at 45 percent on friday, a near 2014 high and up from 39 percent in early february. (president george w. bush had a 38 percent approval rating in november 2006 -- his second term midterm election -- and democrats gained 30 house seats). plus, democratic-leaning superpacs are beginning to spend more money, and in a few notable cases testing a new strategy of punching directly back at the source of millions of dollars in conservative spending that helped turn the early 2014 climate decidedly in favor of the gop. not that democrats should be popping -- or even ordering -- champagne. to be clear, top party strategists still expect to lose seats in both the house and the senate. the goal, though, is to keep the house losses to single digits and to deny republicans the net gain of six seats the gop needs to take control of the senate. the principal driver of midterm election seasons is the president's approval rating; the closer the incumbent gets to 50 percent, the better democrats feel about avoiding a november bloodbath. and any president benefits when people feel better about the economy, which is where the new jobs report, and the immediate debate about its meaning, comes in. the 192,000 new jobs was a bit below the consensus estimates, so republicans were quick to label it not good enough. ""our economy still isn't creating jobs for the american people at the rate they were promised,"" house speaker john boehner said in a statement. too early to run obamacare victory lap democrats, however, focused on the trend line. the economy added 533,000 jobs in the first three months of 2014. by contrast, job growth in all of 2010 -- a disastrous midterm election year for democrats -- was barely above 1 million. back then, it was a punishing summer slump that shaped the fall election mood -- so given recent history, it would be a mistake for democrats to invest too much hope in this year's first quarter. but the early betting is that the job market in this midterm year will be stronger, and less volatile, than in 2010. turning the health care political tide is tougher, but one democratic pollster stan greenberg argues must become a strategic imperative. as noted recently in an analysis produced by the gop polling firm public opinion strategies, opponents of the health care law are more likely to cite it as a major factor in their 2014 voting decisions. that ""intensity gap"" is the major source of gop midterm optimism. greenberg, in a memo released thursday, argues that democrats need to reshape the health care terrain. ""when the debate is between implementing or repealing the (affordable care act), the intensity shifts towards implementing the law,"" the veteran democratic pollster says. ""so it is possible that democrats will be able to turn the debate."" inside politics: gop responds to obamacare enrollment with new repeal plan also worth watching is a growing democratic effort to create a 2014 political bogeyman out of the koch brothers. it wasn't all that long ago that veteran democratic rep. nick rahall was contemplating retirement. now, though, the west virginia congressman is in the middle of an experiment democrats hope helps them minimize their midterm losses. evan jenkins is rahall's republican opponent. but turn on a tv in the 3rd congressional district and you can't miss a rugged coal miner warning ""new york billionaires"" are trying to defeat rahall. translation: the koch brothers, the conservative megadonors whose spending spree has democratic candidates across the country on their heels. now, democratic leaning groups are fighting back by making the koch's an issue -- labeling them a rich special interest group trying to get the best congress money can buy. in addition to west virginia, the house majority pac is running ads attacking the koch brothers in arizona's 2nd congressional district, where democratic rep. ron barber faces a tough reelection climate. already the koch brothers were an issue in several senate campaigns, again as democratic-leaning groups try to improve an election climate in which the early spending by the koch's, primarily through an organization called americans for prosperity, has improved gop prospects. the pro-democratic senate majority pac is attacking the koch brothers in five states with key senate races: arkansas, colorado, louisiana, north carolina and michigan. americans for prosperity has spent millions in those states and elsewhere attacking democrats for supporting obama's health care law. the version running in colorado urges voters to consider, ""those behind the attacks -- insurance companies and out of state billionaires."" koch brothers target another democratic senator it's a somewhat risky strategy -- using precious advertising resources to attack someone not on the ballot. but more and more democrats think it is worth the effort. rep. steve israel, chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee, said the koch's heavy spending and the frequent national media attention it receives makes them a legitimate target. ""the koch brothers are becoming their own brand,"" israel said in a conversation this week. democratic strategist paul begala concurs -- and drew a parallel to his 2012 work for a pro-obama superpac. ""nobody had heard of bain capital either, until we told them about it,"" begala said. ""of course the democrats are wise to tell voters about the controversial billionaires. ... what did mama say to you when someone said something hateful? 'consider the source,'"" he said. but veteran gop ad guru alex castellanos isn't so sure. years ago, castellanos says one of his favorite ad targets was george meany, then the afl-cio leader. ""beat the hell out of him,"" castellanos said. ""problem is, he wasn't on the ballot. democrats won."" to castellanos, the direct aim at the koch brothers proves ""the democrat party today is exhausted. it's a tactical party, trying to eke out victories on demographics and negative assaults."" democrats, not surprisingly, disagree. they argue the koch ""bogeyman"" strategy is helping their candidates and with fund-raising. more broadly, the democratic bottom line can be summed up this way: the year is still likely to be rough, but that the terrain in early april looks a bit less treacherous than it did in early march.",democrats are banking on a boost from good obamacare and jobs report figures
"on sunday, the pentagon announced it transferred six guantanamo bay detainees to uruguay for resettlement as refugees, a move which house intelligence committee chairman mike rogers says should be reconsidered. ""i've been opposed to this notion that we're going to farm out gitmo to places,"" rogers told candy crowley on cnn's ""state of the union,"" noting most of the detainees sent to uruguay are not originally from there. according to rogers, the foreign intelligence services the united states pays to monitor the newly released detainees in countries such as uruguay are often ill-equipped to handle the job. ""what we have found in the past is it doesn't work very well,"" he said. ""i don't think that surprises anybody. so i argue that maybe we ought to rethink what we're doing here."" echoing the sentiments of many members of congress, rogers said some previously released prisoners are now re-engaged in the terrorist fight. ""we knew that was going to happen,"" rogers said. ""that's why those of us who were trying to do the review of this were so concerned, because they were so interested in getting them out, that they forgot to do the due diligence -- i think -- that would allow them to at least protect those that were going to go back into the fight, from getting back into the fight."" last week, the obama administration suffered a huge setback in its attempt to close down the detention camp permanently when the house passed a $585 billion defense authorization bill excluding language that would have banned the transfer of any more prisoners to guantanamo bay, a stipulation the white house had sought. on monday, senate armed services committee chairman carl levin, d-michigan, said it would also likely be absent from the final bill sent to the president's desk. ""our language (on guantanamo) ... will not be in,"" levin told reporters last week. the president has sought to close guantanamo bay since he took office in 2008 -- and issued an executive order to do so in 2009 -- but has faced fierce opposition from members of congress, like rogers, who allege that doing so is a threat to national security. outgoing defense secretary chuck hagel, who recently announced his resignation in light of administrative pressure, authorized the prisoner release, according to the pentagon. his reluctance to approve the mission until now could have been a part of the tension leading to his resignation. but house intelligence committee member adam schiff, d-california, defended hagel's decision to delay the authorization of the mission, citing his continued concerns over the timing of the prisoner release. ""there were a couple of things i think secretary hagel had some continued concerns over,"" schiff said on cnn's ""newsroom."" ""he wanted to make sure that he was satisfied that he could sign on the dotted line."" schiff pointed to uruguay's recent presidential election as one of the roadblocks. ""there was an election taking place in uruguay, and i think the president -- who agreed to accept these detainees -- didn't want it to be an issue in the presidential campaign,"" schiff said. ""and so it was stayed until after that election was over.""","the pentagon transferred six guantanamo bay detainees to uruguay, it announced sunday"
"-- colorado authorities are working to determine whether a high-speed chase thursday involving a man who shot repeatedly at law enforcement officers in texas is related to this week's shooting death of tom clements, colorado's prison chief. the chase and crash occurred in north texas, about 700 miles from where clements was killed tuesday night. it began around 11 a.m. ct (noon et) in montague county, where the driver of a black cadillac shot at a law enforcement officer who had pulled him over in a traffic stop, said wise county, texas, sheriff david walker. two bullets struck the montague county deputy, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, in the chest and another grazed his head before he managed to call in help, said the sheriff. he is in serious condition at a dallas-fort worth area hospital. this incident was followed by a high-speed chase that ended around 30 miles away in decatur, texas. that's where city police tried to pull him over, and the cadillac's driver fled and started shooting at officers. the suspect shot one patrol vehicle and that of decatur police chief rex hoskins, whose car was parked in the median. ""i would say he was running about 100 mph, and he had his left arm out the window and he was just shooting,"" hoskins said. soon after that, the man turned his cadillac onto another road and slammed into an 18-wheel truck, according to walker. even with the front of his car crushed, the suspect -- who has not been publicly identified -- got out and resumed shooting. he did not shoot any responding officers in the wise county exchange, but was shot himself. after being kept alive on machines for some time, the suspect died thursday evening, according to walker. colorado media and national wire services identified the man killed in the texas chase and shooting as evan ebel, a 28-year-old parolee in the denver metropolitan area. on thursday night, the el paso county sheriff's office issued a statement mentioning evan spencer ebel had been named in a denver post report citing unnamed federal and state authorities, then sharply criticized such an anonymous disclosure as ""disappointing"" and saying it ""undermines an active investigation and can have a negative impact on any future prosecution."" cnn has not been able to independently confirm the identity of the man killed in texas. the cadillac had two different colorado license plates -- one on the front and the other on the back -- said hoskins. a law enforcement official said thursday that authorities are ""are taking a strong look"" at whether thursday's incident and clements' shooting are linked. ""colorado is sending ... investigators that are working on that case and other homicide cases in the colorado area,"" walker said. denver police, noting that they've been working closely with colleagues in nearby golden, tweeted thursday evening there is ""a strong connection with the texas case"" and another colorado homicide and that its investigators are heading to texas. golden police report the two police departments are together investigating the march 17 shooting death of a 27-year-old pizza delivery man. nathan collin leon disappeared from work in denver and was found dead in golden. saudi national's case considered in probe the texas incident comes the same day that colorado investigators said they were looking closely at one criminal of the thousands that clements' oversaw in the state's prison system -- a saudi national named homaidan al-turki. el paso county, colorado, undersheriff paula presley on thursday acknowledged the media speculation over al-turki, who was convicted of sexually assaulting his housemaid at his aurora, colorado, home seven years ago. earlier this month, clements denied al-turki's request to serve the remainder of his colorado prison sentence in saudi arabia, records show. investigators, she said, are still trying to determine whether ""there may have been some motivation or legitimate threat"" related to al-turki's case, adding that ""we have not identified that specifically as a threat."" al-turki, now at the limon correctional facility, was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison after being convicted on a dozen counts of sexual contact, theft, extortion and false imprisonment in 2006, a state document shows. prosecutors said he enslaved his indonesian maid for several years. at the request of the u.s. ambassador to saudi arabia, colorado attorney general john suthers traveled to riyadh in 2006 to meet with king abdullah, other saudi officials and the al-turki family to discuss the case. clements explained in a march 11 letter to al-turki that he was turning down his transfer request because al-turki had refused to go through sex offender treatment, as required by law. ""to date you have reportedly declined due to religious reasons/conflicts with your islamic faith,"" clements wrote. the letter also notes that on february 25, 2011, al-turki's sentence was reduced to six years to life. read the full letter cnn has not received a response to its requests for comment from al-turki's lawyers. in light of the renewed attention on his case, al-turki was removed this week from the rest of his prison's population, according to the state's department of corrections. late prisons chief described as 'amazing man' clements had been chief of colorado's prison system for a little over two years. he took the job in january 2011 after working for 31 years as part of missouri's department of corrections. in his time in colorado, he'd made a big impression.

"-- turns out, vince lombardi was wrong. winning isn't the only thing. in some nfl cities this season, losing matters even more. from miami to indianapolis, from minnesota to st. louis, some fans want their team to lose as many games as possible to get the no. 1 pick in the next nfl draft, which would give them an opportunity to draft the player who is widely regarded as the most polished prospect at quarterback in years to enter the league. or, to use the rallying cry that's becoming popular, they want their team to ""suck for luck."" his name is andrew luck, and he's a redshirt junior at stanford. he would have been the no. 1 pick had he declared for the draft after his junior season, when he completed 70.7% of his passes for 3,338 yards, 32 touchdowns and just eight interceptions. he is on pace to match or even top those numbers this season for the cardinal, which is 6-0 and hosts washington on saturday. but his value is more than just numbers. he has all the tools that make a great quarterback, a 6-foot-4 frame with a cannon for an arm, plus a feel for the game beyond his 22 years. one player cannot transform a football team. but every team covets a franchise player at the most important position on the field, and luck, who has another year of eligibility that no one expects him to use, is probably the best to come out of college since peyton manning in 1998. even the great manning, however, wasn't a lock for the no. 1 pick like luck is in 2012. hard as it is to believe, some analysts thought ryan leaf, an eventual bust in the nfl, was a better choice. nobody is a close second this year. luck, barring a catastrophe, will go to the team with the worst record in the league. ""he is the real deal,"" john madden, the longtime nfl analyst and hall of fame coach, said on sirius satellite radio this week. ""i've been watching the nfl for years, and i don't remember a more automatic, sure thing."" which leads to the ""suck for luck"" movement. the precise origins of that phrase are unknown. it has become a twitter handle -- @suckforluck -- which is ""imploring the miami dolphins or the terrible nfl team of your choice to tank for the #1 overall pick."" the dolphins are the clear favorites in the suck for luck sweepstakes, but hardly the only contender. here are the teams with the best shot at sucking enough to get the no. 1 pick, with their odds: miami: not only do the dolphins (0-5) have a lame duck coach, tony sparano, and an overmatched quarterback, matt moore, they also have an owner who seems resigned to the quest. according to the miami herald, owner stephen ross has told his friends he's willing to put up with short-term losses if the end result is the franchise quarterback his team needs. odds: 2-1. indianapolis: colts vice chairman bill polian recently scouted luck, and with good reason. the colts (0-6) are owners of the worst record in football and seem completely hapless without manning. but manning is expected to return from neck surgery and just agreed to a $90 million contract with the team. could the colts really draft luck and start him as a backup? you bet. odds: 4-1. minnesota: the vikings (1-5) rolled the dice in the offseason, acquiring veteran quarterback donovan mcnabb, but he has struggled mightily and will be replaced this week by untested christian ponder. viking fans have been waiting years for a great quarterback in his prime, and have to be salivating at the prospects of having luck and all-pro running back adrian peterson in the same huddle. still, with peterson, minnesota is going to win games this year. odds: 8-1. st. louis: the rams (0-5) certainly have the suck part covered, but they believe, in young quarterback sam bradford, that they already have their franchise quarterback. would they bail on him to grab luck? hey, they could always trade him. but playing in the woeful nfc west will lead to a few victories for bradford and co. odds: 10-1. the field: carolina (1-5) is off to a slow start but just used the no. 1 pick in the 2011 draft on former auburn quarterback cam newton, who has dazzled at times in his rookie season. arizona (1-4) has lost four straight games, but made the trade for quarterback kevin kolb. denver (1-4) made the switch to florida quarterback tim tebow, a folk hero for his conservative views, so it seems unlikely the broncos would suck enough. odds: 15-1. one other wrinkle: luck's father, oliver, is a former nfl quarterback himself. would the luck family try to pull a draft-day power play like some other franchise quarterbacks, including eli manning and john elway, and refuse to sign with a team it deems unacceptable? until april, it's all speculation ... and, for the contenders, losing. ""we don't really pay much attention to it, to be honest with you,"" denver coach john fox said this week when asked about the luck sweepstakes. ""but it's part of the popularity of our great game of nfl football. being a competitor, i don't know many coaches or players to be different. you're trying to win every game."" luck, not surprisingly, thinks this entire ""suck for luck"" thing is ridiculous. he returned to stanford this season because he loves the college experience, not to create a year of fans hoping for their teams to lose. his former college coach jim harbaugh, now the 49ers coach, has called luck ""as good a competitor as you'll ever see."" he is 26-5 as a starter. ""i am aware of it,"" luck told the new york times. ""a couple of guys told me about it. i think it's stupid. simply put."" it may be stupid, but it'll be one of the most-watched storylines of the 2011 season. while the teams at the top chase a super bowl title, ultimately the biggest winner could end up being this year's biggest loser.",stanford senior and football quarterback andrew luck called no. 1 pick in the next nfl draft
"editor's note: ann m. veneman is the executive director of unicef and former u.s. agriculture secretary. last week, unicef released its annual report on the state of the world's children 2009. to learn more about the report, visit www.unicef.org. ann veneman says the lack of basic necessities makes pregnancy and childbirth fatal to millions. -- every day in the united states, thousands of women and families experience one of the most joyous occasions in their lifetime -- the birth of a child. that joy is certainly not as often the case in many parts of the world. women in the least-developed countries are 300 times more likely to die in childbirth or from complications related to pregnancy than women in developed countries. half a million women die due to pregnancy or childbirth complications every year. the lack of the most basic necessities such as a doctor, nurse, clean water, supplies or even a medical facility is robbing precious innocence and devastating families. such services are often sorely lacking in the poorest regions of the world, particularly in africa and asia, which account for the vast majority of all worldwide maternal and newborn deaths. conflict, hiv and aids, migration and a lack of investment in public health services have made this devastating situation even worse. in my travels to these regions, i have seen firsthand the impact of these challenges. it's heartbreaking to hear how women have to walk miles while in labor to reach the nearest hospital, only to arrive finding that there are no doctors available or that the conditions are unsanitary. in many cases, both the mother and newborn lose their lives. unfortunately, stories like these are not uncommon. i recently visited sierra leone, the country with the highest rate of under-5 mortality in the world. one reason for this is that the vast majority of women do not breast-feed their children. the women i talk with say it is custom to feed their children rice water. this provides little nutritional value and leaves children susceptible to disease and death. however, it is illustrative of the challenges we face in reducing child mortality rates. educating women, particularly young girls, about critical health issues is a priority for unicef. the younger a girl is when she becomes pregnant, the greater the health risks for her and her baby. other factors such as sexual violence and other gender-related abuses pose tremendous challenges and increase the risk that adolescent girls will drop out of school. this, in turn, entrenches the vicious cycle of gender discrimination, poverty and high rates of maternal and neonatal death. a child born in sierra leone has more than an one in four chance of not living to see his or her first birthday. that country also has the worst record for prenatal care. regular immunizations, vitamins, rehydration for children suffering from diarrhea and the use of bed nets to protect from malarial mosquitoes are simple and effective ways of keeping women and children alive. though the challenges to reach the most vulnerable are high, we are seeing important progress made through international support. however, more can and must be done. through proven interventions at key stages in life and pregnancy, millions of women and children can be saved each year. we know that the vast majority of maternal deaths are preventable when women have access to essential maternity and basic health-care services. the most vital need is for more skilled professionals and medical facilities throughout pregnancy, birth and postnatal care. unicef continues to work with other international agencies to bring more resources to accelerate progress. these efforts are designed to reduce these deaths, and we are seeing some remarkable improvements. in 2007, while i was in ethiopia helping open a clean water processing facility, a woman stood up and told me her story. every day, she would spend up to 10 hours in search of clean water to ensure her children could drink and eat. with clean water now in her community, she can focus on keeping her children healthy and ensuring they are receiving a good education. she knows, like so many women around the world in her situation, that the key to ending this suffering is through greater education, awareness and resources to help improve the lives and care of women and children. by doing so, we can significantly reduce and eventually end this horrific loss of life. the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of ann veneman.","ann veneman: in america, childbirth ends in joy for a very high number of families"
"-- zahra baker had been an international symbol of strength and hope: a freckle-faced girl who lost part of her left leg at age 5 and her hearing while being treated for cancer, she kept smiling and fighting through it all. yet zahra's life ended violently in fall 2010. that's when her stepmother, elisa baker, told police in hickory, north carolina, that the girl, then 10, was killed and dismembered, according to search warrants. the youngster's body parts were then disposed of in various locations, the stepmother told police. while police found some of zahra's remains in the weeks after she was reported missing, some parts hadn't been accounted for. but authorities took a major step forward on this count thursday, with the confirmation that a skull found in april 2012 in caldwell county, north carolina, belonged to the girl. 2010: north carolina community remembers zahra baker ""the life and death of zahra baker profoundly impacted those who came to know this brave young lady through her tragic story,"" said district attorney james gaither jr., whose district includes the section of central north carolina where the crime occurred and whose office confirmed the finding about zahra's skull. ""zahra and her life will be forever in our thoughts, and 'team zahra' will forever be connected through her spirit."" members of the north carolina state bureau of investigation, the north carolina medical examiner's office and the marshall university forensic science center in huntington, west virginia, analyzed the skull and told gaither's office it belonged to zahra. but the analysis did not establish the cause of the girl's death. police began looking for zahra on october 9, 2010, after her stepmother reported her missing and authorities found a ransom note that was later determined to be fake. at the time, authorities said that no one other than a relative had seen the girl since september 25. elisa baker was arrested the next day on several charges unrelated to zahra's disappearance, including writing worthless checks. 2011: stepmother charged with murder meanwhile, the search for the young girl grabbed national and international headlines given her story, her age and the fact both of her biological parents are from australia. a prosthetic leg thought to belong to the missing girl was found in a brushy area off a north carolina road in late october 2010. some of her other remains were found november 11 of that year. zahra's stepmother eventually told police the girl had been killed two weeks before she was reported missing. in september 2011, she pleaded guilty to second-degree murder with aggravating factors and was sentenced to 18 years in state prison, according to the district attorney's office. according to an indictment, elisa baker ""desecrated the victim's body to hinder detection, investigation and prosecution of the offense."" she is now in federal custody awaiting sentencing on drug conspiracy charges after pleading guilty in january 2012 to one count of conspiracy to sell drugs. 2011: search warrants provide grisly details in zahra baker's death",zahra baker lost her left leg at age 5 and her hearing as she battled cancer
"georgian president mikheil saakashvili conceded his party's defeat tuesday, setting the stage for the nation's first peaceful, democratic transition through election since the breakup of the soviet union. victory in the parliamentary elections went to a coalition headed by billionaire businessman bidzina ivanishvili. ivanishvili is set to become the next prime minister. saakashvili will remain president until presidential elections next year. the result of monday's election means georgia will have a multi-party parliament, boosting democracy in the nation, observers said. the vote also is a reflection of how the people feel about saakashvili. he took power in 2004 after the rose revolution, the name given to widespread protests over disputed parliamentary elections. saakashvili is credited with having changed the country by moving toward integration with the west, with steps such as seeking membership in the european union and nato. he also revamped the nation's economy, retooling it to reflect a free market system. but critics said that beneath the surface, his government was dominated by soviet-style ""administrative measures."" ivanishvili, whose georgian dream alliance won a majority of seats in the 150-member parliament, said the new government would seek to mend the country's troubled relations with russia. the two nations fought a brief but bitter war four years ago over the breakaway region of south ossetia. ""restoring relations with the kremlin is one of our main tasks and we will strive in every way to do this,"" he told cnn. ""i think it's achievable but not easy. first we have to convince the kremlin that our strategy toward nato and europe is not harmful to and does not contradict russian interests."" nato ambitions his coalition shares the outgoing government's ambitions to join the nato alliance, he said. russia and georgia would also need to work together in the future to resolve the issue of separatist territories, ivanishvili said. ""the caucasus is a very complex and explosive region. i think, here, we will find common interests in the future,"" he said. in a statement released by his office, saakashvili said he would assist the transition to a new government and that his party, the united national movement, would now assume the role of the main opposition. ""it is well known to you that for us, and for me personally, the ideas of the coalition are fundamentally unacceptable. there are very deep differences between us, and we think that they are extremely wrong,"" he said. ""however, democracy works so that the georgian people make decisions by majority and this is what we hugely respect."" saakashvili paid tribute to the country's achievements over the past eight years, citing progress in fighting crime and corruption as well as in building new institutions, and said his party would fight in opposition to protect those advances. russian prime minister dmitry medvedev said the results indicate the people of georgia want change. ""if these results become a reality, then the georgian political landscape will be more diverse,"" he said. ""it should be welcome because it probably means that more responsible and constructive forces are entering the parliament."" cnn ireporter andro kiknadze, 31, shot video of jubilant opposition voters waving flags and honking car horns near freedom square in the georgian capital, tbilisi. he said he had voted for saakashvili because he thought the president stabilized the country. ""many things have changed since he came to power,"" kiknadze said. ""we are more stable and peaceful than before."" the united states hailed the election as a ""significant step in the consolidation of georgian democracy."" ""georgian citizens have set a regional and global example by conducting a competitive campaign, freely exercising their democratic rights, and affirming their commitment to undertake a peaceful transfer of power,"" the white house said in a statement, adding that much work remains in coming days and months. the vote in the parliamentary election had not been fully tallied, with georgia's central electoral commission continuing to count. the commission's performance has been lauded as professional and independent, said lorne craner, president of the international republican institute, a democracy support organization funded by the u.s. congress. ""there's no question in my mind ... the election commission can be relied upon,"" he said from tbilisi. ireporter jonathan hackett, an american teacher living in the imereti region in central georgia, said the scene was calm monday night and tuesday morning, despite the large amount of support for saakashvili in the region. ""it turns out the election was considered free and fair, at least in our little village,"" he said. ""people were gathered outside the local convenience store discussing the outcome."" power shift to prime minister the new system will shift power from the president to the new prime minister, according to thomas de waal, an expert on georgia and a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for international peace in washington. ""the prime minister will be chosen by parliament, which thus hands important powers to whichever political force obtains a majority in parliament in the ... elections,"" de waal said. until recently, saakashvili and the united national movement have controlled much of the political life in this country of 4.5 million people. saakashvili has been praised by u.s. and european officials for making progress in the fight against corruption and for continuing economic reform. but critics, who coalesced behind ivanishvili, said reform was only skin deep, and charged that saakashvili has been pulling all the levers of soviet-style ""administrative measures."" during the election campaign, they raised concerns about a level playing field for the opposition, alleging harassment and limitations over access to the media. money was also a major issue during the campaign, experts said. observers: georgia opposition may be premature in declaring victory for example, the government tried to regulate how much could be spent on corporate contributions and that affected how much ivanishvili could spend. ""i think that the government, at times, overstepped when it created an entity called the chamber of control and fines to watch over these new regulations,"" said stephen nix, the director of eurasia at the international republican institute and an expert on georgia. ""this means, overall, that there is a closer approach to democracy which will be felt about one year from now, in october 2013, when a presidential election happens,"" nix added, speaking from tbilisi. high stakes in polarized election for his part, saakashvili has referred to the opposition leader ivanishvili as that ""big money guy."" the president accused ivanishvili of wanting to ""buy the whole system,"" and said he saw behind him the hand of russia. the president said he was concerned by the amount of wealth that ivanishvili has accrued in russia, and whether that money was used to influence the elections. ""we know what russian money is all about,"" he said. ""how it was made, what kind of methods were used, and certainly it is a source of concern,"" he said. false stereotypes, ivanishvili says a self-made businessman who made his money in russia after the fall of the soviet union, ivanishvili left russia shortly after vladimir putin came to power. his staff confirms his status as georgia's richest man, with a fortune estimated at approximately $6.4 billion, equal to almost half of georgia's economic output. but he said ""it's not money and wealth which is my capital. it's trust from the people toward me. money has nothing to do with this."" the billionaire said he had sold all his russian assets, and defended his reputation. but saakashvili insisted that not only ivanishvili but putin himself was trying to undermine georgia. ""vladimir putin said clearly that he is interested in the georgian election outcome. he clearly said that he wanted the georgian government out. he clearly said that he wanted me to be physically destroyed, he said it publicly,"" saakashvili said. georgia's electoral waters were roiled by a shocking video that emerged last month showing abuse in a georgian prison, including one male prisoner being sexually assaulted. the opposition claimed the video was proof of a repressive system put in place by saakashvili and his government. former georgian prison guard: i witnessed abuse for years saakashvili said his government had responded quickly and decisively to the video, citing an investigation that has led to arrests. ""not only were the immediate perpetrators arrested,"" he said, ""but two government ministers resigned because they shared political responsibility for allowing the system to fail."" read more: georgia interior minister quits over prisoner abuse videos the torture shown on the video is no accident, but part of a system that is shameful, ivanishvili said. de waal said the video is significant, as the prison population has quadrupled over the past eight or nine years. ""i do think it (the video) supports the opposition narrative that the government is arrogant and unaccountable. and this is obviously a war of two narratives over georgia that we're seeing in this election,"" he said.","""restoring relations with the kremlin is one of our main tasks,"" ivanishvili says"
"-- when the world bank's arbitration body weighs in on a dispute between venezuela and exxonmobil, president hugo chavez says he won't respect the decision. the oil giant and officials from the south american nation have been feuding since 2007, when chavez's government nationalized a joint project in the country's crude-rich orinoco belt. a case before the world bank's international centre for settlement of investment disputes (icsid) is pending. ""i will say it once. we will not recognize any decisions of the icsid. we will not recognize them,"" chavez said on state television sunday. a hearing in the icsid case is scheduled for the first quarter of 2012, according to a summary of the dispute published in an exxon financial report. last week venezuela's state oil company pdvsa said it would pay exxonmobil $255 million after the paris-based international chamber of commerce ruled that venezuela owes exxonmobil $907 million. past debts and asset seizures make up the difference, officials from pdvsa said in a statement. chavez criticized exxonmobil, which has asked for billions of dollars in compensation, for continuing with the case. ""since they couldn't do it in paris, now they are going to the icsid in the united states,"" he said. exxonmobil affiliates filed the icsid arbitration case against venezuela in september 2007 over the cerro negro project, which was a joint venture until the venezuelan government took over exxonmobil's 42% interest in june of that year. exxonmobil has argued that pdvsa breached obligations under an investment treaty. venezuela argued that taking over the project and others in orinoco belt was its sovereign right. chavez, who has nationalized numerous industries and land holdings during his 13-year tenure, said sunday that he supported ecuadorian president rafael correa's proposal to create a new arbitration body ""where we can settle whatever differences there are between governments and companies in latin america."" venezuela -- along with allies bolivia and nicaragua -- has said in the past that it would withdraw from the convention that created the icsid, arguing that the international body gives transnational companies a gateway to violate national sovereignty. chavez repeated those concerns sunday, saying the arbitration panel was being used to threaten his country. ""they are trying to achieve the impossible, that we pay them what we are never going to pay,"" he said. world bank directors devised the international arbitration panel in 1965. more than 140 countries are members, according to a statement on the icsid website, which describes the body as an ""autonomous international institution."" cnn''s catherine e. shoichet and journalist osmary hernandez contributed to this report.",venezuela and exxonmobil are feuding over the 2007 nationalization of a project
"-- a day after the most high-profile assassination in lebanon in more than seven years, accusations over who's responsible homed in on the syrian regime of bashar al-assad. prime minister najib mikati, a billionaire supported by hezbollah, announced saturday that he plans to stay in power, despite having offered his resignation to appease those who claimed al-assad was behind friday's car bombing that killed lebanon's intelligence chief, brig. gen wissam al-hassan. ""to hold me personally responsible for the assassination is unfair,"" he told reporters. ""i have always respected and admired al-hassan, who has done great things for lebanon."" mikati's decision to stay heads off a power vacuum in lebanon's government, as sectarian tensions flare particularly as the effects of syria's 19-month civil war spill across borders and threaten the region. don't know who is who in lebanon? a guide to key players the senior lebanese security official and at least nine others died in the explosion in the typically peaceful and cosmopolitan ashrafiyeh district of east beirut. the attack -- in broad daylight, at one of the capital's busiest intersections -- left a crater more than a meter deep and was just the kind of thing al-hassan had worked to prevent. but beyond its potential impact on lebanon's security, al-hassan's life and death illustrates the deep political and religious fissures within lebanese society, believed to be exacerbated by its neighbor's internal conflict, where at least another 123 people were killed saturday amid fighting that has left tens of thousands dead. saad hariri, a lebanese opposition leader and former prime minister, told cnn that he had no doubt that the syrian leader was responsible for friday's deadly strike. hariri accused al-assad of ""killing his own people"" and said ""he will not think twice"" about killing lebanese in order to protect himself. ""the message from damascus today is anywhere you are, if you are against the regime from lebanon, we will come and get you. ... no matter what you try to do, we will keep on assassinating the lebanese,"" said hariri, who blames the 2005 assassination of his father, former prime minister rafik hariri, on the assad government. lebanon on edge after attack syrian armed forces opened fire from across the border on anti-al-assad and anti-hezbollah protesters in northern lebanon, the lebanese state-run national news agency reported. the protesters burned al-assad's effigy and hezbollah flags before being fired upon, nna reported, citing its reporters at the scene. walid jumblatt, a druze politician and influential power broker in lebanon's rough-and-tumble political landscape, also echoed hariri's comments. jumblatt told cnn he blames friday's murder on the assad government and has expressed concerns over his own safety. he said the syrian-backed murderers of al-hassan ""can hit you any place anywhere."" ""i don't feel safe,"" he added, talking to cnn in his hillside home outside the capital. when asked if he thought al-hassan's killers would be captured, jumblatt replied: ""sometimes you have justice -- i mean procedural justice according to the rules, and sometimes you have natural justice when one day the killer will be killed. one day the killer will die. you just have to be patient and one day you will see your enemy floating in front of you in the river."" under assad, syria has continued to influence the politics of its smaller neighbor despite withdrawing troops from lebanon in 2005 following rafik hariri's assassination. last year, damascus maneuvered to topple hariri's son saad as prime minister by persuading jumblatt to abandon the majority coalition in parliament, which left hezbollah to play kingmaker in protracted negotiations to form a new government. tensions have since boiled over in lebanon following friday's attack as enraged citizens blocked roads and clashes erupted in the port city of tripoli between supporters and foes of syria's government. the lebanese president declared saturday a day of national mourning in decrying the ""abominable crime"" in a statement. but the prime minister's failure to appear publicly after the explosion elicited criticism, including from one protester in beirut who said, ""this government is killing us by not doing anything. it is not acting like a government. it is like a ghost government."" the u.n. security council also weighed in friday, calling for ""the perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of this crime"" to be brought to justice. cnn's nick paton walsh contributed to this report from beirut","new: syrian forces open fire on anti-al-assad protesters across border, state media reports"

""these rumors that she was anorexic? it's crazy -- she was slim, but that was her natural physique,"" monjack told people. ""this is what's killing all of us? how did it happen? her mum, myself and her family -- we want to know why we lost our baby."" during a sometimes tear-filled interview, an exhausted monjack, 39, who hasn't slept since his mother-in-law found his wife collapsed in the bathroom early sunday, said all he knows is what doctors told him at the hospital: she died of cardiac arrest, but they won't know details until after an autopsy. (a coroner's spokesperson said the results could take up to six weeks, for toxicology reports to be final.) ""my initial reaction to the autopsy was -- they're going to cut her open -- i couldn't bear it,"" monjack said, weeping. ""that would break her mother, but we realized we needed to know. i look forward to getting the results."" he added that his wife of three years did suffer from a heart murmur (mitral valve prolapse), which can cause fatigue, dizziness and irregular heartbeats -- but is generally not life threatening. murphy didn't require medication to treat it, says monjack. but on saturday, he said, his wife was ill, resting in bed all day suffering from laryngitis, which the actress treated with herbal tea, ginger and lemon. ""she was on herbal remedies that wouldn't speed up her heart,"" monjack said. ""there was nothing here that could endanger her; there was prescription medication in the house for her female time and some cough syrup. that was it."" asked point-blank if a drug overdose was a possible cause of death, monjack replied, ""i can get rid of that one right now,"" he said. last saturday, the couple just relaxed in bed, watching three movies as murphy prepared to cast her vote as a member of the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences. they ordered brittany's favorite takeout -- thai food -- and ate soup prepared by murphy's mother, sharon, who has lived with them for 3½ years. ""she was tired and a little sad because she was sick,"" monjack said about brittany. ""she wore her pink beverly hills hotel robe and monkey pajamas. we saw it's complicated, public enemy and the princess and the frog. the couple were joined by murphy's companion, a pet maltese named clara, a christmas gift last year from monjack that murphy named after her favorite silent screen star, clara bow. ""one of the saddest things is that clara has looked everywhere for brittany and can't find her,"" said monjack. monjack, a photographer, first met murphy on a photo shoot when she was 13 after she moved to hollywood with her mother, sharon. they began dating after being reintroduced at murphy's 28th birthday party and married a year later. ""so many people have their views of us, but they never met us or sat down with us,"" he said. ""i'm not perfect, but i don't think anyone is ... i am feeling beyond devastated. i was in love with brittany and brittany with me."" the couple had plans for 2010: brittany would continue to work, but she wanted to get pregnant. ""she was an only child,"" said monjack. ""she wanted a baby. her big dream next year was to have a child, and we talked about how he or she would look. she'd say, 'they'd better have your eyes and lips and my hair.' "" but monjack did concede his wife was trying to get heavier. ""she tried to gain weight but had one of those metabolisms -- a high metabolism -- but enjoyed food as much as anyone. i wish i could show all the receipts from the take out restaurants,"" he said.

"-- if your company bans you from using twitter, facebook, linkedin and other social media in the office, that policy is ""brain dead"", entrepreneur vivek wadhwa told me. wadhwa, listed as one of the 40 most influential minds in tech, is right of course. and here are five reasons, borrowing from several books published this year. 1. it's self-defeating. dictatorial office managers be warned. banning social media at work is about as viable as king canute's attempts to halt the tide. as nicco mele argues in ""the end of big: howe the internet makes david the new goliath"", social media is actually contributing to the demise of the large organization. besides, since most workers now have their own smart phones and tablets, it's actually impossible -- without establishing an all-seeing totalitarian regime at the office -- to stop workers peeking a look at the their facebook updates or twitter feeds while in the restroom. 2. it's such an old idea. even the word ""banning"" is archaic. as moises naim argues in ""the end of power"", by undermining traditional hierarchies and gatekeepers, the internet makes it more and more difficult to outlaw anything. ""being in charge isn't what it used to be,"" he notes in the book's subtitle. middle eastern dictators should, of course, beware. but so should formerly all-powerful office it directors or hr managers whose monopoly of authority and power has been undermined by the worldwide web. like tahrir square, the 21st century office has been radically democratized. tightly controlled, top-down offices don't work anymore. they are so 20th century. 3. social media is the new coffee break. it's the 21st century version of the water cooler. it's how we get our news, keep up with friends and colleagues, make our social arrangements, establish our identities and view the world. our obsessive use of social media means that we are all living in the perpetual present, says cnn columnist douglas rushkoff in ""present shock: when everything happens now"". it's what social media gurus robert scoble and shel israel describe, in ""age of context"". as scoble notes, this social media rich environment, in which everything we do becomes ""social data"", is what he calls the ""new world"". this is both ""scary"" and ""freaky"", as scoble acknowledges. but it's an inevitable as self-driving cars or wearable computers. to ban social media, therefore, is to essentially ban people at work. it's like outlawing talking or laughing. you might as well ban breathing. 4. multitasking is beneficial. as anyone with children knows, multitasking is how digital natives live their hyper-connected lives. and the same is increasingly true at work. once upon a time, we sat in an office all day then went home to enjoy our leisure. but today, work and leisure are inextricably connected. so that occasional tweet or facebook update from the office doesn't mean you aren't working. it just means that some of your brain might be temporarily focused on something else. but that temporary focus describes the nature of 21st century work. it's how we all -- even the most efficient among us -- operate in the networked age. as jane mcgonigal notes in her best-seller ""reality is broken: why games make us better and how they can change the world"", multitasking actually makes us more creative by stimulating our playfulness. 5. it makes us more productive because it opens up our minds. social media not only enables us to group-solve big problems, but also makes us more literate, able to think with more independence and gives us an esp-like sense of what other people are thinking, according to clive thompson in ""smarter than you think: how technology is changing our minds for the better"". through twitter, we get access to newspaper articles and stories that we would otherwise have missed. linkedin enables us to network with fellow workers. facebook gives us intelligence about competitive ideas and companies. and banning social media at work only empowers that intelligence even more by encouraging us to network with more open-minded and innovative companies. the futurecast conference brought together entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, writers and technologists to imagine the future of 21st century digital society. it was organized and produced by andrew keen and was hosted by at&t and ericsson at at&t's palo alto foundry.","bosses should be relaxed about employees going on social media at work, says andrew keen"
"-- germany may be america's most important european ally, but the relationship between the two countries is on the rocks. on thursday, germany expelled a top cia agent from berlin, a highly unusual move for which the german government cited a ""lack of cooperation"" from the united states in clarifying recent spying cases. those cases include revelation that the cia tried to recruit a german secret service staffer to sell classified information, and the possibility that a german defense ministry employee had been working for u.s. intelligence. german policymakers and journalists are up in arms, with u.s. diplomats struggling to contain the political damage. in a recent poll, only 35% of germans said the united states can be trusted. this is a stunning vote of no confidence amid continued public uproar about the nsa's tapping of chancellor angela merkel's cell phone. for those dedicated to the trans-atlantic alliance, the current atmosphere is more depressing than during the height of the iraq war, when chancellor gerhard schroeder and president george w. bush made no secret of their antipathy. long gone are times like when 200,000 germans cheered for candidate barack obama as he spoke under berlin's victory column in summer 2008. gone, too, are obama's 75% approval ratings among germans. the united states has very few friends in berlin these days. even traditionally pro-american policy- and opinion-makers keep a low profile, and almost no one is prepared to publicly defend the united states. many say they are fed up with america's explanations and excuses, and it is hard to blame them. in contrast, those in germany who argue that the country should pursue an even course between the united states and russia, instead of partnering with the united states, are in ""i told you so"" mode, saying that americans are not worthy of a trusting relationship. legitimate criticism of intelligence overreach is now solidifying into genuine anti-american sentiment, with deeply corrosive effects on bilateral ties. germans are very sensitive about data protection. this is rooted in stalinist and nazi traditions of comprehensive surveillance and terror. but that's only part of the story. many in the german business community are trying to protect their investments in russia from u.s.-led sanctions. a new generation of germans in their 20s and 30s know the united states only in its post-9/11 guise: afghanistan, iraq, surveillance, fingerprinting at the borders, spying on friendly nations and their leaders, renditions and targeted killings. it is not uncommon to hear young germans ask: ""what makes the u.s. different from russia or china?"" it is easy to dismiss such distorted perceptions, but they matter. america is increasingly seen as a paranoid society that cannot distinguish between friends and foes anymore. this perception is eroding america's standing in the world. as one berlin policymaker suggested: ""the u.s. is digging its own grave with regard to its global leadership aspirations."" in addition, there is a widespread feeling among government officials, scholars and businessmen that the united states ""still doesn't get it"" and is not prepared to seriously discuss the rules of engagement when it comes to surveillance of close allies. we should not underestimate the damage this perception has already inflicted. during the iraq war, many germans rationalized their discontent with u.s. policy by separating the likes of george bush, dick cheney, donald rumsfeld and paul wolfowitz -- bad apples in their minds -- from what they saw as the ""good americans."" this time, german disappointment and anger is proportionate to the high expectations of the obama era. many just say that the united states cannot and should not be trusted anymore, and that any special relationship is gone for good. germany has reacted this week partly from genuine anger and partly in response to public opinion. u.s. ambassador john emerson was summoned to the german foreign office just hours before the large annual fourth of july reception at the american embassy. it was ""nothing that we liked to do but it was necessary,"" said one german official. members of the governing coalition are openly asking to expel u.s. intelligence personnel from germany and order the bnd (germany's foreign intelligence agency) to cease all cooperation with u.s. services. even german president joachim gauck, usually a measured man, could not resist making a populist ""enough is enough"" statement. the current turmoil is reversing modest gains that have been made by the cyber dialogue established by the white house with the german government in the wake of the national security agency revelations. the first meeting took place on june 26 in berlin, ending a day before news broke that the cia attempted to recruit a junior bnd agent. so much for dialogue. for the united states, references to ongoing internal review will not cut it this time. as annoying as public debates in germany might be to american leaders, the united states cannot afford to ignore them. the germans require a serious conversation about national interest, the trans-atlantic partnership, and intelligence gathering. this will be mutually beneficial, as it will force germans to make up their mind as to what role they want to play and perhaps help the united states establish a true cost-benefit analysis of its intelligence activities.",germany expelled a top cia agent from berlin in light of recent spying cases
"-- mclaren driver lewis hamilton believes he is back in the fight for the 2011 formula one world championship after claiming a much-needed victory at sunday's german grand prix. the 26-year-old headed home ferrari's fernando alonso and mark webber of red bull to secure his second maximum-points haul this season and the 16th of his career. the briton trails world champion and current standings leader sebastian vettel of red bull by 82 points, and is fourth in the drivers' championship, but hamilton is confident he is back in contention for the title he claimed in 2008. ""the fight for the world championship will be very, very, very hard now,"" hamilton, who started the race second on the grid behind the australian webber, told mclaren's official website. hamilton reigns in germany ""we're back in the fight though, and i really hope we can carry this forward and keep the momentum going."" hamilton spent large parts of the nurburgring race battling at close quarters with both webber and the spaniard alonso, and he felt the intense competition helped him to perform at his best.

"-- raymond j. clark iii, charged with murder in the death of yale graduate student annie le, was smart, amiable and loved his dog, say those who knew him. raymond clark iii was arrested thursday and charged with murder in the death of annie le. one researcher said he often went by the lab in the yale school of medicine building where le was found strangled and stuffed in a wall. lufeng zhang worked with clark, he said, and thinks the police may have the wrong man. ""he's a nice man, always,"" he said. clark, 24, the same age as le, was a technician in the school of medicine's animal resources center. while le, who was pursuing a doctorate in pharmacology, conducted experiments on mice, clark took care of the rodents and cleaned their cages. police will not say whether clark and le were acquainted or why they homed in on clark after le went missing september 8, less than a week before she was scheduled to marry a columbia university graduate student who was her college sweetheart. watch police announce arrest » ""they work in the same building, passed in the hallways,"" new haven police chief james lewis said of le and clark.

""his dog was very excited and he was just like, 'oh, don't worry. he's friendly.' you could pet him,"" she said.

"-- the texas town of groesbeck is on the verge of running dry. ""we have about two weeks of water left,"" groesbeck mayor jackie levingston said. her central texas town, population 4,300, is one of the latest victim's of the state's ongoing drought. a lack of rain and the summer's intense heat -- more than 90 days of triple-digit temperatures -- combined to dry out the groesbeck water supply. ""we lost more water to evaporation than we were using this summer,"" levingston said in a telephone interview. fort parker lake is the city's primary source of water. heat evaporation took roughly 731 million gallons of water from the lake. the city used only 54 million. groesbeck residents spent monday waiting on the texas department of parks and wildlife to approve an emergency three-mile pipeline to divert water off the navasota river, using a public creek as a stop-gap to shorten the distance. ""our water comes from a river, that goes into a lake, then comes down a river. we came up with a plan to go around the lake,"" said the mayor. the city already has approval from another agency, the texas quality commission on environmental quality, for seven miles of alternative pipeline, but with the clock ticking, levington said residents can't afford the two weeks to lay the piping in the approved plan. the new plan will take the city four days to construct. ""i might as well be optimistic,"" the mayor said, laughing. there is a bit to be optimistic this week -- thanksgiving week. outside of the local federal prison, the school district is the biggest water user. some 1,600 children -- many from outside the city limits in surrounding limestone county -- draw on groesbeck's water supply on school days. but schools are out for the holiday this week. ""we are counting on this to extend our usage,"" said levingston. she speculates it may buy the town an extra week. the pipeline, when it happens, is a temporary fix. it will cost $200,000 in construction, and $35,000 per month on pipe rental. the city is calculating using it for six months even though officials have drought-forecast beyond that. the city also is contracting with a well driller out of austin to search for ground water.","like much of texas, the town of groesbeck suffered through a summer of intense heat"

"-- a florida police department is investigating one of its officers after he shot a 61-year-old woman in the back with a taser on tuesday afternoon. the incident was captured on videotape by a nearby witness. officer terry mahan of the tallahassee police department and other officers responded to complaints about open-air drug sales in the area, the police department said in a statement wednesday. probable-cause affidavits paint a scene in which officers feared for their safety because of angry residents berating police and calling others to the scene. police had detained three people when viola young ""approached the police car inquiring about one of the individuals arrested,"" the statement said. ""an officer advised her to stay back, and a second officer approached young and attempted to place her under arrest."" in the video, young can be seen yanking her arm out of mahan's grasp before turning and walking in the opposite direction. she takes only a few steps before the officer fires a taser cartridge into young's back. the woman collapses face-down on the pavement, then rolls over onto her back. another police officer approaches young and arrests her. in a narrative included in a probable-cause affidavit, mahan wrote that he went to the scene after officers there called for backup. when he got there, he saw two officers engaged with two suspects on the ground, and ""there was a crowd of people that had gathered around them and were yelling at the officers,"" he wrote. as mahan put one arrested suspect in the back of a patrol car, young pulled up, forcing mahan ""to take [his] focus off of one of the arrestees and engage her,"" mahan said in his report. ""young's actions obstructed officers while in the course of completing their legal duties,"" he wrote. mahan told young to leave. she responded that she wanted to know what was going, but mahan told her, ""now was not the time for that,"" and instructed her to leave again. she refused, he wrote. ""i informed viola young that she was under arrest and reached out and took her left arm. young yanked away, turned and began to move away from me in an attempt to defeat her lawful arrest,"" mahan wrote. ""i deployed my taser, and fired one cartridge striking young in the back. young was incapacitated and fell to the ground."" mahan took young into custody ""without any further resistance,"" he wrote in his report. texas student tased by police exits coma, enters rehabilitation from another officer's narrative, it appears police had to leave soon after the arrests ""due to the hostility of the individuals remaining at the scene."" young was medically cleared by leon county emergency medical services before being sent to the leon county jail, along with the other three individuals arrested, police said. none of the four faces drug-related charges. they all were charged with resisting an officer without violence, and laguna young was charged with a probation violation that leon county jail records indicate stems from a previous conviction on cocaine and drug paraphernalia charges. family wants answers in florida teen's death after tasering laguna young was the only one of the four who had not been released as of wednesday afternoon. it's not clear if laguna young, 41, is related to viola young. after reviewing the video of the tasing incident, tallahassee police chief michael deleo called for an internal investigation, he said. ""we will conduct a thorough investigation into this incident. we want to be transparent with the community by sharing what we can at this point, including the video,"" deleo said in a statement. mahan has been placed on administrative leave with pay while the investigation is being conducted, deleo said. because the case is now part of an internal affairs investigation, ""this will preclude us from making any other statements, other than what is in our release, in regards to this case until the full investigation is complete,"" police spokesman officer david northway said. using a taser on an 8-year-old? mom sues police, city",incident began when police responded to complaints of open-air drug sales in area
"-- with a climate that ranges from desert dry to tropical lush to freeze-your-north-face-off in the andes, peru packs a ton of diversity between its sea level elevation pacific beaches and the 22,204 foot top of its highest mountain, nevado huascaran. there's pisco. there's ceviche. and, yes, there's that famous trail. don't worry, we'll get to all of those. first some things you may not already know. peruvian food: from guinea pigs to pisco sours 1. lima is worth seeing while most international travelers land in peru's current capital, many immediately continue on to the country's former capital, cuzco, in their rush to get to machu picchu. that's a mistake. lima is peru's largest city by far. it's home to more than a quarter of peru's roughly 30 million people, has wonderful food, the beautiful miraflores district (where you can drink while overlooking beaches lined with small rocks that form eye-catching patterns each time the tide rolls out) and excellent museums. the museo larco and its erotic gallery is devoted to sculptures from more than a thousand years ago celebrating sexual congress in all of its least procreative forms. reproductions of these works pop up all over peru, notably in the form of a bottle of pisco shaped like a fellow in an extremely good mood. museo larco (larco museum), bolivar 1515, lima; +51 1 461 1312 2. you're gonna love the ceviche fresh, raw fish marinated in citrus juices and spiced with chili peppers and sometimes other tongue-tingling spices, ceviche is peru's most popular dish, a must-try for any visitor. in lima, internationally famed la mar is a great place to try it, but ceviche is prepared differently throughout the country, from humble street stalls to elegant restaurants. la mar, 770 av. la mar, lima; +51 1 421 3365 3. there's more to peru than incas most tourists come to peru to see machu picchu or other inca ruins, with maybe a few catholic churches thrown in for balance. this makes it easy to conclude, ""there were the incas, then the spanish came, which brings us to where we are now."" in fact, the inca were a bit like mitt romney's bain capital: they had a knack for taking control of long-established things and making them their own. the incan state didn't emerge until the 1200s. it became an empire in the 1400s, and its final sovereign emperor died in 1533, officially ending the period of constructing the buildings and roads that lure visitors to this day. that said, the norte chico people of peru built a civilization 5,000 years ago and the centuries that followed saw the emergence of other significant cultures, such as the paracas and the moche. was the incan era a highlight of peruvian history? unquestionably. but when peruvian museums boast artifacts from before christ, focusing exclusively on atahualpa and his predecessors is akin to being so impressed by books that you conclude world history began with the gutenberg press. 4. pisco rules peru's beverage of choice is pisco, a brandy made from grapes. it's also adored in chile, inspiring an epic rivalry over which nation is its true birthplace. available in numerous brands at varying prices, pisco is usually consumed in cocktail form, meaning other ingredients largely hide its nuances, which can be a good thing for novices unaccustomed to pisco's blowtorch nuances. the most famous cocktail is the pisco sour, consisting of lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, ice and angostura bitters. there are assorted variations, such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness. if you'd rather just have a beer, you're in luck -- the local brews are good, with cusqueã±a being a particularly refreshing option. 5. cash is king, ideally in small bills travelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that won't take mastercard or visa, much less american express. peru offers an extra twist: occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them. in general, peruvians like their soles (the currency is the nuevo sol) in small denominations: a fifty (roughly $20) is ok, but denominations of twenty and under are better to ensure merchants can make change. that noted, peruvians tend to put great stock in u.s. dollars, so even if an establishment doesn't take credit cards and you don't see an atm, you may still be able to buy dinner or souvenirs. make sure your u.s. and other foreign currency is in pristine shape -- many merchants and hotels will reject torn or overly worn bills. 6. altitude adjustment amounts to common sense peru is a mountainous land, and you have to handle heights if you're going to cuzco, machu picchu and other landmarks of incan culture. how to prepare? the easiest method is drink lots of water, get plenty of sleep and ease off the booze -- just imagine how your mother would like you to conduct your life at every elevation and you'll be fine. you can also consume stimulating coca leafs, whether in tea or by chewing them. 7. the plumbing requires some tlc expect to see trashcans in bathrooms next to the toilet. while peruvian plumbing handles your waste, it doesn't do toilet paper, which must be put in the bin next to the bowl. some bathrooms have signs stating this rule, others assume you know: remember and spare yourself begging for a plunger in broken spanish. 8. the inca trail is genuinely difficult along the famed trail you'll often be reminded of the peruvian proverb: ""when the road is long, even slippers feel tight."" the inca trail largely consists of stone stairs -- often steep ones -- and those stone stairs weren't meant to be covered by mortals. the result is that the steps feel quite high for those who don't answer to ""kobe"" or ""lebron."" if just reading this makes your knees swell, you may be in trouble. in addition, while altitude sickness tends to be exaggerated, there'll come a moment when you're going up a hill and find that your lungs have betrayed you. throw in the chance of heavy rains -- test your ""waterproof"" gear pretrek to make sure it's just that -- and the trail can feel less like vacation than boot camp. 9. there are ways to ease your inca pain depending on the company guiding you on the trail, it's possible to get porters to carry your tent, sleeping bag, food and ... well, they'll essentially carry everything, including you, should your body completely fall to pieces. porters race ahead to the night's camp and assemble everything before parties arrive, then cook and serve multiple-course meals, in certain cases on white linen table clothes. the result after a hard day's walk is that you feel like you've stepped out of ""deliverance"" and into ""howard's end."" speaking of porters ... 10. porters are the toughest guys in the country whether you're on your own or traveling like an english lord in the colonies, you'll encounter porters on the inca trail. these men tend to be farmers or laborers looking to earn extra money. they carry up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of gear -- the weight limit is a recent development, they used to handle positively spine-shattering loads -- and they carry it fast. some actually run along the trail, somehow avoiding shredded ankles as they navigate uneven, wet stones just to ensure all's ready before the tourists stagger into camp. if you feel like racing your fellow hikers, great. do not test the porters: they're pros, and you're at best a promising amateur.",the country of some 30 million is incredibly diverse
"-- a campus police officer who sprayed seated protesters with pepper spray during a police attempt to clear out an occupy encampment at the university of california davis last year no longer works at the school, a university spokeswoman said. but she declined to specify whether the officer, lt. john pike, quit or was let go. ""we can confirm he is no longer employed as of today ... but we cannot confirm anything else because of privacy guidelines,"" said claudia morain, news service director at u.c. davis. video footage of pike spraying student demonstrators in november 2011 with the irritant at close range went viral online, provoking widespread criticism of school authorities and making him the brunt of internet ridicule. the group of about a dozen protesters had sat down on a path with their arms interlocked as the police moved in to clear out the occupy encampment. police officers forcibly removed the demonstrators after they had been sprayed. uc-davis placed pike, a second officer and campus police chief annette spicuzza on administrative leave after the incident. the pepper-spraying was an ""objectively unreasonable"" use of force by the campus police, a 190-page report by a university of california task force said in april. the report also accused pike of misusing his now-iconic weapon. the bright red pepper-spray canister he brandished to the crowd before discharging was ""not an authorized weapon"" under campus police guidelines, and ""is a higher pressure type of pepper spray than what officers normally carry on their utility belts."" it was designed to be used at a distance of at least six feet. ""and lt. pike did not use it correctly,"" the report found. the task force also blamed members of the uc-davis leadership, citing ""systemic and repeated failures"" among campus administrators that ""put officers in the unfortunate situation in which they found themselves."" it described the campus police command structure as ""very dysfunctional,"" with spicuzza's lieutenants refusing to follow orders and getting into ""heated exchanges"" with the chief during the protests. but pike was primarily responsible for the ""objectively unreasonable decision"" to pepper-spray the demonstrators, it concluded. pranksters across the internet have inserted the image of the helmeted policeman into famous paintings, photos and movie scenes, while the hacking collective anonymous published his home and cell phone numbers online.",officer who sprayed seated protesters no longer works at the university
"-- there is an old joke in the middle east that goes like this: one of hosni mubarak's advisers finally gets the courage to say, ""mr. president, maybe it's time to think about your farewell address to the egyptian people."" mubarak looks at the adviser and asks, ""why? where are they going?"" in reality, mubarak got the message loud and clear. now, this leader, who for decades has been not just the symbol of egypt but a dominant voice in the middle east, will be leaving, and nobody is sure what will emerge in his wake. the effects will be felt not just in the middle east but back in the united states. today, the u.s. has less leverage in the region than ever before. at talks last month in istanbul, turkey, iran showed the u.s. and its allies that it will remain defiant on its nuclear program in the face of tough sanctions. lebanon is in the throes of a dangerous game of brinksmanship that threatens to send the country back into civil war after hezbollah, supported by syria and iran, brought down the u.s.-backed government of prime minister saad hariri and installed billionaire businessman najib mikati as its choice for the job. in yemen, a strongman president has been ejected, but he was also key to u.s. anti-terror efforts in the country that harbors an active and threatening subset of al qaeda. reform in the middle east was an important item at the outset for the obama administration. president obama received international goodwill upon taking office, for simply not being president george w. bush. he flew to cairo early in his tenure and gave a much-watched speech to offer a ""new era"" in u.s. relations with the arab and muslim world. that was the high point. although it came into office hoping to seduce the region rather than fight it, the obama administration has not delivered on the tantalizing promises it made since taking over, not only to show progress on solving the israeli-palestinian conflict but to encourage democratic reform. change in the region comes not from his encouragement but from the disaffected taking matters into their own hands. these dashed expectations obama has created in the region are not just disappointing; they have hurt u.s. credibility in the region and have had diplomats and middle east experts scratching their heads about just what obama's vision for the region is. this troubled region has always looked to the u.s. to help in times of crisis. now, countries like turkey and qatar, whose interests don't always align with washington's, are taking the lead. while its influence on big-ticket issues in the region is declining, the u.s. has redoubled efforts to tackle their root causes, such as poverty, hunger and disenfranchisement of women. these are the same ills that prompted tunisians to take to the streets, with people in the neighborhood nipping at their heels. sensing the winds of change in the region, the obama administration has been engaged in a robust debate over the past few months about whether to elevate the issue of reform. the answer was delivered in a speech last month in qatar by secretary of state hillary clinton, in which she warned arab leaders that unless they reform and address economic and social frustrations, their regimes would ""sink into the sand."" the fall of president zine el abidine ben ali in tunisia and the events in egypt caught u.s. officials off-guard and brought that debate to critical mass. for the first time in history, the u.s. has broken with authoritarian arab allies. the events in egypt have leaders of other pro-u.s. countries in the region rightly concerned about what will happen if demonstrations take place in their countries and whether they can count on america's loyalty. the obama administration is trying to send the message to these countries -- but not necessarily their leaders -- that they can count on american loyalty. for years, a game ensued in which the u.s. called for reform and arab leaders resorted to cosmetic and ad hoc changes to placate washington, which accepted the meager gestures in the hopes they would lead to further changes. that game is over. obama's decision to break with mubarak, a critical u.s. ally in the mideast, serves as a warning to arab allies that they too are expendable and their reactions to u.s. calls for reform in the future must be met more seriously. although the u.s. has finally found its footing on the reform issue, its aspirations of restarting mideast peace talks between israelis and palestinians may be stalled indefinitely. mubarak was an anchor of u.s. policy of stability in the region. the twin pillars of that policy -- support for pro-american regimes that share u.s. security interests and the pursuit of israeli-arab peace -- are now on shaky ground. israel will probably conclude that if such entrenched arab regimes can fall, making peace with a deeply divided palestinian movement is anything but a sure bet. israel is keeping a wary eye on developments in egypt with fears that an islamic takeover there would end three decades of cooperation between the two countries. the u.s.-brokered camp david accords, signed by israeli prime minister menachem begin and egyptian president anwar sadat in 1978, ended a generation of hostilities between the two nations and forged a relationship that has endured, in part, because of the stability of the mubarak regime -- which came to power after sadat was assassinated in 1981 -- and in spite of deep animus among rank-and-file egyptians toward israel. eli shaked, israel's ambassador to egypt from 2003 to 2005, predicted that if the mubarak regime falls, a new islamist regime, hostile to israel and western nations, will replace it. ""there will be no democracy in egypt,"" shaked said. ""if there will be democratic elections in egypt in the summer or in the very near future, (they) will be the first and last democratic elections in egypt."" while he recognizes that the causes of the upheaval in egypt lie in economic and social strife, israeli president benjamin netanyahu said he is concerned that ""there is a possibility that an organized force will take advantage of the situation."" a new egyptian regime probably will affect relations with hamas, which controls the palestinian territory sandwiched between israel and egypt, and may play up the harsh criticism among many sectors in egyptian society toward israeli policy. but some terrorism experts believe that extremist voices are being drowned out by the chants of the protesters in cairo. cnn analyst paul cruickshank wrote that al qaeda's support base, ""already severely shaken by its barbaric excesses in iraq and biting criticism from fellow jihadists, could narrow yet further."" ""the televised scenes of secular, middle-class youngsters and egyptians from all walks of life courageously and largely peacefully challenging the regime of president hosni mubarak have been transmitted onto tens of millions of television screens across the arab world and have captured the imagination, providing vastly more attractive role models for young arabs, whose hopes for too long have been strangled by political, economic and cultural sclerosis,"" he wrote. u.s. officials feel that the muslim brotherhood, egypt's main islamic political organization, has been very sophisticated in its handling of the people's revolt. the group deliberately stayed out of the fray in the early days of the protests, allowing other egyptians to lead the charge for fear mubarak would cite fears of extremist activity in cracking down on the demonstrators. carrie rosefsky wickham, an associate professor of political science at emory university and author of ""mobilizing islam: religion, activism and political change in egypt,"" notes that the brotherhood is an umbrella organization that encompasses different views and trends. though technically illegal, the group does have a presence among the masses, but it is no longer the defiant anti-system movement it was in the past. the key question is whether the brotherhood will continue to exercise self-restraint when the mubarak regime falls. rosefsky believes it will, arguing that the brotherhood is less interested in seizing power and calling the shots than it is in spreading its message and influencing policy. other experts believe the brotherhood will grab power if given the chance. it is unclear to what extent established institutions of egypt and other countries will be willing and able to change and open enough political space for viable oppositions to flourish. the future of u.s. policy and interests in the region will largely depend on who ends up in power, not just in egypt but in the host of other countries on the verge of transformation. in a doomsday scenario, extremist islamic factions in egypt, tunisia and even jordan could come to power, killing critical diplomatic and military relationships, forcing the closing of the suez canal and allowing iran fill the vacuum. that could even trigger a most dangerous war between israel and iran. nobody expects that worst-case nightmare to come through, however. regardless of the outcome, the obama administration has concluded that it must try to be on the right side of history, which is seems to be the catchphrase of the week for middle east analysts. supporting the status quo could embolden leaders to hold on, possibly becoming even more oppressive. that could give way to a permanent resistance that creates even more pressure for chance, further radicalizes the arab street and creates even more anger at the united states. this tectonic shifts taking place in the region have altered the american role in the middle east indefinitely, if not forever. for the first time in decades, the u.s. is in uncharted waters in the proverbial boat without a paddle. there is certain fatalism to it all, with the u.s. gradually accepting the hard reality that it can only be driven by events rather than helping to drive them. the hope is that the whoever the new leaders of the middle east are, they will look to washington as a partner. when asked how the u.s. will pick up the pieces in the region, one senior official simply said, ""we will call whoever is in charge.""",nobody is sure who will fill hosni mubarak's place when he steps down as egypt's president
"-- tokyoites may brag about having the most michelin stars in the world, but hong kongers can actually eat in theirs without breaking the bank. unveiled last week, the 2015 michelin guide to hong kong and macau awards 75 restaurants with its coveted stars -- 64 in hong kong and 11 in macau. bo innovation, l'atelier de joel robuchon, lung king heen, 8 ½ otto e mezzo-bombana, sushi shikon, robuchon au dome (macau) and the eight (macau) are once again crowned with three michelin stars. (all restaurants in this story are located in hong kong unless otherwise indicated.) but what makes hong kong special are the prices -- hong kong and macau are among the most affordable michelin lists in the world -- and variety. ""the selection in the 2015 guide also shows to what extent hong kong is increasingly attractive to young foreign chefs, more and more of whom are moving to the city,"" said michelin in a statement accompanying the release of the guide. ""hong kong has become an undisputed leader in the international culinary landscape."" starred cheap eats hong kong michelin guide mainstay tim ho wan (9-11 fuk wing st., sham shui po; +852 2788 1226) has long been known as the cheapest michelin-starred restaurant in the world. the humble establishment has now expanded to three branches and all receive one-star status in the 2015 guide. a dim sum meal at tim ho wan can easily cost less than $12. after losing its place in the guide last year, ho hung kee (shop 1204-05, 12/f, hysan place, 500 hennessy road, causeway bay; +852 2577 6060), celebrated for its $8 wonton noodle, returns in the 2015 guide with one star. serving roasted goose noodle for about $8, yat lok (34-38, stanley st., central; +852 2524 3882) advanced from the bib gourmand list to a one-star michelin pick. newbies on the list there are 15 new entries in the guide. some are also new to hong kong. notable newbs include seasons (one star), helmed by former executive chef of l'atelier de joel robuchon; and olivier elzer, open only since june (shop 308, 3/f, phase 2, lee garden, 2-38 yun ping road, causeway bay; +852 2505 6228). another new one-star entry is nur (3/f, 1 lyndhurst tower, lyndhurst terrace, central; +852 2871 9993), which opened in april. chef nurdin topham says the secret to snatching a star so quickly is differentiating itself from competitors. ""we are committed to finding local products from producers in the region and working with the best local farmers, which may be in contrast to other restaurants,"" says topham. ""(our) delivery cost is four times higher than normal."" topham says many ingredients take only 48 hours at the most to go from the farm to nur's tables. local celeb restaurateur hardy kam may have lost control of his renowned family restaurant yung kee -- after losing a high-profile court case involving the kam brothers -- but his new eatery, kam's roast goose (g/f, po wah commercial center, 226 hennessy road, wan chai; +852 25201110), was also awarded one star. the guide also includes 78 bib gourmand restaurants, eateries of good value and that cost less than hkd300 ($38). 2015 michelin guide hong kong three-star restaurants bo innovation (innovative) l'atelier de joel robuchon (french contemporary) lung king heen (cantonese) 8 ½ otto e mezzo -- bombana (italian) sushi shikon (sushi) two-star restaurants amber (french contemporary) caprice (french) celebrity cuisine (cantonese) duddell's (cantonese) pierre (french contemporary) ryu gin (japanese) shang palace (cantonese) summer palace (cantonese) sun tung lok (tsim sha tsui branch) (cantonese) t'ang court (cantonese) the principal (innovative) tin lung heen (cantonese) wagyu takumni (innovative) yan toh heen (cantonese) one-star restaurants ah yat harbour view (cantonese) akrame (french contemporary) ciak — in the kitchen (italian) fook lam moon (wan chai) (cantonese) forum (cantonese) fu ho (tsim sha tsui) (cantonese) golden leaf (cantonese) golden valley (chinese) guo fu lou (cantonese) ho hung kee (noodles and congee) jardin de jade (shanghainese) kam's roast goose (cantonese roast meats) kazuo okada (japanese) lei garden (ifc) (cantonese) lei garden (kowloon bay) (cantonese) lei garden (mong kok) (cantonese) lei garden (north point) (cantonese) lei garden (sha tin) (cantonese) lei garden (wan chai) (cantonese) loaf on (cantonese) man wah (cantonese) mandarin grill + bar (european contemporary) mic kitchen (innovative) ming court (cantonese) nur (innovative) pang's kitchen (cantonese) sai kung sing kee (seafood) seasons (french) spoon by alain ducasse (french) sushi ginza iwa (sushi) tate (innovative) the boss (cantonese) the square (cantonese) the steak house winebar + grill (steakhouse) tim ho wan (north point) (dim sum) tim ho wan (sham shui po) (dim sum) tim ho wan (tai kwok tsui) (dim sum) tosca (italian) upper modern bistro (french) wagyu kaiseki den (japanese) yat lok (cantonese roast meats) ye shanghai (tsim sha tsui) (shanghainese) yu lei (chinese) yuè (north point) (cantonese) zhejiang heen (shanghainese) 2015 michelin guide macau three-star restaurants robuchon au dome (french contemporary) the eight (chinese) two-star restaurants golden flower (chinese) zi yat heen (cantonese) one-star restaurants jade dragon (cantonese) king (cantonese) the golden peacock (indian) the kitchen (steakhouse) the tasting room (french contemporary) tim's kitchen (cantonese) wing lei (cantonese)",the 2015 michelin guide to hong kong and macau awards stars to 64 restaurants in hong kong and 11 in macau
"if you thought golf was the stuffy reserve of mild-mannered gentlemen in polo shirts, think again. from santa claus outfits to leaping into jacuzzis and even smashing lettuce heads to smithereens, there's no antic too crazy for new masters champion bubba watson. the 33-year-old born-again christian's bizarre internet home videos have attracted a cult following that could change the face of golf forever. ""wacky watson,"" as he's come to be known, has harnessed social media in a way no golf pro has done before. the american's slapstick-style youtube clips see him using wooden clubs to pound pumpkins and eggplants, drawing more than a million hits as of tuesday. similarly, bubba's facebook page has more than 65,000 likes, while his twitter followers number almost half a million -- ballooning by more than 150,000 since sunday's miraculous win at augusta. he still has some way to go to catch tiger woods, who has more than two million followers on both networking websites, but it could herald a brave new social media era for golf stars -- one which experts say may open the sport's doors to a previously ignored younger generation. ""golf has always been seen as a safe game. it's not overly flamboyant and i think it's still largely viewed as an elitist sport,"" christian d'ippolito, group head of international sales at uk-based social video advertising company unruly media, told cnn. ""the fact that there is this guy who is quite an eccentric individual -- everything from his name, his dress sense, his pink driver -- certainly sets him apart from the crowd. ""it's great because much like snooker, golf desperately needs that attention from a younger audience. and social media is an effective way of getting it. every sport should have its personality, and football has been very good at that. i think bubba is golf's answer to that personality."" there's no denying bubba's intriguing character. the devout christian tweeted ""to god be the glory!"" in response to his masters win and bawled on his mother's shoulder after hitting an astonishing shot from the woods onto the green to take the title. watson, who with wife angie adopted a son, caleb, two weeks ago, also boasts of never having a golf lesson. last year he left more people scratching their heads when he and fellow pga tour players ben crane, rickie fowler and hunter mahan launched boy band golf boys. kitted out in nothing but a pair of overalls, watson recorded the song ""oh oh oh"" to help raise money for charity. but it's bubba's dedication to social media which has given fans a special insight into his unconventional life. incredibly, he replies to every single tweet, which no doubt helped to swell his legion of followers from 306,000 after his win on sunday to more than 460,000 less than a day later. his facebook page features albums of family vacations and home videos from fans' children practicing their best bubba-style shots. watson is quick to comment on every post from the public. ""he's very engaged with social media. his music video had four million views and all these things help make bubba a likeable character,"" d'ippolito said. ""they give him mass appeal, not like the seriousness you have with a traditional golfer."" it also helps raise his profile among sponsors. though as d'ippolito admitted: ""on the flipside, it does potentially make things difficult if things go wrong, as we saw with tiger's romantic profile recently. five years ago it was inconceivable that a sporting personality would have an entire global audience at his fingertips. it opens up a whole new debate on how much sponsors can control their stars. ""it could work both ways -- some sponsors might be put off by his level of eccentricity.""",masters champ bubba watson's wacky youtube videos are internet sensation

"-- investigators were searching for bodies in a mangled wreck saturday, a day after two trains crashed and killed at least 98 people in eastern india, officials said. maoist rebels are suspected of causing the crash by removing the fasteners securing the tracks, police said. authorities identified some suspects, but had not yet made any arrests, said bhupinder singh, police chief in west bengal state. he said ""quite a few"" people were involved. at least 115 passengers were injured when 13 cars of the mumbai-bound lokmanya tilak gyaneshwari express derailed, capsized on a parallel track and were slammed by a cargo train, authorities said. more than a dozen bodies may still be trapped inside the wreckage, said n.s. nigam, west midnapore district magistrate. singh told reporters friday that officers had found maoist posters claiming responsibility for the attack. ""it appears to be a case of sabotage where a portion of the railway track was removed. whether explosives were used is not yet clear,"" indian home minister p. chidambaram said in a statement friday. manoj verma, the district police superintendent, said friday that investigators were looking into the possibility that ""fishplates,"" which secure rail joints, were missing from the track. the role of maoists ""cannot be ruled out,"" verma said. india regards maoists as its gravest internal security threat. more than 70 officers were killed in a suspected maoist ambush in chhattisgarh state last month in what was seen as one of the most daring attacks by the left-wing guerrillas on indian security forces. the insurgents, on the other hand, have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed. in february, chidambaram said that more than 900 people, including almost 600 civilians, were killed in maoist-related incidents in 2009. about 200 suspected rebels were also slain as forces moved into areas under insurgent control, he said.",at least 98 people killed after passenger train jumps track and slams into freight train

"-- a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction monday temporarily blocking key provisions of a new georgia law that aims to crack down on illegal immigration, while allowing other parts of the law to move forward. most of the law, known as hb 87, was scheduled to go into effect friday. u.s. district judge thomas thrash jr.'s ruling blocks enforcement of two of the most controversial sections of the law. ""state and local law enforcement officers and officials have no authorization to arrest, detain or prosecute anyone based upon sections 7 and 8 of hb 87 while this injunction remains in effect,"" thrash ruled. those sections would allow police to inquire about immigration status when questioning suspects in certain criminal investigations. they also would punish people who, during the commission of a crime, knowingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants. something like speeding or driving without proper equipment could constitute a crime. ""the apparent legislative intent is to create such a climate of hostility, fear, mistrust and insecurity that all illegal aliens will leave georgia,"" thrash wrote. in his 45-page ruling, the judge cited a previous court decision that said preliminary injunctions were in the public interest ""when civil rights are at stake."" he also wrote that state officials were attempting to overstep federal authority on immigration enforcement. ""i'm very happy, as are all those who believe the constitution is important,"" said charles kuck, an atlanta attorney whose firm represented some of the plaintiffs. he said the stayed provisions were poorly written and that it was unclear how they would have been enforced, if allowed to move forward. although the ruling was hailed as a victory by the plaintiffs, thrash also tossed out a number of their arguments at the state's request, a point stressed by georgia attorney general sam olens soon after the decision. ""i appreciate the speed with which judge thrash ruled, given the complexity of the issues. i am pleased with the dismissal of the 4th amendment, 14th amendment, 'right to travel,' and georgia constitutional claims by the plaintiffs -- even after this ruling, 21 of the 23 sections of hb 87 will go into effect as planned,"" olens wrote in a statement. a part of the law that will still go into effect is a provision that workers convicted of using fake identification to get jobs could be sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $250,000. the law will also require people applying for public benefits to provide certain types of identification. olens said his office will appeal the judge's ruling regarding sections 7 and 8. the office of georgia gov. nathan deal, which supports the law, also weighed in on the judge's ruling. ""beyond refusing to help with our state's illegal immigration problem, the federal government is determined to be an obstacle. the state of georgia narrowly tailored its immigration law to conform with existing federal law and court rulings,"" said brian robinson, the governor's deputy chief of staff for communications. ""georgians can rest assured that this battle doesn't end here."" the georgia lawsuit is the latest battle in a nationwide skirmish between state and federal officials over who controls immigration enforcement. arizona's controversial law aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration catapulted the issue onto the national stage last year, drawing a lawsuit from the u.s. department of justice, which argues the law is unconstitutional. in april, a three-judge panel on the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals sided with the justice department and against arizona gov. jan brewer, who signed arizona's law last year. brewer announced last month that the state would appeal directly to the u.s. supreme court. cnn's gustavo valdes and dana ford contributed to this report.",the state law is part of the broader nationwide immigration debate
"(cnn) -- what's the best way to find great links on the web? is it algorithmic search engines like google, people-powered decision-making, or a combination of both? this has been the perennial question online ever since yahoo's human-organized directory of web links lost the battle to google's automated crawlers. and yet now, in some circles at least, the pendulum appears to be swinging back: google is broken, say some technologists, and people-power is the best fix. what's the problem with google search? spam, say the critics. or rather, a new genre of not-quite-spam. so-called ""content farms"" have sprung up to produce thousands of articles per day with titles that match popular search terms -- dig in to the content however, and you'll find it anything but useful. this google-fatigue began as early as december 2009, when venture capitalist paul kedrosky remarked that using google to search for a new dishwasher delivered nothing but spam results. ""info-krill"", kedrosky called it, ""identify some words that show up in profitable searches -- from appliances, to mesothelioma suits, to kayak lessons -- churn out content cheaply and regularly, and you're done."" it's a concept that was revisited this month by prominent british blogger alan patrick, who remarked: ""this year it really hit home just how badly google's systems have been spammed, as typically anything on page 1 of the search results was some form of seo spam"". others have come to the same conclusion. prominent software developer jeff atwood this month declared ""trouble in the house of google"", while entrepreneur vivek wadhwa outlined his reasons ""why we desperately need a new (and better) google"", namely ""spammers and marketers"". developer marco arment, meanwhile, decried the ""apparent explosion recently of cheap-'content' sites"", which have contributed to ""google's apparent defeat by spam."" while the problem is clear, do technologists agree on the solution? it appears they do. atwood asks: ""are we seeing the first signs that algorithmic search has failed as a strategy? is the next generation of search destined to be less algorithmic and more social?"" kedrosky too proposes a human-powered solution, declaring that ""curation is the new search."" wadhwa, meanwhile, points to new search engine contender blekko, which searches within sets of websites defined by human editors. and arment proposes a combined approach: ""one solution may be for google to radically change their algorithms and policies for web search to de-emphasize phrase-matching and more strongly prioritize inbound links and credibility. and, in what's probably a huge departure for them, have human employees use their opinions of site quality to manually adjust the relevance of domains."" while i'm inclined to agree that human-powered decision-making may increase the quality of search results, it's worth noting that the path to ""curation"" is littered with bodies. in december 2010, news leaked that yahoo was looking to close down the social-bookmarking site delicious. yahoo later clarified that the company was instead looking to sell the service, which had pioneered wide-scale, people-powered categorization of web links. yahoo's attempts to jettison the site are hardly a shining example of the rise of human curation. last year also saw the downfall of another web 2.0 pioneer -- digg.com, which enables users to vote on web links and ranks the most popular results, saw its web traffic plummet after a redesign that aimed to keep pace with twitter and facebook. it's there, i think, where we might finally see curation bloom: on twitter and facebook, where users share millions of links per day without even the mildest sense that they're ""curators"" of the web. to these everyday internet users, they're just sharing cool websites with friends; to those who seek to make sense of an increasingly complex web, these millions of social signals are gold dust. the solutions will come in many forms, from bing's integration of facebook ""likes"" into its search results to twitter- and facebook-powered newspapers like paper.li and the twitter tim.es. but ultimately, and with a few stumbles, we'll find numerous ways to combine human judgment with the efficiency of algorithms.","google is broken, say some technologists, and people-power is the best fix"
"-- a day after police arrested five people in what authorities described as an anti-semitic demonstration that turned violent, jews expressed concern monday over the attack. supporters of those who attacked a celebration of israel's founding outside an argentine court the attack occurred outside the israeli embassy as members of argentina's jewish community, celebrating the 61st anniversary of the state of israel's founding, were confronted by a gang of youths. ""they came equipped for that,"" said daniel gazit, israel's ambassador to argentina, who witnessed the incident in which three jews and a policeman were injured -- none seriously. ""they came with their clubs, with their arms, one had a knife, one had a pistol -- they came ready for this,"" gazit said. ""it was not a political demonstration ... this was violence for the sake of violence."" witnesses said the attackers were between the ages of 15 and 20. the five who were detained were to make their first court appearance on tuesday. some people complained about the lack of security measures in place at the time of the pro-israel demonstration and denounced the secretary general of amia, a jewish community center in buenos aires, for having allowed a type of ""liberated zone"" from which the group attacked. ""there were a lot of police in that place,"" said anibal fernandez, the minister of justice. ""some uniformed, others not, and that allowed them to rapidly arrest five of them."" fernandez described the act as anti-semitic, but denied argentina was experiencing a surge in such sentiment. he blamed a small group for the incident. but for some people in argentina's jewish community, this and other recent acts, like the appearance of swastikas painted in a cemetery, have raised concerns. the israeli government, through the chancellery, demanded that the incident be investigated and that those responsible be severely punished to avoid a recurrence of such acts.","attack occurs outside the israeli embassy; four hurt, none seriously"

"-- japan has slipped to the world's third largest economy, falling behind the blistering speed of china's manufacturing growth, according to japanese figures released monday. japan's cabinet office released its nominal gross domestic product figures for 2010. japan's economy was valued at us $5.4742 trillion dollars while china was at us $5.8786 trillion. japan's economy did grow in 2010, but only 3.9%, according to the government. china's is expected to grow more than 10%. at the speed china is growing, japan's government predicts china will overtake the united states as the world's largest economy in less than 20 years. china has expanded domestic industries and infrastructure, driven by a surge in exports. multinational corporations have expanded in china, taking advantage of low labor costs. japan, meanwhile, has been stuck in stagnation and deflation for two decades. decisive economic policy has been lost in the revolving door of the country's top leader, with japan seeing six prime ministers in just five years. looking ahead, japan is facing a demographic tsunami, with the world's fastest aging population and one of the globe's lowest birth rates. on the national debt issue, japan's parliament is struggling to cap its gdp-to-debt ratio, which is nearing 200% -- the world's highest among developed nations. the size of an economy does not tell the entire picture: japan's gdp per head is around $40,000 while china's is $4,500. the standards of living remain remarkably different in the two countries. but the economic size of a country gives a snapshot of not just the financial influence of a nation, but its power in the world's political sphere.","japan's economy is now third in the world, with china moving into second place"
"-- i am proud to be english. i am also proud to be british. in fact i define myself as a british european. this means i am happy to support england in football matches, support team gb at the olympic games and support europe in the ryder cup golf tournament. when you write this all down, it looks a little complicated, but in practice millions of people do this every year in the uk with no problem -- some supporting in the way i do, some supporting scotland, others wales, and so on. i love the vibrant, tolerant, diverse, confident, nation that the uk now is. in so many places i travel to in the world, people are struggling to find a way of working together, but we've developed this character and human skill over three centuries in our united kingdom: it is a precious thing and worth standing up for. with just days to go, on september 18, scotland will vote on whether it wants to stay in the united kingdom family or leave to form a separate country. it's a huge decision, especially for those in scotland but also for everyone in the rest of the uk. whatever the result of the referendum, it will have a resounding impact on all of us -- how we see ourselves, our culture and our future. i feel it would be for more positive for scotland to remain an important and integral part of the uk and i wanted to say so publicly. that's why i am happy to support the ""let's stay together"" campaign to say to everyone in scotland just how much we do appreciate them being part of the uk family. the campaign brings together a wide and diverse group of people from all walks of life -- both famous and not -- to show scotland just how much we do care. the uk would feel a deep sense of loss if scotland left great britain. you could ask, why should an english person have any views on this? well as a member of the united kingdom, i feel i have the viewpoint of a fellow uk family member. also, i have performed in most major towns and cities across scotland and i ran eight marathons through scotland holding the saltire, the flag of scotland. and it's not just me. there are millions of people in the united kingdom who feel like this, who care about scotland and want it to remain within the union, but whose voices haven't been heard. of course, i fundamentally believe in the right of those in scotland to determine their own future and will fully respect the decision, whichever way the vote goes. but it's also true that everyone else in the uk will also find big changes in their lives, and i think it's important that we think about our combined goals and future. to my thinking, scotland can have the best of both worlds: it can have its own parliament, its own strong voice and its own cultural identity. and at the same time it can also have the strength, the security and the stability of being within the uk. at the 2012 olympics, the whole of the great britain team was fighting so hard to win medals and had such a positive spirit. it was beautiful. if scotland leaves, we'll never have that again. there are very strong economic reasons for staying together, but there is something even deeper that binds england and scotland. it's like a beautiful and long-lasting relationship. we've overcome a lot to get where we are, we do care about each other despite our tiffs, and i believe the future is much better with us working together. we do amazing things when we're together and i ask anyone who feels the same to visit letsstaytogether.org.uk. watch: brian cox and rory stewart debate independence read more: actor brian cox on why scots should vote 'yes' read more: scottish independence - what you need to know",voters in scotland to decide on country's independence on september 18

"-- a suspect has been arrested in the slaying of a 19-year-old puerto rican man found friday decapitated, dismembered and partially burned, police said tuesday. members of the u.s. gay community are asking authorities to investigate whether the slaying was a hate crime because the victim, jorge steven lopez mercado, was gay, said pedro julio serrano of the national gay and lesbian task force. ""the brutality of the slaying and the fact that he was openly gay leads us to believe it was very possibly a hate crime,"" serrano said. authorities are investigating whether the killing involved sex, guayama police commander hector agosto rodriguez told cnn affiliate wlii tv. guayama prosecutor jose bermudez identified the suspect as juan a. martinez, 26. police had earlier described him as a 27-year-old man from the interior puerto rican town of cayey. martinez was scheduled to attend a court hearing tuesday night at which charges would be lodged, said luis bernier, a spokesman for the guayama police district, which has jurisdiction in the case. the hearing was postponed several times throughout the day. officials were waiting for a prosecutor from a nearby district, causing the delay, bernier said. the fbi was not directly involved in the investigation monday, said fbi agent harry rodriguez of the san juan office. ""the fbi is monitoring this investigation by police in puerto rico,"" rodriguez said. ""any assistance that the police requests or requires, we would be more than happy to provide."" puerto rican authorities may ask for help with forensics or other advanced investigative tools the fbi could provide, rodriguez said. the u.s. attorney's office, in consultation with local officials and other agencies, would determine if the slaying was a hate crime, which is a federal offense. ""it's at a very preliminary stage,"" said lymarie llovet, a spokeswoman for the u.s. attorney's office in san juan, puerto rico's capital. puerto rico is a u.s. territory, which means federal agencies have jurisdiction. ""there's the potential for a federal investigation,"" rodriguez said. the suspect was arrested monday around 11:30 p.m. ast (10:30 p.m. et) at his home in the mogote de cayey neighborhood, said wilson porrata mariani, another spokesman for the guayama police district. police impounded two cars and also are investigating a home in another neighborhood, huertas del barrio beatriz de cidra. lopez mercado's body was found on puerto rico road 184 in another part of town, barrio guavate de cayey, police said. the slaying has reverberated throughout the gay and lesbian community in the united states, where supporters started a facebook page called ""justice for jorge steven lopez -- end hate crimes."" the group demands an investigation by puerto rico gov. luis fortuno and prosecution of the slaying under the federal hate crimes law. the law was enacted in 1969 to guard the rights of u.s. citizens engaged in any of six protected activities, such as voting, going to school, applying for a job or attending a public venue. last month, president obama signed into law the matthew shepard and james byrd jr. hate crimes prevention act, which extends federal protection against illegal acts motivated by a person's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. gay activist serrano said he does not believe anti-gay sentiment is any stronger in puerto rico's latin culture than anywhere else. ""that's a long-debunked myth, that our culture is more homophobic,"" serrano said. instead, he attributed any ill will toward gays to ""hate rhetoric"" by some religious and political leaders. one politician, he said, recently referred to gays as ""twisted and mentally ill."" ""that's the kind of rhetoric that incites violence against gays,"" serrano said. equality forum, an international gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights organization, asked for a federal investigation. ""equality forum calls on u.s. attorney general eric holder to have the fbi investigate,"" said former federal prosecutor malcolm lazin, the group's executive director. ""the matthew shepard amendment empowers and requires the federal government to prosecute this horrific murder."" serrano said lopez mercado was a ""very, very dear friend"" he had met through a mutual acquaintance. ""jorge was a person who you only needed one minute to fall in love with,"" serrano said. lopez mercado often volunteered for gay causes, serrano said. the teen's family is coping, considering the circumstances. ""it has been horrible, but they are very grateful that it has come to a quick resolution,"" serrano said.","new: activist attributes ill will toward gays to some religious, political leaders' ""hate rhetoric"""

""lesbian looking for federal equality before i die."" that's how ellen sturtz, the woman identified as the heckler, identified herself. apparently the first lady's husband said something about signing an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. sturtz had the nerve to ask the president to keep his word. and it's not like signing an order will rock washington's world -- as the washington post pointed out, of the ""employees of federal contractors that are in the fortune 1000, 92% are already protected by a company-wide sexual orientation nondiscrimination policy, and 58% are already protected by a gender identity nondiscrimination policy."" still president barack obama made a promise: it's not unreasonable to expect him to keep it. especially when one out of every 16 of his ""bundlers"" -- those who organize super fund-raisers -- during the 2012 election was openly gay. the washington post says of his top 2012 bundlers, one in six was gay. and that more than 75% of voters who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender voted for him. and yet the changes obama has wrought since he was first elected often feel as if they're being handed out like doggie treats, and not championed with the same urgency that democrats showed on the campaign trail. heckling the first lady wasn't fair because she isn't responsible for policy. but the incident sent a message to those who are responsible: we are people, not pawns. but this is what happens when a bloc of voters -- be it the lgbt community, latinos, women -- surrenders its voting power to a political party as opposed to a principle. not all republicans are anti-gay, not all democrats are pro, and it's the rare politician who will do something ""bold"" that isn't politically expedient. in illinois, the house of representatives, controlled 71-47 by democrats, chose not to vote on same-sex marriage legislation, with some members saying they needed to talk it over with their constituents. a rationale that doesn't hold much water because the senate passed the bill 34-21 in february. state sen. jason barickman, a republican, voted in support of same-sex marriage after adding a religious liberty amendment to the bill. many activists are pointing fingers at the illinois house legislative black caucus for not playing ball. this seems ironic, considering the first item under the subject line ""what are they fighting for?"" is civil equality. state rep. ken dunkin, chairman of the black caucus, did not return my calls. but he did tell the windy city times that it was unfair to pin the bill's failure on the caucus, adding, ""this is not the black caucus' burden."" because lord knows black folks have nothing to do with gay folks, right ken? gregory angelo, the log cabin republicans' national executive director, told me that ""if there's any lesson to learn from this is that democrats can't pass marriage equality on their own. they need republican support."" and the lgbt community would be wise to remember that. the republican party may house the most vocal, and sometimes offensive, opponents -- but that doesn't mean that all democrats are proponents or courageous enough to fight. the senate republicans in rhode island became the first legislative caucus in the country, of either party, to vote unanimously for same-sex marriage. the truth is the illinois democrats promised to bring the bill to a vote and they didn't. it's likely they are stalling to see what the u.s. supreme court decides in the two same-sex marriage cases it heard this spring. decisions are expected later this month. the illinois house has until august 31 to vote. this is a little political cover that may be smart but flies in the face of the party's national platform: ""we oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same-sex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples."" but democrats have trampled on that promise before, and fairly recently. in 2009, sen. chuck schumer of new york said he supported marriage for same-sex couples. but he recently opposed an amendment to the immigration reform bill that would have included same-sex couples because he thought it would make republicans kill the bill. the democrats on the senate judiciary committee didn't even want to vote on it. basically schumer wants same-sex couples to get married in his home state -- but if you're binational, he'll let the government deport your spouse. so the lgbt community gets tossed under the bus -- again -- as if our families are not worth voting for. as if we don't deserve a public record of which democrat is for us and which is against us. heckling mrs. obama wasn't fair to her. but taking the lgbt community for granted isn't fair to us either. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lz granderson.","first lady heckled by ""lesbian looking for federal equality before i die"""
"(cnn)every day, images of war and conflict are splashed across our desktops, plastered on our tv screens and scattered through our mobile news feeds. because of that, one's response to such imagery often becomes calloused or desensitized. this concept of ""how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets,"" was what drove photographer simon brann thorpe to begin his project ""toy soldiers."" this idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of western sahara, a long-disputed region of northwestern africa. thorpe uses the area's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with. the soldiers are with the polisario front, an independence movement that has been clashing with morocco over the region since the mid-1970s. thorpe said his project enables ""the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional, physical and political response to war and conflict, when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers."" thorpe's background was not in photojournalism, but in landscape photography, which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between morocco and the polisario front. ""the conflict in western sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there,"" thorpe said. after a ceasefire in 1991, the people of western sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution. the people are split into two camps -- those living in moroccan-occupied territory, and those in refugee camps in algeria. social media follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography. thorpe had to get clearance to work with the polisario front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the united nations. he usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time. the autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun. thorpe would work with the troops' commander to position the men, then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images. they would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars. not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project, but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on. thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums. after the elaborate five-week production, thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on ""how images of war (will) be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them."" simon brann thorpe's ""toy soldiers"" book is available for pre-order through dewi lewis publishing. you can follow thorpe on twitter, instagram and facebook.",simon brann thorpe's project makes real-life soldiers resemble toy soldiers
"syria's conflict erupted in march 2011 when president bashar al-assad's alawite minority-dominated government launched a crackdown against a predominantly sunni protest movement that grew into an uprising with an armed resistance. one year later, what is the situation, and what may happen next? how did the unrest start? the spark began in the southern syrian city of daraa with the arrests of at least 15 children for painting anti-government graffiti. outrage over the arrests and the government's humiliating and violent reactions to their complaints emboldened the opposition and helped it spread. by mid-march protests were occurring across syria. how syria's unrest unfolded the government launched a full-scale siege on daraa april 25, with other towns, including homs -- the country's third-largest city -- following. mass arrests unfolded and tales of torture spread across the country. the protest movement grew and solidified. paul salem, director of the carnegie middle east center, believes ""it's conceivable that if the events didn't happen in daraa,"" the uprising ""might not have occurred."" but the deep-seated political and economic reasons underlining syrian discontent was an omen. protest in syria was ""going to happen"" at some point, salem said. initially, protesters wanted basic reforms, more freedoms, a multi-party political system and an end to emergency law. the regime introduced some reforms, but they were too little, too late. protesters now want the al-assad regime out and true democratic elections. al-assad has been in power since 2000; his father, hafez, ruled syria for three decades. read bashar al-assad: president defined by violence what is happening now? the 12-month-old conflict shows no sign of abating. more than 8,000 people have now been killed, including many women and children, the u.n. said this month. opposition activists put the toll at more than 9,000. thousands more have been arrested or have disappeared, while about 30,000 syrians have fled to neighboring countries. cnn cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. but reports from inside syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-assad's ouster. al-assad's regime routinely insists ""armed terrorist groups"" are behind the bloodshed in syria. and the rebels' tactics seem to be changing too. videos show that jihad appears to have come to syria with attacks on government forces that closely resemble jihadist tactics that are the hallmark of al qaeda. how has al-assad survived? many analysts admit they under-estimated the syrian leader's powers of survival. ""al-assad proved us wrong on multiple grounds and is far more durable than we thought,"" fawaz gerges, professor of international relations at the london school of economics, told cnn. ""he's not only weathered the offensive and absorbed the shocks, but he's gone on the attack to try to crush the armed wing of the uprising."" unlike former egyptian and libyan leaders, hosni mubarak and moammar gadhafi, who were both deposed after uprisings in their countries, al-assad has adapted to the situation in his, gerges said, and is in no immediate danger. ""his security apparatus has held its ground, and there have been few defections from the top elite in the military and security services."" so the momentum the syrian rebels had during the arab spring has slowed. one reason was because of the assumption that the regime would not use the level of force it has, said chris phillips, lecturer in international relations at queen mary, university of london. ""initially al-assad had to fabricate the existence of an armed opposition in syria, but the emergence of such groups gave the regime pretext to crack down so heavily."" what external factors are in play? the syrian regime has come under international pressure to stop the crackdown -- the u.n., the united states, the european union and some members of the arab league have called for president al-assad to step down -- but so far there has been little action. many western countries have imposed sanctions, but the u.n. security council has failed to agree on a resolution calling for al-assad to go. arab and western diplomats voiced their support for a draft resolution calling for a halt to the crackdown, but representatives from russia and china vetoed it in october. russia -- which, like china, is one of the five veto-wielding permanent members of the security council -- has said it is concerned about a syrian civil war and does not want al-assad ousted. it has proposed its own draft resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both al-assad and the opposition. syria's neighbors are concerned about an influx of refugees. jordan's king abdullah called for al-assad to step down, the arab league suspended syria's membership, and turkey, one of syria's largest trading partners, imposed sanctions and threatened to cut off syria's electricity. but crucially iran's shiite leadership remains loyal to al-assad, who is an alawite, an offshoot of shia islam that is in a minority in syria. ""syria is caught in the middle of a regional crisis,"" said gerges. ""on the one hand there's iran and on the other, saudi arabia and the gulf countries. one must also never under-estimate the lengths that russia will go to in standing behind the regime."" with videos posted on social media providing much impetus for the uprising, tehran's help is vital, analysts say. ""iran is now supplying crucial intelligence on rebels who are posting youtube videos as well as finance,"" said phillips. ""russia and china are also providing diplomatic cover -- so we can see how al-assad has deftly repositioned his international alliances to stay in power."" is there any prospect of military intervention? last year, the u.n. security council voted to impose a no-fly zone in libya and use ""all necessary measures"" to protect its people from moammar gadhafi. but there is no such appetite for similar action against syria. ""the chinese and russians are dead set against (intervention),"" said cnn's fareed zakaria in a recent blog post. ""so it couldn't happen through the united nations. there would be effectively a kind of unilateral or nato operation with no international legitimacy."" and while there are calls for robust military intervention, that could be the worst possible thing to do, according to rami khouri, who runs the international affairs program at the american university in beirut. ""i think foreign military intervention would probably be catastrophic, and to hear americans suggest this is to think back what they did in iraq and what an extraordinary catastrophe that has been,"" khouri said on ""fareed zakaria gps."" experts point out that while the opposition groups in libya were relatively united and organized, the same cannot be said for rebels in syria. al-assad also continues to hold a vice-like grip on the country's security apparatus, and has the support of the army, one that is much stronger, better equipped and more unified than the one in libya. geography must also be taken into account when considering intervention in syria. libya was relatively easy last year: most targets were near the mediterranean coast and nato air bases in italy. but syria has a much smaller coastline than libya (roughly 119 miles vs. 1,110 miles), and neighboring countries probably won't be so accommodating for supplies, troops or anything else needed in a possible mission. is the opposition united? weapons are flowing in, refugees are fleeing, but there seems little in the way of an organized syrian opposition with which to work. and while sunni muslim neighbors such as saudi arabia and qatar want al-assad's removal, this seems more of an opportunistic anti-iran strategy. among the resistance forces are apparently some radical sunni fighters, perhaps al qaeda itself, and others whose ascension to power would likely cause a further crisis, with millions of christians and other religious minorities fleeing from the region. the failure of opposition groups to unite is the main reason the uprising has stalled, analysts say. ""if i was the opposition, i'd look to the longer term,"" said gerges. ""they've presented a narrative to the outside world that al-assad's days are numbered. they've spent time trying to get military intervention but not enough on unifying themselves into a cohesive group. they believe they're going to win in the end but at the moment they're divided both in and outside syria."" the opposition has failed so far to win the support of wider sections of syrian society, most observers believe. ""the rebels haven't proved a credible force either politically or militarily,"" said phillips. ""the regime is easily a match for them on the battlefield, but crucially the sunni merchant classes in cities like aleppo have remained neutral."" what might happen next? the conflict is likely to continue with neither side able to deliver a knockout blow. analysts believe al-assad is secure in the short-term with regional backing from iran and wider diplomatic cover from russia and china. but even if it defeats the opposition, phillips said it is unclear how the regime can repackage itself. ""it's very difficult to see how the opposition is going to topple al-assad, but one must ask if he has alienated his core constituents so much that he cannot rule by consent?"" he asked. and the longer the conflict continues, the more fundamentalist islamist elements will get involved, analysts say. ""if it goes on some syrians will turn to jihadi-style tactics,"" said gerges. ""i wouldn't be surprised if it eventually goes the way of iraq although it's important to stress that the bulk of the armed response now is local syrian, not al qaeda."" in a recent blog posting, fareed zakaria pointed out that al-assad drew an unfortunate lesson from the arab spring: ""don't waiver; don't make concessions; don't show weakness. in al-assad's eyes, egypt's hosni mubarak vacillated in his response to protests and ended up in prison. libya's moammar gadhafi wasn't ruthless enough and ended up dead. al-assad has chosen to be brutal."" however he said in the longer term al-assad's position is weak. for this reason, zakaria said: ""the government will not be able to fully suppress this revolt. the opposition will prove unable to completely overturn the government. the stalemate could go on for a long, long time.""","protests across syria began on march 15, 2011 after children's arrest for graffiti"
"russia has failed to take steps to end the ukraine conflict, president barack obama said wednesday in announcing expanded sanctions targeting two banks, two energy companies, ukraine separatists and defense companies. european union leaders also said they intended to increase sanctions, signaling growing western concern over russia's continued support for separatists battling the ukrainian military in the country's eastern region. ""we have to see concrete actions, and not just words that russia in fact is committed to trying to end this conflict along the russia-ukraine border,"" obama told reporters at the white house. with the new sanctions, ""what we are expecting is that the russian leadership will see once again that its actions in ukraine have consequences, including a weakening economy, and increasing diplomatic isolation,"" the president said. his russian counterpart, vladimir putin, warned that the sanctions were harming ties between the two nations. ""they generally have a boomerang effect and, without a doubt, in this case, are driving the russian-u.s. relations into a stalemate and seriously damaging them,"" he said, according to a kremlin transcript of his remarks to reporters on a visit to brazil. ""i am certain that this is harmful to the u.s. administration and american people's long-term strategic national interests."" he accused the united states of pushing the ukrainian authorities toward a continued conflict, whereas russia wants to see an immediate end to hostilities and a negotiated solution involving all sides, he said. ukrainian president: peace depends on putin's mood the latest u.s. sanctions build on earlier steps by targeting two major russian banks -- gazprom bank and veb -- and two energy companies -- novotek and rosneft. they will not be able to get new medium- and long-term financing in the united states, senior administration officials told reporters in a conference call. in addition, the new sanctions freeze any u.s. assets and prohibit american business contacts for eight russian arms companies that make weapons, including small arms, mortars and surface-to-air missiles. one of the eight is the kalashnikov concern, maker of the ak-47 and other arms. also on the list: four russian government officials, including the minister of crimean affairs, along with the self-styled luhansk people's republic and donetsk people's republic leading the separatist campaign in eastern ukraine, and aleksandr borodai, the self-declared ""prime minister"" of the donetsk group. targeting the separatist groups that simulate government structures prevents them from seeking financing, the senior administration officials noted. earlier this year, the united states and europe imposed a range of sanctions in response to russia's annexation of crimea this spring and massing of troops along its eastern border with ukraine. the earlier sanctions included asset freezes and travel bans. 19 ukrainian troops killed in rocket attack, military says russia and ukraine have since been engaged in a tense standoff, including clashes between pro-russian separatists and ukrainian forces in the donetsk and luhansk regions. ""i've repeatedly made it clear that russia must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border into ukraine, that russia must urge separatists to release their hostages and support a cease-fire, that russia needs to pursue internationally-mediated talks, and agree to meaningful monitors on the border,"" obama said. russia has failed to do any of those steps, he added. ukraine's government in kiev has accused russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-russian separatists. the senior administration officials who briefed reporters also leveled the same accusation. meanwhile, the pentagon said on wednesday russia now had 12,000 troops on the border with ukraine, as well as some heavy weapons. the troop numbers had fallen to about 1,000 previously from a high of an estimated 40,000 forces earlier this year. fast facts: ukraine",vladimir putin says u.s. sanctions are pushing russia-u.s. relations into a stalemate
"-- critical water pipelines are breaking from coast to coast, triggered by this summer's record high temperatures. it's not a phenomenon or coincidence, experts say. it's a clear sign that americans should brace for more water interruptions, accompanied by skyrocketing water bills. the heat wave of the past few weeks has burst hundreds of crucial pipes in california, kansas, oklahoma, texas, indiana, kentucky and new york, temporarily shutting off water to countless consumers just when they needed it most. ""it's one of the worst summers,"" said debbie ragan of oklahoma city's utilities department. as days of 100 degree-plus temperatures bake the region, the utility reports 685 water main breaks since july alone. that's an estimated rate of four times normal. to keep up with repairs, ragan said, workers have been putting in 12-to 16-hour shifts 24/7. ""it's the heat and the high water usage,"" ragan said. high temperatures can dry soil so that it shrinks away from buried pipes. increased water usage raises pressure inside the water lines. both factors add strain to pipeline walls, making older pipes more susceptible to bursting. it underscores the fact that much of the nation's underground water lines are 80 to 100 years old -- and approaching the end of their lives. experts call it america's ""replacement era,"" when hundreds of water utilities nationwide will be forced to replace their aging infrastructure -- or suffer the consequences. who will probably have to pay for those hundreds of thousands of miles of new pipelines? utility customers, industry experts say. water rates ranked for 50 cities for towns like kemp, texas, population 1,150, the situation reached emergency levels this week. a historic drought throughout texas has left kemp with what mayor donald kile described as ""cracks so big in the ground, you could lose a small dog in them."" fourteen major water line breaks august 7 emptied water towers and forced kemp to shut off water service until tuesday, officials said. the mayor blamed the crisis on 80-year-old pipelines and high demand as temperatures rose above 100 degrees for 37 straight days. texas town turns off water, leaving residents boiling mad it's even worse in the texas town of robert lee. the hellish heat has left its entire reservoir dry as a bone. community leaders are considering trucking water in from elsewhere or laying a 12-mile pipeline to connect to water in a nearby town. get ready for more of the same, environmentalists say. shifting climate change in the coming decades, they warn, will probably bring more droughts, record high temperatures and other weather conditions that will damage water infrastructure. texas town threatened by dried-out reservoir options to ensure water for small towns like these are few and expensive, ranging from building larger reservoirs to connecting their water systems to utilities in nearby areas. ""that kind of interconnection might be life-saving for that community,"" said tom curtis of the american water works association. but the expense of laying miles of pipe may be too much for many utilities to handle. town turns sewer water into drinking water three facts hammer home the scary status of the nation's water infrastructure: • the nation averages about 700 water main breaks nationwide each day, according to the epa. • u.s. water utilities lose an average of about 10% of their water -- worth $2.8 billion per year -- through leaks and other causes, according the epa. • the american society of civil engineers grades the water infrastructure at a d minus. ""we've gotten so good at capturing and transporting water that we've really started to take it for granted,"" said alex prud'homme, author of ""the ripple effect,"" about the nation's declining water infrastructure. ""we had better start looking ahead and repairing our water infrastructure, because with the pressure from climate change, population growth, shifting demographics and the way we use water, the problem is only going to get worse rather than better."" skyrocketing water bills mystify, anger residents searching for answers with technology inside a control room in the nation's capital, not far from the potomac river, experts are hoping technology will solve this problem. the room is filled with multiple monitors displaying brightly colored graphs. ""it looks like we should be launching rockets into space,"" said george hawkins, general manager of washington, d.c.'s water and sewer authority. the room helps stand guard over the city's 13,000 miles of water pipes and 42,000 valves. strategically placed sensors detect leaks ranging from a trickle to full-blown water main bursts. data about the breach are sent from these sensors to the control room, and technicians respond immediately. this allows the utility to more quickly and easily identify aging pipes and valves before they blow. ""the highest cost we face is digging up the street on an emergency basis any time of day or night -- often overtime,"" hawkins said. the cost of replacing these aging systems is stunning. hawkins recalls a major water main break last year along the national mall that flooded parts of buildings housing the internal revenue service and justice department. the burst pipe buckled constitution avenue by about a foot and cost almost $1 million in repairs and restoration. smart water meters have slashed monthly meter readings from $3 per customer to just pennies. when these meters show a spike in customer's water use, the utility sends an e-mail to alert customers that they may have a leak. the technology is credited with cutting water leaks from 36 percent to 22 percent, saving customers even more. ""quadruple hit"" the replacement era is going to be expensive. the epa estimated that between 2007 and 2027, drinking water utilities will have to invest $334 billion on new infrastructure. the problem is worsened by the timing of it all. there's budget-cutting talk at the local, state and federal level. hawkins called it a ""quadruple hit."" ""i don't see that there's any way, other than rate increases for most cities given the size of the financial need,"" hawkins said. ""if we're not able in parallel to demonstrate how we're efficiently using the dollars we're collecting, i think this industry is in for huge challenges with our customers."" water officials in pittsburgh are considering raising rates more than 13% for infrastructure improvements. in cleveland, authorities increased water fees for the same reason. leaders in baltimore took similar action. ""with this increase, we can either stop drinking water, stop showering, stop doing the laundry or get out of the city,"" complained a reader on cnn affiliate wbal's website. ""the mayor and city council need to realize that we along with other homeowners are the tax base, and if we leave, they're up the creek!"" in southern california, los angeles water officials are thinking about raising rates to replace thousands of miles of decaying water pipes. the city of indianapolis is trying something different. hoping to save yearly operating costs by combining utilities, the city shifted control of its water and sewer system to a not-for-profit trust that also runs the local natural gas. it will free up $425 million in city funds that could be used for other expenses. ""taxpayers have been unwilling to look at the long-term,"" prud'homme said. ""but taxes and water rates go to maintaining this very important infrastructure that we take for granted, and if you're not willing to pay those fees and taxes, then you'll eventually suffer the consequences."" national water dialogue those consequences, some warn, include shifting weather patterns due to global climate change. hotter summers and fluctuating water levels in lakes and oceans due to climate change will damage water and sewer systems in the coming decades, according to a new report from the natural resources defense council. ""i'm not hearing any outrage,"" prud'homme said. ""i kind of feel like the crazy person on the roof yelling and shouting and saying, 'hey, everybody we've got to wake up and pay attention to this,' especially when it comes to our dams and levees."" in a year that has seen historic flooding in several midwestern and southern states along the ohio and mississippi rivers, prud'homme says, he thought the levee failures during hurricane katrina would have prompted more alarm about flood defenses. ""more than 100 levees are at risk of catastrophic failure,"" he said. ""and this is from the u.s. army corps of engineers."" prud'homme fears that u.s. water issues are so threatening, sweeping policy changes are needed. he's calling for a national dialogue focusing on water infrastructure issues. ""we have no single federal office that's overseeing the nation's water supply,"" prud'homme said. ""there aren't really any easy answers to this, but these are issues that we have to tackle.""",heat wave blamed for water pipeline bursts from california to new york
"syria's prime minister defected monday, becoming the latest among high-profile politicians and leaders to leave the embattled regime of bashar al-assad. ""i announce today my defection from the killing and terrorist regime and i announce that i have joined the ranks of the freedom and dignity revolution. i announce that i am from today a soldier in this blessed revolution,"" riyad hijab said in a written statement read by a syrian opposition official on al jazeera. cnn inside syria analysts described hijab's departure as a significant symbolic blow for al-assad's government but noted that the former prime minister had been on the job for only a few months. al-assad appointed hijab prime minister in june, a month after parliamentary elections that were boycotted by supporters of those seeking to oust al-assad. ""in short, this isn't going to bring a lot of insight into what assad is thinking or doing. it is certainly embarrassing and does some damage to regime,"" said david hartwell, a senior analyst of islamic affairs at jane's. ""but all indications are that hijab was probably kept in the dark. this wasn't a man who had assad's ear. assad appointed him just a few months ago. he was essentially just another cabinet member without much power at all."" hijab was tasked with creating a new cabinet for al-assad's regime. opposition leaders said hijab had defected, while syrian state television said al-assad dismissed hijab from his post monday. syrian information minister omran al-zoubi said officials hadn't ""heard anything from the former prime minister,"" according to the state-run syrian arab news agency the information minister also ""said that fleeing and leaving one's post in an illegitimate manner is an evasion of responsibility and shows lack of political and national awareness,"" the news agency reported. in july, one of syria's most senior diplomats -- nawaf al-fares -- defected, publicly embraced his country's uprising and called for a foreign military intervention. al-fares was syria's ambassador to iraq. manaf tlas, a sunni general in syria's elite republican guards, also defected last month. tlas is the son of a former defense minister and a cousin of a first lieutenant in al-assad's army. also monday, the turkish news agency anadolu reported that syria's first man in space -- astronaut mohammad ahmad faris, who flew on a 1987 soviet space mission -- crossed into turkey last weekend and proclaimed his support for opposition forces. hijab, like al-fares and tlas, is a sunni who served in a power structure dominated by the alawite minority, an offshoot of shiism.

""the flooding was so fast that the thing flipped over,"" coast guard capt. william diehl told cnn. the sailboat, named cynthia woods, was one of about two dozen boats heading from galveston, texas, to veracruz, mexico, for the annual veracruz regatta race, which began on friday. diehl said the boat was well-stocked with safety equipment -- including emergency radio beacons, life rafts and ring buoys -- but the crew could only manage to find four life jackets after the boat tipped over. ""the survivors told us that [when] they went into the water, they had four life jackets among the five, and they huddled together and they exchanged the life jackets among them so that they could stay afloat,"" diehl said. communication with the boat was lost about midnight friday, and the boat missed its 8 a.m. radio check the next morning, the coast guard reported. a sailboat matching the description of the missing 38-foot boat was found overturned about 5:15 p.m. saturday, authorities said. the five survivors were found several hours later about 23 miles south of freeport, texas, according to the coast guard's press release. they were lifted to safety by a u.s. coast guard helicopter around 2 a.m. local time and taken to university of texas medical branch in galveston for treatment. the search for the missing crew member involved two coast guard helicopters, a falcon jet, a marine corps c-130 -- which has night-vision capabilities -- and the coast guard cutter manowar. all of those on board the capsized sailboat were experienced sailors, diehl said.

"-- baseball. the radio. summer. there is something about the connection between the three of them that nothing can tear apart. if baseball on the radio sounds a little different lately, there is a reason. richard sandomir of the new york times reported recently on the proliferation of ""drop-in"" advertisements on radio broadcasts of ballgames around the nation. drop-in ads are paid commercials that air not as traditional advertisements, but as part of the play-by-play. the first walk during a new york yankees game is accompanied by ""just walk into citymd's six convenient locations""; the first run scored in a texas rangers game is described by the play-by-play man as ""the first financial first run."" it shouldn't be surprising that this is happening. baseball has always been a relentlessly and unapologetically revenue-seeking enterprise. have you ever seen photos of the outfield walls in big-league ballparks in the early to mid-20th century? even nascar's marketing strategists would have been envious of the don't-waste-an-inch commercial clutter. broadcast entities have to find a way to make back the money they spend for radio rights. according to usa today the average salary of a major league baseball player this year -- the average salary -- is around $3.6 million, and everything from ticket fees to concession-stand prices is reflective of the sport's runaway inflation. so no one should be startled by the presence of the drop-in radio ads. yes, they frequently can be an irritant to the flow of the play-by-play. but ours is a sponsor-and-advertising-driven culture overall; that's not going to go away. and baseball on the radio -- distinct even from baseball itself -- is durable and steady in ways that can't be easily spoiled. baseball on the radio is one part of the sport that somehow, despite everything, still manages to feel good. on the radio, baseball is less literal than baseball on television. with the measured voices of the most skilled announcers accompanied by the resonant humming undertone of the crowd, the echo from down on the diamond of the crack of a bat against a fastball, and the occasional thump of a foul ball bouncing off the top of the play-by-play booth, there is a kind of romance in a radio broadcast. the sports-page and sports-website coverage of the business of baseball may, of necessity, be dismaying and ugly lately. a visit to the ballpark in person brings on the sticker-shock of those prices on everything from hot dogs to souvenirs to parking spots. baseball on the radio, though, remains free. unlike viewers of cable tv or subscribers to satellite radio, fans of home-team games on their hometown radio stations don't have to pay a cent to listen. the sound of it all is very much what the sound has been forever. because the pace of the game is leisurely, local play-by-play announcers, over a 162-game season, develop a relationship with their listeners unique in sports. they have to talk a lot, even when there's not much going on down on the field, and the audience grows accustomed to, and comfortable with, their relaxed voices and their heard-but-not-seen personalities. and that's just during routine games. at certain moments, radio broadcasts of ballgames can become part of the very fabric of a town -- the authentication of how sports can help define the meaning of community. how good can it get? for a gold-standard example from the history of the sport and of the medium, listen to the kmox radio broadcast of stan musial's final at-bat for the st. louis cardinals before his retirement. the date was september 29, 1963, at the old busch stadium in st. louis. on the play-by-play was harry caray, in the years before he moved to chicago to broadcast the white sox and then the cubs. some older residents of st. louis recall a television simulcast of caray's call, but it is the kmox radio version that is indelible in their memories: ""here's musial. listen to the crowd again."" (the roar is heard behind caray's voice.) ""a base hit would give the cardinals the lead."" (the noise sustains.) ""first pitch. oh, what a cut he had, and he fouled it back. hey, he really had a swing at that one."" (the crowd begins to clap rhythmically in unison.) ...""the stretch by maloney. low curve."" and then, unforgettably, from caray: ""take a good look, fans. ... take a good look. this might be the last time at bat in the major leagues. remember the stance ... and the swing."" (the rhythmic clapping in the stands grows more insistent.) ""you're not likely to see his likes again."" the procession of the game: ""fast ball, low and away."" and soon: ""the pitch to musial."" (caray's voice rises to be heard above the mounting crowd noise.) ""a hot shot on the ground into right field, a base hit! ...the cardinals lead, one to nothing, listen to the crowd! listen to the crowd! let's see, now! manager johnny keane is talking to gary kolb. ""stan is at first base. he might be waiting for this applause on the hit to die down. ... they'll tear the joint apart when he trots off the field. ... now listen. gary kolb is going to replace musial. ...there he goes! the end of a great career. a standing ovation for musial. ..."" could being in the stands have been any more memorable than listening to that? i remember talking once with a woman in her 80s. she was residing in an assisted-living facility; her husband had died the year before, and the end of their lifetime of long conversations in the evenings had left a void. she told me that, even though she had never been much of a baseball fan, she found herself tuning in, each evening, to the strong-signal wlw radio out of cincinnati. for three hours, she said, she would listen to marty brennaman and joe nuxhall broadcast the reds' games. their voices -- reliable, unhurried -- became her companions. a part of life she could count on.

"-- a total of nine athletes, including olympic bronze medalist nataliya tobias, have tested positive for ""sophisticated doping"" offenses, the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) has confirmed. six of those athletes were caught using a new ""biological passport"" method, which builds up a profile of each individual over a prolonged period of time. the remaining three, including tobias who came third in the women's 1500 meters in beijing four years ago, were suspended after further analysis of samples they gave at the world championships in daegu last year.

""we will not stint in our resolve to do everything in our power to eradicate cheating."" the iaaf said they had been collecting samples from various athletes in the build up to the olympics and would conduct 200 more biological passports during the games. that method accounted for six bans, for morocco's abderrahim goumri, greece's irini kokkinariou, turkey's meryem erdogan, and three russians -- svetlana klyuka, nailiya yulamanova and yevgenina zinurova, the 2011 european indoors 800m champion. along with tobias, fellow ukrainian antonina yefremova was charged after synthetic testosterone was found in their systems, while bulgaria's inna eftimova tested positive for a synthetic growth hormone. all three athletes admitted the offense and waived their right to a ""b"" sample, meaning their four-year bans were halved. the six caught via the ""biological passport"" method were flagged as suspicious in 2009 and were found to have persistently used banned substances over a long period, the iaaf said. four of the six -- erdogan, klyuka, yulamanova and zinurova -- admitted their offense and waived their right to a ""b"" sample, meaning their original four-year bans were cut in half. the iaaf said goumri had recently received a four-year ban by the moroccan athletic federation, but was permitted to appeal as the decision had not yet been ratified by the iaaf. kokkinariou has been banned for two years by the greek athletic federation but the iaaf said they were appealing to the court of arbitration for sport to have it doubled on the grounds of ""aggravating circumstances."" it was not immediately clear whether any of the nine athletes were part of olympic teams set to participate in london 2012. hero or villain? ben johnson and the dirtiest race in history north korean women's team stage walk out in row over flag mix up the 10 strangest olympic sports",nine athletes banned for doping by the international association of athletics federations

"(cnn)most airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems. the cockpit is our ""safe"" place. the flight deck is a structured world of black and white. checklists. procedures. standardization. stress from the job is an accepted part of our career. however, sometimes during the course of an airline pilot's career, or anyone's career for that matter, stress issues may manifest as depression. depression is treatable. and for airline pilots, it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood. the federal aviation administration now approves certain prescribed medication, allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor. as the world learns more about andreas lubitz, the co-pilot on germanwings flight 9525, it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression. he reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems, an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness. but lubitz's illness didn't just appear out of thin air. its effects had to be apparent to others. lubitz's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course. considering the hoops lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a germanwings co-pilot, it's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed. to what hoops am i referring? first, let's start with his passion for gliders. glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation. although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor, the sport involves teamwork. interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety. i'm a glider pilot. participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot. behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent. second, lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of germanwings employment. the selection process is most likely highly competitive, requiring above-average aptitude. is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed? regardless, the process had to be a stressful experience. opinion: germanwings and the stigma of mental illness once accepted into the flight program, a rigorous training period began. for primary training, lufthansa utilizes an ab initio (from the beginning) program based at a facility the airline owns in goodyear, arizona, near phoenix. the training is geared toward a multi-crew pilot license, or mpl, recognized by the international civil aviation organization. the purpose of an mpl is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers. countries that don't have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license. airline pilots in the united states are not licensed in this manner, requiring as much as 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot. this is a fairly recent change in faa regulations, initiated as a result of the 2009 colgan airlines crash in buffalo, new york. lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror. as a 21-year-old flight instructor, i had that much flight time; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience. as with all of the mpl programs, the training involves an intense period of airline-specific instruction. and to add insult to injury, candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride. regardless, the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about $76,000. using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time, the student receives about 250 hours of training. it is a period of almost constant supervision. aside from observing and checking performance criteria, wouldn't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment? and wouldn't a fellow trainee have noticed also? according to reports, lubitz took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior. was that not in and of itself a red flag? wouldn't a manager in lufthansa's flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues? after all, the selection process was most likely highly competitive, with other qualified candidates readily available. once the primary training in arizona was complete, lubitz would have returned to germany and completed more specific schooling on the airbus a320 he was about to fly. again, no one observed issues. but even more curious, according to reports, lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to lufthansa. over the course of a career, an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues. even if we have never flown with a particular individual, experience allows us the intuition to know when something isn't quite right. that determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines, or perhaps through a simple conversation. in that regard, i find it difficult to believe that none of lubitz's colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time. as supplemental background, germanwings had been established as the low-cost, alter ego carrier of lufthansa. depending upon a pilot's monthly flight time, salary for pilots can be as much as 20% lower than the mainline carrier. in addition, more days on duty were part of a germanwings crew member's schedule. apparently as late as march 20, lufthansa pilots had been on strike, one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires. perhaps enough of a disparity existed for germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered lubitz's absence. regardless, all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27-year-old man. the world knows the end result. it just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen. could it have been prevented? well, this is the primary purpose of accident investigation: never allow the same tragedy to occur again.",les abend: there were likely warning signs during the co-pilot's training

""among the instances of rape reported in chad, the vast majority (10 of 11 confirmed reports) occurred when women left the camps to gather firewood."" and just over half of the 88 women interviewed -- 46 of them -- live in fear of sexual assaults around the refugee camp. the group supports the issuing of international criminal court warrants against the sudanese perpetrators. the group also called for ""legal reforms in chad to end impunity for sexual violence,"" and for ""effective psychosocial support to survivors."" and it said increased protections are needed by police and peacekeepers, including ""effective firewood patrols."" the conflict in darfur began in 2003 after rebels in the western region of sudan began attacking government positions. sudan's government responded with a fierce military campaign that has led to some 200,000 deaths and forced 2 million people to flee their homes, according to the united nations.","88 darfuri women interviewed in chad described ""profound"" suffering and fear"

"-- while the likes of roger federer and serena williams strut their stuff at wimbledon, spare a thought for the grass under their feet -- which will take a double pounding in the next two months. just 20 days after the men's final at the all england club, the tennis competition at the 2012 london olympics will begin -- and the team working on the famous courts are keeping their fingers crossed that this week's inclement weather does not cause any further delays. andy newell from the sports turf research institute (stri) gives wimbledon head groundsman eddie seaward and his staff expert scientific advice on that preparation and admits that any delay into a third week would be a serious problem. ""they don't want to lose time because they are already on such a fine edge and even a day would mean you lose 5% of your preparation, and that could be crucial,"" he told cnn. ten of wimbledon's courts will be used for the olympics and it's going to prove seaward's biggest challenge -- coming in his final year in the job, after more than two decades of involvement. preparation is the key, and the london olympic organizing committee (locog) insisted on a trial run at wimbledon after the games were awarded to the uk capital. trial run ""we worked on them just a couple of years ago to prove to locog that we could do that within a short period of time, get the courts back in pristine condition,"" seaward told cnn. but trial run or not, it's still a daunting prospect with little room for error. the grass must be cut to an exact 8 millimeters for optimum performance, and seaward and his team have to keep a wary eye on that unpredictable british weather -- ground temperature and humidity levels are constantly measured. for this reason, the expertise of scientists and agronomists is so important. stri has been advising wimbledon for over a decade. at its main testing center in a little corner of west yorkshire, in northern england, its staff have recreated their own versions of centre court -- trialing different varieties of grass to provide the best and most resilient surface. ""we can test the grasses that they may use in the future here, "" said newell, stri's head of turf grass biology. ""we can whittle them down, we can get rid of the chaff, hopefully keep the wheat for them."" best grass over the years, newell and his colleagues have come to the conclusion that perennial ryegrass provides the best surface, both in terms of wear and playing characteristics. ""in essence we've moved from one grass species which was inappropriate for wimbledon, to one which was the best for wimbledon,"" says stri chief executive gordon mckillop. the company has grown to employ up to 85 people, and wimbledon forms just part of their work. the cricket pitches at lord's, the fairways and greens of st. andrews, the home of golf, and the football turf for euro 2012 in poland and ukraine have all had their grass tried and tested at stri's research center in bingley. when the pitch at the euro 2012 game between france and the ukraine dramatically flooded, experts from stri were on hand to monitor its drying out. they had advised using a vacuum pump system when the donbass arena in donetsk was constructed, and it paid off. weather gods the team working on wimbledon and the olympics had been keeping their fingers crossed for the perfect growing conditions at sw19 in july and august. ""two weeks of wall-to-wall sunshine, not unbearably hot, with the odd contrast in conditions, perhaps a bit of rain, would make our job much easier,"" said newell. but true to form the british weather has misbehaved during the championships and the inevitable rain delays have left organizers with more than a few headaches. for newell the effect of such a varied climate on growing conditions is the bread and butter of his work. he has installed micro weather stations at wimbledon to aid his research, as well as digging a small hole on centre court to measure moisture levels. ""it's quite an important hole because it allows me to measure how much moisture there is at different depths,"" newell said. ""moisture is needed for the grass to grow, but it's also needed in the sense that we've got to dry it out to get the ball to bounce."" surprise tactic the playing characteristics of the courts at wimbledon have been the subject of debate and no little controversy over the years, with claims it now favors baseline play rather than classic serve and volley. newell said the trend was more to do with the strength of the players, their rackets and the balls that are being used, rather than the surfaces being prepared. ""players now use serve and volley as a surprise tactic rather than the norm,"" he said. during seaward's time at the all england club, he has seen that change of tactics reflected on the worn parts of his courts. ""when i first started here, the players used to serve and run in to return the ball, they used to check and stop and wear the grass out and there's a patch in the middle there. that slowly but surely moved further back every year, until it's completely disappeared,"" he said. without the likes of boris becker and pete sampras charging forward to scuff up the grass in the middle of the court, the task of the groundsman has become rather easier, particularly with the tight olympic deadline in mind. seaward and his team will begin their olympic work even while play is still taking place on the show courts. ""we know the baseline is more worn than the rest of it, but by the time you get a bit of water on it, it starts to green up a bit,"" he said. nature's way the secret is using pre-germinated, or pre-grown seed, which is sowed into the worn patches. ""we've got to try to get some grass back in there, in a very short space of time,"" seaward said. ""within a few days it will be up, hopefully, and we'll be preparing the courts."" and bearing this in mind, there is a plus side to the constant drizzle that is coming out of the cloudy skies of london in what has proved a pretty miserable summer. ""for growing grass, rain is a bonus,"" said newell, adding that water from the sky falls more evenly than that supplied by artificial sprinklers. newell believes that the soil texture underneath the grass is just as important in determining the playing characteristics, but knows that when hosting the biggest sports show on earth, aesthetics are important. ""the idea is that we get the court to look the way it's going to look on the opening monday of wimbledon."" but he warned: ""it all comes back to nature, and nature can't be rushed."" if the joint efforts of all those involved are ultimately successful, perhaps the international olympic committee could award a special gold medal to seaward and his extended team -- because working around the clock, they may well have deserved it.",wimbledon is also hosting the 2012 olympic games tennis tournament

"-- julian castro, the mayor of san antonio, and mike villarreal, the city's representative in the state legislature, saw potential in an historic, amoeba-shaped park parcel near the city's convention center. so, the two set to work. they secured the civic support, government approval and funding needed to turn hemisfair park into a place where playgrounds and mixed income housing will one day overlook a grassy span and the tower of the americas â€” an observation tower marking the park's location as the site of the 1968 world's fair. as president barack obama's choice to become the next housing secretary, a focus on helping revitalize inner-city areas, colleagues in texas say, will stand the 39-year-old mayor in good stead. ""based on his focus here in san antonio on working to improve housing in the city's core and inner city, i suspect he would advance an agenda that has in mind family and children,"" said villarreal, who is vying to replace castro as mayor. ""i think you're going to be seeing a secretary of housing who understands housing on a human level."" obama 's new pick for hud secretary if confirmed, castro would head an agency that is still reeling from fallout from the housing crisis â€” including meeting mushrooming demands for affordable rental housing. he will also be tasked with helping the financially beleaguered federal housing administration, which has been struggling to cope with a record number of home mortgage defaults. obama noted during the nomination ceremony that castro ""never forgets where he comes from."" he also highlighted castro's mention of his mexican-born grandmother in his keynote address to the democratic convention in 2012 as an immigrant who worked hard to provide a home for her family. ""for her and generations like her a home is more than just a house,"" obama said. castro will likely face questions in his confirmation hearings why san antonio did not follow federal guidelines when it spent millions in hud funds aimed at helping address the housing crisis during his tenure as mayor, according to a 2012 report by the agency's inspector general. the report found the city did not use a competitive bid process when it awarded $2.5 million for renovation contracts and that it did not follow federal affordability guidelines designed to target lower income residents when it spent just over $1 million to buy and fix up homes. a call to castro's san antonio office seeking comment about his hud nomination was not immediately returned. still, supporters feel castro has the right mix of experience to lead the agency. ""this economy has not been as robust as we would have hoped,"" henry cisneros, a former hud secretary and former san antonio mayor told cnn on friday. ""part of the reason for that has been because the housing sector has been on the sidelines. but now housing can get into the fray and, as hud secretary, castro is well-poised to do that."" cisneros, who says he has discussed housing-related issues with castro in the past and plans on having additional conversations with him, said that as mayor of san antonio, the younger man dealt with issues of poverty, homelessness and home affordability and is well suited to the task. opinion: why julian castro said yes to obama texas political consultant bill miller also feels castro is up to the challenge. ""he'll be a cool customer. he's not going to get supercharged or over wrought over anything,"" said miller who is a founding partner at hillco partners in austin, a state political consulting group. ""if there have been problems and challenges at the agency he's not going to be let's throw the baby out with the bathwater."" castro's appointment also would be a win for democrats looking to add diversity to its national roster of potential candidates and put texas in play in 2016 as well as help smooth over tensions with latinos who are frustrated over a lack of an immigration reform overhaul, said julian zelizer, a princeton university historian and cnn contributor. ""in terms of the democrats and obama, it is at least symbolic of the party's commitment to immigration and immigration reform,"" zelizer said. ""it does elevate his status. it makes him a national figure rather than a local figure."" castro, the son of political activists, is the youngest mayor of a major american city. his meteoric rise from local government to being called upon to take on a cabinet-level position is a political narrative tailor-made for primetime. he and his twin brother, rep. joaquin castro, d-texas, were picked to take the stage at the 2012 democratic national convention in charlotte. the congressman introduced his brother who in turn gave a keynote address that was memorable for both his young daughter's charming hair flip and his tale of a second-generation, mexican-american immigrant's successful rise. ""my grandmother never owned a house. she cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own. but she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college,"" he said during the 2012 address. ""and my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, i could hold this microphone."" mayors' stories out of school beyond the immigrant son-made-good narrative, castro brings a ""new energy"" to the president's second term, said trey martinez fischer, a democratic texas state representative who heads that body's mexican american legislative caucus. ""it's very important to note is that he brings a fresh perspective and new energy to this president's second term, fischer said.

"-- severe flooding across serbia has prompted the evacuation of at least 16,300 people -- including 1,100 whisked away on helicopters -- the government said saturday. a spokesman for the interior ministry confirmed there have been at least 15 deaths in serbia and another five in neighboring bosnia-herzegovina. unconfirmed reports put the numbers even higher. it's the worst flooding serbia has seen since the country began keeping records 120 years ago, according to meteorologists. the catastrophic weather has prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency in bosnia-herzegovina, according to a government statement. bosnian authorities say the flooded town of maglaj received the average rainfall for a two-month period in less than two days. speaking at a press conference, serbian prime minister aleksandar vucic said that the situation in his country is ""difficult,"" but that serbia is prepared for the next wave of floods. more rising waters are expected sunday evening near sabac, a city in western serbia near the sava river. vucic said that sabac is well fortified and that authorities had done ""everything that could be done."" the prime minister pointed out that a dam 7.3 meters tall (24 feet) has been erected, but that the current level of the sava river is over 6.3 meters -- a historic high. the river is expected to rise. he warned that it is difficult to predict what will happen if the river reaches 6.8 meters, or slightly more than 22 feet. rescuers in the hard-hit town of obrenovac, 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) southwest of belgrade, have recovered the first bodies of flood victims, according to vucic. he expressed concern over how many may eventually be found once waters subside. authorities estimate that 90% of the town has been flooded. the prime minister thanked the many countries that have already come to serbia's aid. he was especially grateful to members of the russian special forces, highlighting one member who swam 200 meters in cold water to save several people. according to finance minister dusan vujovic, more than 10,000 troops have already been involved in rescue and assistance operations.",worst flooding the region has seen in at least 120 years
"-- it's not just any old talent show, it's an institution -- an annual event that attracts an estimated global audience of 125 million. but to the uninitiated, the eurovision song contest can seem a mystifying cultural anomaly. each year, this relic of the post-war era inspires scores of camped-up performers to perform even camper songs in a self-conscious display of continental unity. but don't let that put you off. from sweden to spain, portugal to poland, the show gathers an ever more devoted following each year -- and 125 million people can't all be wrong, can they? so, if you haven't seen it -- and don't know the first thing about what you're missing -- keep reading. forgettable song, memorable outfit: the crazy clothes of eurovision who competes? forget the ""euro-"" prefix. contestants can come from any member country of the european broadcasting union (ebu) which includes numerous non-european nations. bizarrely enough, the boundaries of the ebu are determined by the catchment area of telegraphy cables built in the 19th and 20th centuries, extending to israel, armenia, morocco and, let's not forget, azerbaijan. melodifestivalen: sweden's not-so-guilty eurovision pleasure why? contrary to popular belief, the eurovision song contest was not forged in the flames of international unity. according to dr karen fricker, co-director of the eurovision research network, the contest was set up for the practical purpose of testing the scope of new broadcast technology in the 1950s. ""the whole gloss we put on it that it's about uniting europe is actually a misrepresentation,"" she said. ""eurovision was set up not to unite europe in song, but to test the latest broadcast technology,"" she said. ""the ebu needed content so thought, 'let's create a song contest,'"" she said. the contest caught on, and has endured as a reliable ratings hit for the broadcasters of participating nations. so who chooses the acts? the ebu is made up of broadcasters, not governments, and each year it is up to the participating broadcaster from each country to submit one act chosen through their own selection process. the prospect of a ready-made domestic audience and a studio full of premium-rate phone lines often proves an irresistible draw to broadcasters, many of whom conduct their selection through a national public telephone voting contest. in fact, some countries' national finals produce a greater public frenzy than eurovision itself. in sweden, melodifestivalen (literally, melody festival) is the biggest entertainment event of the year, with 32 songs competing in stadia around the country to become the nation's eurovision entry. then what? since the early 1990s there have been more countries eager to compete in the contest than would be sensible to include on one already marathon tv show. this prompted a wave of convoluted screening processes -- most of them short-lived -- until the ebu began broadcasting semi-finals in 2008. the semi-finals are conducted along the same lines as the final (more on that later), except there's two of them. each country performs their song and is judged by all the other countries in their semi-final group. unlike the final, however, the tally of votes won is kept under wraps, with the successful qualifiers simply announced while the losers are sent packing. the process applies to everyone except the previous year's winner (who earns the automatic right to host and compete in the next contest) as well as the big five of france, germany, italy, spain and the united kingdom -- all of whom qualify automatically. that doesn't sound fair. it isn't, but you get what you pay for. the big five are the biggest financial contributors to the contest, and without them the high production costs simply wouldn't be met. so what happens on the big night? one by one, the performers from each nation get on stage and sing their hearts out, often wearing a flamboyant outfit and performing a dance routine. until 1999, each entry was obliged to sing along with a live orchestra, but since a rule change scrapped the requirement, no one ever does. live instrumentation is not permitted. this rule exists because there isn't enough time to wire the instruments during the short break between the songs. on the other hand, the backing tape can't have any vocals as live singing is (for the time being) what it's all about. after the performances, there's an intermission. convention dictates that this is an opportunity for the host nation to launch a long musical advertisement for itself. then the moment that everyone's been waiting for (and, it is said, the moment that most people tune in): the voting. finally! so, how does that work? countries award a set of points from one to eight, then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs. they can't vote for themselves and, for a much needed dose of sophistication, they must announce the score in both english and french. until the late 1990s, a mysterious jury of music industry experts -- sequestered somewhere in the capital city of each participating nation -- were the contest's soul arbiters. but since 1997, when a handful of nations experimented with televoting -- giving people in those countries the opportunity to vote for their favorite songs over the phone -- the public choice has counted for half the final vote. in a surprisingly straightforward conclusion, the winner is quite simply the country with the most points. which countries have the strongest track record? the notorious luck of the irish seems to have turned on its head when it comes to eurovision. ireland is head and shoulders above the field with seven wins to its name, including a run of three consecutive victories in 1992, 1993 and 1994. france, the uk and luxembourg each have five wins to their credit. sweden now has five wins, and the netherlands have four, while israel and norway have a respectable three wins each. do all the winners go on to fame and fortune? no. one of the few ""rules"" that has remained consistent since the contest's inception in 1956 is that winners are rarely heard from again. among the few notable exceptions are abba, who won in 1974 with ""waterloo,"" and celine dion, who was imported from quebec to represent switzerland in the 1988 contest.",the eurovision song contest is one of the most watched non-sporting events in the world

""both passed away in ellison's cave in walker county and their bodies are at the state medical examiner's office now,"" ashburn said. ""we think grant went down first and michael went down to help him."" their bodies were removed from the cave late saturday, he said. they were part of a group of five guys and five girls who were exploring the crockford-pigeon mountain wildlife management area in lafayette, ashburn said. walker county sheriff steve wilson said affiliate wtvc that pirie and lockenbach broke away from the group and decided to explore by themselves. ""they were only dressed in t-shirts and jogging shorts and certainly were not dressed appropriately for going in a cave,"" wilson said. other members of the group were able to communicate with the men for up to 45 minutes, but their voices eventually grew faint and disappeared. lockenbach was president of the fellowship of christian athletes, which held a prayer service for the two students sunday night, the orlando sentinel reported. pirie was also a member of fca and played in the university of florida drumline.",the bodies of the students are recovered over the weekend
"-- the e-mail arrived from uzbekistan on february 26. it was titled ""bad news."" abdul dadahanov had intended to study business, but changed his mind after 9/11, his academic adviser said. ""dear mama judy,"" a young woman named aziza dadahanov wrote in shaky english. ""very very bad news!!! abdul is given 8 years of prison. today was the verdict. now i feel myself very bad. and i can't write now. i am shocked."" ""it was like being kicked in the stomach,"" recalled judy skartvedt, a retired flight attendant living in easton, connecticut. she knew dadahanov's husband, abdul dadahanov, as an uzbek exchange student who had wanted to help heal people after the 9/11 attacks. she thought of him as an open-minded muslim whom her family had hosted when he came on a scholarship to study at fairfield university in 2001. ""we were totally shocked that someone like abdul could be arrested for anything,"" skartvedt said. ""we haven't stopped worrying about his safety."" the 32-year-old faces eight years in a labor camp for participation in what the uzbekistan government says is an extremist religious organization, according to forum 18, a religious freedom watchdog organization the group says that uzbek security forces arrested dadahanov and four other men -- bakhrom ibrahimov, davron kabilov, rovshanbek favoyev and botyrbek eshkuziyev -- last summer after the men had written for an islamic journal called irmoq. the national security service reportedly claimed the magazine was ""sponsored by a turkish radical religious movement."" officials from the embassy of uzbekistan in washington have refused to comment on the case. forum 18 says dadahanov and the four other uzbek men were convicted of ""dissemination of information and materials containing ideas of religious extremism, separatism and fundamentalism, calls for pogroms or violent eviction of individuals aimed at creating panic among the population."" human rights organizations say the convictions appear to be part of a broader crackdown in the former soviet republic, targeting members of ""nurchilar,"" a moderate muslim movement of turkish origin, which follows the writing of a 19th-century sufi muslim theologian. ""unfortunately this is not an unusual case,"" said igor vorontsov, a researcher with human rights watch in st. petersburg. ""the [uzbek] government has persisted in its persecution of independent muslims."" thousands of miles from the republic of uzbekistan, news of dadahanov's jail sentence has stunned academics and christian community leaders in connecticut. they fondly describe a committed social activist and observant muslim, who rode between work and classes on a secondhand bicycle and spent more than a year distributing food to soup kitchens in one of america's poorer cities. ""he had a naive trust in the goodness of human beings,"" said patty jenson, an administrator at the council of churches of greater bridgeport. ""i am shocked. i know he is there [in prison] unjustly. what is happening is unjust."" ""he was a man of his word, he was gentle and kind,"" said charlene chambers, the director of king's pantry, a nonprofit organization that distributes food to homeless people in bridgeport. ""our common bond was feeding people who can't feed themselves and clothing those people who can't clothe themselves."" dadahanov's academic adviser, katherine kidd, said the young uzbek originally intended to study business when he arrived at fairfield university on a scholarship from the open society institute of the soros foundation. that changed september 11, 2001. kidd choked up as she recalled his visit to her office, hours after the terrorist attacks. ""he said, 'dr. kidd, i have to do something to tell people that this is not what islam is about.' he said, 'i want to be part of things that are done here to bring healing to people after 9/11.' "" dadahanov began working closely with kidd's husband, pastor john kidd, who was a lutheran minister and the executive director of the council of churches of greater bridgeport. pastor kidd helped dadahanov tour churches and work with synagogues, giving lectures on his interpretation of islam. dadahanov also appeared before audiences dressed in traditional central asian attire, in an effort to spread cultural awareness about uzbekistan. advisers say the young uzbek was inspired by his interaction with church and community groups. gradually, he shifted his academic focus from business to grassroots community service and education reform. ""he would regularly say 'wow, how can i do this in uzbekistan, and make my country and my community better and stronger?'"" katherine kidd explained. dadahanov helped establish a small prayer room for muslim students at fairfield university. he also launched a book drive, shipping secondhand books to uzbekistan to help teach english in his home country. and he was eventually hired at the council of churches, and tasked with distributing federal emergency management agency funds to 26 feeding programs across bridgeport. ""he wanted to be involved in the frontline programs,"" john kidd said. ""ultimately, it's sad that all these things he came to see in terms of how you build a community, how you take responsibility for the life of a community, is at least in part what put him at odds with the authorities in uzbekistan."" when he returned to uzbekistan in 2004 after two and a half years in connecticut, dadahanov set up an english-language school with friends. the school offered english lessons to young uzbeks at an affordable price -- a remarkable achievement in a society in which the government controls almost all facets of the economy. there is little tolerance for independent grassroots activism in uzbekistan. the country has had the same authoritarian president, islam karimov, since it won independence from the soviet union in 1991. the state department's recently published 2008 human rights report states ""torture remain systemic in [uzbekistan's] law enforcement ... human rights activists and journalists who criticized the government continued to be subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, politically motivated prosecution, forced psychiatric treatment and physical attack."" uzbek security forces frequently target religious activists. ""the government has almost a paranoia of any independent religious activity, particularly those related to islam,"" said sean roberts, a central asia expert at george washington university. ""the uzbek government tries to control the religious sector very similar to the way the soviets did. they have a state muslim board that oversees what is proper islam - anything that falls out of that scope is seen as threatening and seditious."" the uzbek government says it ""views the ensuring of human rights and freedoms of its citizens as its highest priority."" a statement posted on the web site of the embassy of uzbekistan in washington cited the passage of more then 120 laws and 60 international treaties aimed at improving the country's human rights record. the uzbek government says it is making reforms of its judicial and penitentiary system, aimed at ""prosecuting and punishing for the use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment."" dadahanov's former professors invited him to return on a scholarship to the united states after his arrest, and two families offered to house dadahanov, his wife aziza and young son abdulrahman. dr. orin grossman, fairfield university's academic vice president, hoped the graduate school offer would allow uzbek authorities to release dadahanov. ""it obviously didn't work,"" he wrote in an e-mail to cnn. accounts of appalling conditions in uzbek prisons have worried dadahanov's american friends, who remember how the slim uzbek rode to barbecues on his bicycle, carrying a giant watermelon in a backpack as a gift. the hardest part has been trying to get information from dadahanov's family in tashkent. ""the government is tapping their phone and tracking their e-mail,"" katherine kidd said. ""we're pretty much sure neither of those is secure from the government.""","abdul dadahanov jailed in uzbekistan, accused of extremist religious activities"
"what do you give the sheik who's already checked palaces and private planes off his royal wish list? how about a menagerie of exotic animals? that's partly the story of how a noah's ark of indigenous and introduced species came to populate sir bani yas, once an inhospitable salt dome island in the arabian gulf. part of abu dhabi emirate, the previously private royal playground now welcomes visitors seeking an arabian safari experience combined with an encounter with that non-indigenous desert species, the multi-star luxury hotel. animal-loving emir the founder and first ruler of the united arab emirates, sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan started collecting many of the species now thriving in the island's huge wildlife park after, so the story goes, being given a bevy of exotic creatures as a gift when exploring africa as a young royal. long before cheetahs, giraffes, ethiopian hedgehogs -- and well-heeled tourists -- were introduced to sir bani yas, however, sheik zayed was transforming the island with a particular aim: to save a native species that had virtually been wiped out. the arabian oryx, a kind of antelope, was officially declared extinct in the wild in the late 1960s. its plight moved the animal-loving emir to begin developing sir bani yas (named after the local bani yas tribe) as a place to protect it. only the oryx ""the oryx is the main reason the island is the way it is today,"" says matt bottomer, an adventure guide who familiarizes visitors staying on sir bani yas with its many resident creatures. ""sheikh zayed searched the world to see if there were any oryx in captivity. ""he found a handful and started a breeding program here."" to prepare the island for those few remaining antelope in the early 1970s, the late sheik launched an extravagant project that might now be seen as a precursor to other slightly incongruous middle eastern behemoths, such as dubai's indoor ski resort. he decided literally to make the desert bloom. once desert, now forest hundreds of thousands of trees, including acacia, ghaf (the national tree of the uae), frankincense, gum and mangrove were planted in the desert scrubland of the 87-square-kilometer island to create a habitat for the oryx and other animals. the first trees didn't fare so well. the antelope nibbled away at them a bit too eagerly, and they had to be replanted. they've since grown to a forest of 4 million, irrigated by desalinated water pumped through an undersea pipeline from the mainland, giving the island an improbably green sheen in this desert environment. as for the oryx, ""now we have around 500 on sir bani yas,"" bottomer explains. the herd has become healthy enough that animals bred on the island are released into the desert wilds of the mainland. indeed, some species have come to feel so at home in the wildlife park that other animals have been brought in to keep their numbers down. cheetahs were shipped over to eat the arabian sand gazelle, which they hunt in the wild, hyenas and jackals were brought in to clean up anything the big cats left. animal spectacle all of this makes for a great spectacle. only a limited number of visitors were allowed on the island when the wildlife park was established in the 1970s. the weekend tours became so popular they had to be booked more than a year in advance. since sheik zayed's death, in 2004, sir bani yas has gradually become more accessible. reached by a 50-seat plane from dubai or abu dhabi, or a 250-kilometer drive from the uae capital followed by a ferry crossing, sir bani yas recreates a wilderness, but you won't be staying in a tent. accommodation is in one of three luxury resorts, meaning the wind-down from exploring the wildlife park on a safari-style drive, by foot on a guided walk or by mountain bike, is pretty pampered. wild drives ""you can get really close to the animals on the wildlife drives,"" bottomer says. ""i've driven along and the cheetahs have been five meters from the car."" guided wadi hikes in the mountains, nature walks on the southeast of the island and mountain biking inside and outside the park are even more direct ways of experiencing the territory. ""each offers the chance to find different animals in different habitats,"" bottomer says. the animals are the main attraction for most visitors, but you can also kayak along the mangrove shores or scuba dive off the island. funnily enough, one of animal you won't spot on sir bani yas is a camel. these ships of the desert do well enough on the mainland without needing the island's protection they were also probably never a terribly original idea as a gift for a royal sheik. getting there rotana jet (+971 2 444 3366) flies from abu dhabi and dubai to sir bani yas island, with single fares starting from $54. become chummy enough with the abu dhabi royal family and you might get an invitation to one of two palaces they maintain in the island's southern section. failing that there are three resorts on the island, with accommodation ranging from rooms in a former royal palace to upscale villas, all run by anantara (+971 2 801 5400), which can also arrange day trip tours. rooms from around $220 a night. find out more about visiting bani yas at desert islands abu dhabi.","uae founder sheik zayed ""made the desert bloom"" on sir bani yas island"
"-- prosecutors are investigating police actions during a protest earlier this month in which at least 16 people died, the office of the general prosecutor in kazakhstan said thursday. at least 80 people were also injured in the december 16 clashes between police and striking oil workers in the oil town of zhanaozen, according to state media. a 20-day state of emergency was declared following the unrest, which also spilled over to a nearby village, where at least one person died as protesters blocked a passenger train in a show of support for the oil workers. a spokeswoman for the organization for security and co-operation in europe, virginie coulloudon, said kazakhstan had told fellow osce states tuesday that the general prosecutor's office had started its own inquiry into police actions. kazakh authorities said the internal security department of the ministry of internal affairs had also launched an in-house investigation into claims of firearms use by the police, coulloudon said. ""the conclusions of this investigation, according to kazakh sources, should be available within a week,"" she told cnn via email. the kazakh general prosecutor's office said in a statement on its website thursday that 20 people had been detained over involvement in the unrest in zhanaozen, with 18 of the arrests ordered by the court. a criminal case was opened tuesday into the alleged excessive use of force by police who opened fire, it said, but some of the deaths reported from zhanaozen were not related to the actions of law enforcement. the investigation will be headed by a special prosecutor in order to guarantee its objectivity and measures have been adopted to ensure transparency, the statement said. a separate committee has also been formed, with relatives of those detained among its members, to examine claims of unlawful detention and abuse of detainees, it said. at least one person is being investigated for giving ""false information"" to the media about events in zhanaozen, the prosecutor's office added. the trouble came as the former soviet republic celebrated its 20th anniversary of independence and prompted concern that unrest might spread across the oil rich central asian nation. the protest was part of a long-running dispute over low pay and the sacking of some workers. video posted to youtube appeared to show protesters in zhanaozen fleeing a large square amid gunfire, as police advance with riot shields. an injured person is seen being beaten with a baton by what appears to be a policeman. the workers' trade union puts the number of dead at 50 to 70 and says as many as 500 were injured, according to european lawmakers. international rights groups have condemned the violence and subsequent emergency measures imposed by the government, including curbs on communications and freedom of movement, and called for a full investigation. the u.s. state department and a group of 48 european lawmakers also expressed concern. the kazakh authorities announced wednesday that 1 million kazakh tenge ($6,640) would be paid to the families of each of those killed and half that sum to those injured. analysts say the kazakh government is keen to prevent discontent over increasing social inequality, in a country where most ordinary people have not shared in the wealth brought by oil. parliamentary and local elections are due to take place next month. kazakhstan has often boasted of its stability in a region that has seen its share of conflict. the ninth-largest country in the world by area, it has the largest economy of all the central asian states thanks mostly to its natural resources, according to the cia world factbook. cnn's alla eshchenko, sarah jones and laura smith-spark contributed to this report.",new: the kazakh general prosecutor's office has opened a criminal case over police use of force
"-- first came a political row over the rightful winner of ivory coast's presidential election. saturday, two men laid claim to the west african nation's highest post. incumbent laurent gbagbo defied international appeals to step aside and was sworn in as the new president in a formal ceremony inside the presidential palace that was broadcast live on television. less than an hour-and-a-half later, his rival, alassane ouattara, told reporters that he, too, had taken the oath of office and asked prime minister soro guillaume to form a new government. abidjan, under a 7 p.m. curfew, saw an eerie calm fall saturday evening. but the political chaos heightened fears that the ivory coast -- known as cote d'ivoire in french -- would once again plunge into the unrest and bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002. the constitutional council declared gbagbo the winner friday, invalidating earlier results from the independent electoral commission which handed ouattara the victory with 54.1% of the vote. the constitutional council said gbagbo had won the election with 51.45% of the vote to ouattara's 48.55%. it tossed out votes it said were marred by fraud in northern regions that were considered ouattara strongholds. it was the job of y.j. choi, the special envoy in the ivory coast of u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon, to review and sign off on the results. choi said that, even if gbagbo's complaints were taken into consideration, ouattara was the winner. ""having evaluated all the tally sheets, 20,000 of them yesterday evening, we are in a position to know what happened really,"" choi said in a telephone interview from abidjan. ""with absolute certainty, we know that ouattara won the election."" with his credibility in question, gbagbo defied calls from international leaders to respect the will of ivorian voters by taking the oath of office in front of a room full of supporters and military commanders. ""these past days i have noticed serious cases of interference,"" gbagbo said. ""the sovereignty of cote d'ivoire, is not negotiable. my responsibility is to defend it."" meanwhile, the african union stepped into the fray and said it would entrust former south african president thabo mbeki to help determine a rightful end to the dispute. ""the purpose of this mission is to facilitate the rapid and peaceful conclusion of the electoral process and the efforts to find a way out of the crisis in (the ivory coast) on the basis of relevant (african union) decisions and instruments and through consultations with the concerned actors,"" said a statement from the intergovernmental organization. french president nicolas sarkozy appealed for calm and urged military and civilian officials to respect the will of the people. u.s. president barack obama warned gbagbo: ""the international community will hold those who act to thwart the democratic process and the will of the electorate accountable for their actions."" ouattara, a former economist for the international monetary fund who served as prime minister, had been banned from previous races. gbagbo's critics said the incumbent stoked tensions by accusing ouattara of masterminding the civil war. ouattara has denied the allegation. once a prosperous nation and a driving force in west africa, the ivory coast spiraled downward into instability after fighting erupted between the government-held south and discontented muslim rebels living in the north. thousands of people died in the conflict. ouattara enjoys popular support in the rebel-held north and now, with both candidates claiming they are president, the potential exists for more bloodshed. the streets of abidjan have already seen violent clashes in the past few days. journalists francois xavier menage and eric agnero contributed to this report.",laurent gbagbo was named president by one council in the ivory coast

there are several options, from buying a new car with factory-installed bluetooth technology to installing aftermarket wireless products to wearing a wireless headset to abstaining altogether from using a cell phone while driving. aol autos: 10 cars to keep you young here's a breakdown of what you can do to become a hands-free driver: spend nothing -- either abstain from talking while driving altogether or use your cell phone's speakerphone. however, most of these tiny speakers don't deliver enough volume to mask car and road noises, leaving drivers holding their phone up to their ear. according to hands-free laws, this is illegal. also, some drivers are turning to the wired headset that most manufacturers include with your cell phone. aol autos: used luxury cars best buys in ear wear -- although some people find ear pieces uncomfortable or way too geeky, a bluetooth-enabled ear piece is one of the best ways to drive and talk. plantronics makes some of the most affordable ear pieces with good sound quality like the sleek new discovery 925 ($149.95), the modestly-priced voyager 520 ($99.95) and the military grade explorer 370 ($79.95). for those into designer wear, the jawbone ($129.99) looks like a work of art and works as good as it looks. don't want an earpiece? -- wireless speakerphones and aftermarket-installed voice recognition systems have come of age. paris-based parrot started making these systems years ago when most of europe enacted hands-free laws. parrot's minikit ($89) clips to your visor and is basically a mobile speakerphone while parrot's pluggable pmk5800 kit ($119.99) sticks out from your car's cigarette lighter and has some voice recognition capabilities. parrot also has a host of other bluetooth-integrated products that are installed by professionals and do what factory-installed systems can do like automatically turn down your car's audio volume when you get a call. bluetooth basics -- as with any new technology, there's a ramp-up time to feeling comfortable with using wireless technology and its by-products. don't get too frustrated when you can't figure out how to sync your cell phone and that new ear piece. when you need help, calling tech support is sometimes better than reading the manual. also, many older cells phones aren't integrated with bluetooth, nor do they have the software inside to upload important data like your address book. so, you may want to think about upgrading your cell phone before you buy your new mobile wireless device. iphone users beware: bluetooth doesn't seem to be super compatible, although you can perform basic functions with ease. ford's answer: sync it used to be that only luxury cars like mercedes-benz or jaguar had built-in voice recognition systems. now with ford's sync system, most consumers can afford the $395 price tag for this hi-tech option. powered by microsoft, sync is a voice-activated communication and entertainment system. rated in 2007 as popular mechanic's no. 4 ""most brilliant gadgets,"" ford's sync also offers one of the best hands-free calling options to date. the system is rather easy to use and lets drivers bring their digital media players, mp3 players and bluetooth-enabled mobile phones into the vehicle and operate these devices via voice commands or through buttons on the steering wheel and radio controls. so, does sync really work? we recently tested the first generation sync on a 2008 ford focus as well as sync's second generation on ford's super cool new flex cuv. we discovered sync does have its drawbacks as only certain mp3 players and mobile phones are completely compatible with sync's software. on the 2008 ford focus, for example, we could make calls from a palm treo or an apple iphone, but the system did not automatically upload contacts or music files. and, it did take some time getting used to the voice command system. in the ford flex, which looks like a limo-sized mini cooper and drives like a dream, we found the next generation sync to be much more user-friendly with its pleasing digital display and easy-to-use voice commands. if you have a compatible mobile phone, sync can even translate and send your text messages via the system's electronic voice! ford has been the first car manufacturer to implement sync, although its exclusive contract with microsoft ends this year. this means perhaps more auto manufacturers will adopt sync-like software systems after the 2009 model year. gm's solution is to offer hands-free calling via its onstar subscription system. the company says about one million 2009 model year gm vehicles will be equipped with voice-activated bluetooth integration, which uses the vehicle's speaker system. now that you know the laws and have options to comply, are you still confused? well, just like we've been warned for decades about drinking and driving, it now seems that it is time to change your habits and stop talking while behind the wheel.",police in six states can now give you a ticket for talking on your cell phone

"-- whisked to boston to face dozens of charges, including murder and racketeering, captured fugitive james ""whitey"" bulger made a court appearance friday and said he could afford a lawyer ""if you give me my money back."" bulger, 81, appeared before two federal magistrate judges because he faces two 100-plus-page indictments featuring a litany of allegations dating back to the early 1970s. the accused mobster, who authorities said was the leader of the winter hill gang, ""looks forward to facing the charges against him,"" his provisional attorney, peter krupp, said after the proceedings. bulger, arrested after being on the lam 16 years, was transported from california in a private jet, along with his longtime girlfriend, catherine elizabeth greig. they were quickly driven to the courthouse. bulger, greig lived good life in santa monica relatives of some of bulger's alleged victims were in the packed courtroom. bulger, shackled when he entered court, did not seek bail or enter a plea friday. he may ask for bail later. ""he's a murderer and a destroyer of families,"" said tom donahue, who said bulger is responsible for the death of his father, michael. donahue and his mother, patricia donahue, said the fbi should have found bulger before this week. ""(bulger) seemed like a very meek man, spoke very softly, was more concerned about what he had, rather than what's going on in his life,"" patricia donohue told reporters. bulger told a judge he has the money to pay for a lawyer ""if you give me my money back."" the fbi said it found more than $800,000 in cash at the suspect's california apartment. assistant u.s. attorney brian kelly said that, based on a conversation with greig, prosecutors believe massachusetts political figure william bulger will help pay for his brother's defense. the prosecutor said he believes the reputed mob boss has significant resources. ""he didn't earn $800,000 working a paper route along the santa monica boulevard,"" kelly said. william bulger, former president of the massachusetts state senate, smiled at his brother during the proceedings. william bulger had no substantive comment when he left the courthouse. bulger vanished in 1995 into lore and became the inspiration for the 2006 martin scorsese film ""the departed."" he was nabbed by the fbi on wednesday night in southern california. bulger was arrested with greig, who is accused of harboring a fugitive. she made an initial appearance before a judge in a separate hearing in boston on friday. greig will have a hearing for counsel tuesday. bulger faces 19 counts of murder, along with conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, narcotics distribution and money laundering charges, the fbi said. he could receive a life sentence if convicted on the more serious charges. bulger had been living in a santa monica apartment and was arrested outside it, the fbi said. neither he nor greig put up a fight, authorities said. after the arrests, members of the fugitive task force, which included the fbi and police, searched the apartment. in addition to the cash, 30 firearms and fake ids were found, the fbi said. a neighbor of the couple, catalina schlank, said greig once confided in her that bulger was in the early stages of alzheimer's. a general manager at michael's, a santa monica restaurant, said the pair had dined there a few times. they made their reservations under the name of ""mr. gasko"" through an internet reservation service, andrew turner said. the couple, who lived two blocks away, kept to themselves and always sat at table 23 in the corner of the garden patio, lush with trees and plants, turner told cnn. in september 2009, bulger and greig allegedly ordered two grey goose vodka cocktails, two chardonnays and foie gras as an appetizer. for an entree, bulger ate a 10-ounce, 28-day aged new york strip streak, and greig ate lobster, turner said. the bill: $192, plus tip, turner said. ""they were pleasant but they kind of kept to themselves and certainly did not have, as far as i can tell, any interaction with any other guests,"" the manager added. the fugitives' run from the law ended wednesday. a tipster called the fbi's los angeles office on tuesday, and the information led authorities to the apartment, said steven martinez, fbi assistant director in charge in los angeles. he would not divulge the city from which the call came. the end of the manhunt came within days of the fbi launching a publicity campaign, airing ads about greig in 14 markets across the country where the couple was known to have ties, authorities said. the arrests were a ""direct result"" of the media campaign, authorities said. but some law enforcement officials outside the fbi say that the media campaign explanation could be a cover for something else. these non-fbi sources said it seems too easy that after so many years on the run and so much exposure, suddenly a public service announcement that doesn't even appear in los angeles leads to a tip. they hinted that maybe the explanation was a smokescreen to protect the real tipster from any harm. tom fuentes, former fbi assistant director, told cnn's anderson cooper that the agency is capable of protecting the tipster no matter how the information came in and there is no reason for a ruse. the version that fuentes heard from investigators in the case and others is that ""the person that called in the tip did not see the direct announcement but saw the media coverage that the fbi had done an announcement on one of the cable network channels, and they wouldn't tell me which one."" a law enforcement official with knowledge of the case verified that version of events. a ""tipster was watching national coverage of the fbi campaign, went to fbi.gov, where they saw additional photos, then called the fbi with the tip,"" the official said. the boston fbi officially buttressed that assertion friday. ""any claim that the fbi knew mr. bulger's whereabouts prior to the fbi's publicity efforts this week are completely unfounded,"" fbi special agent richard deslauriers said in a statement. ""when we learned his location, he was arrested promptly."" carmen ortiz, u.s. attorney for the district of massachusetts, said she believes the death penalty is not an option in the federal charges bulger faces in her district, but that she believes he could face the death penalty for two cases outside the district -- in florida and oklahoma. dick lehr, who wrote a book about bulger, described him as a cold-blooded killer whose gang went to lengths to avoid detection. ""when they killed someone -- this is pre-dna -- they pulled the teeth out, cut the fingers off, tried to make it so the victims, if they were discovered from their graves, couldn't be identified. there's just no bottom. it doesn't get much uglier than someone like whitey bulger,"" lehr told cooper. cnn's deborah feyerick, sheila steffen, michael martinez, drew griffin and carey bodenheimer contributed to this report.",new: restaurant manager recalls the pair's fancy meal
"for the 108,000 women who are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, lung cancer awareness month can be a lonely time of year. lung cancer kills nearly twice as many women as breast cancer. but november, unlike october and breast cancer awareness month, goes practically unnoticed: no sea of ribbons, no colored nfl cleats, no national monuments aglow in pink. breast cancer is a terrible disease. my grandmother fought and beat it twice, benefiting from innovative treatments that have propelled five-year survival rates to 90%. but the five-year survival rate for lung cancer has hovered around 16% for decades. and for someone like my mom, who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, the survival rate is an appallingly low 4%. an indiscriminate killer, lung cancer takes more lives annually than breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers combined. the disease has not generally received the public attention or research dollars in proportion to its devastating lethality. lung cancer receives just $1,442 in federal research funds per death, compared with $26,398 for breast cancer and $13,419 for prostate cancer according to an nih study. factor in private donations, and the funding gap becomes even more staggering. often portrayed as a ""smoker's disease,"" the majority of those diagnosed with lung cancer are former smokers or have never smoked at all. and while smoking history shouldn't matter as nicotine is highly addictive, all lung cancer patients face the same unrelenting stigma. my mom never smoked -- in fact, studies show one in five women diagnosed with lung cancer never smoked -- and so her lingering, months-long cough didn't trigger any red flags. in fact, her doctors were certain she had pneumonia. that is until her ct scan came back showing the mass in her lung. an otherwise healthy, vibrant, beautiful woman, my mom was given less than a year to live. thanks to advancements in targeted therapies, my mom survived -- thrived, in many respects -- for more than 40 months. she lived long enough to walk me down the aisle, attend my youngest brother's high school graduation, watch my dad make a lasagna from scratch and fulfill a lifetime wish to hike the hills of sedona and visit the grand canyon. but in july 2013, after an unbelievably courageous and inspiring fight, my mom passed away. she was 59. it's impossible to describe adequately how special my mom was. she was incredibly caring, equanimous, brave and nonjudgmental. she possessed patience and calmness so rarely encountered -- and in short supply in a family full of strong personalities. she was the ballast that kept our family upright and moving forward. while lung cancer robbed my family of an unbelievably special mom and spouse, there is so much we can do to ensure happier endings for other lung cancer patients and their families. whether you are a lung cancer survivor, caregiver, advocate or just someone who wants to join the fight, there is much we can do to bring our country's no. 1 cancer killer out of the shadows. • visit uniting against lung cancer, free to breathe, the bonnie j. addario lung cancer foundation or the lungevity foundation for great resources, local events and patient support groups. • write a letter to your local newspaper, urging greater public awareness or encouraging corporate sponsors to step up in support of the lung cancer fight. • join the growing #lcsm (lung cancer social media) community on twitter. • if you are in a high-risk group -- a heavy long-term smoker -- see your doctor about ct screening. sadly, over the next five years, more than 1 million americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer. they will be our mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, co-workers and closest friends. together, we can help them.","lung cancer awareness month doesn't get attention it deserves, arielle densen says"

"-- yes, they exist. and there might be more of them than you think. fifteen percent of adults in the united states are not online, for reasons that range from lack of interest to fear of the unknown to not being able to afford a computer, says a new survey. and guess what? almost all of them are ok with it. according to the report from the pew internet & american life project, 92% of respondents who said they aren't on the internet also said they have no desire to be. the survey this spring used phone interviews with 2,252 adults who were 18 years old or older. it has a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points. as in earlier pew studies, it appears that older americans and those with less education are the least likely to be online. web usage was also slightly lower among rural americans and hispanics. forty-four percent of adults 65 or older said they don't use the internet. by comparison, only 2% of those between 18-29 said the same. but education was almost as strong a factor as age in the results. a full 41% of americans who didn't get a high school diploma said they aren't on the web, compared to just 4% who said they have a college degree. by far, the most popular reason given was some version of ""i just don't care about it."" more than one-third said they are ""just not interested,"" ""don't need it/don't want it,"" or ""think it's a waste of time."" less popular, but interesting, reasons included not having a computer (13%), saying web access is too expensive (6%) and being limited by poor eyesight or another physical disability (4%). for all the talk recently about web security, government snooping and the like, only 3% of respondents said they don't go online because of worries about things like privacy, viruses, spam and hackers. even among the offline contingent, the web's broad reach was apparent. more than 4 out of 10 of nonconnected people said they'd asked a friend or family member to look something up or complete a task online for them, and nearly a quarter say they live in a household where someone else uses the web.",survey: 15% of u.s. adults say they aren't on the web

""they were playing with a shotgun, and when it went off on bradley, he didn't know what to do, took his body and dumped it on the street,"" the father told wfaa. authorities told reporters that they reviewed the case closely before making it a capital offense. ""if a person is making the assertion this was an accident -- you place the body in a vehicle and moved it to a second location -- that in itself, coupled with the fact that property is missing, makes this a capital murder,"" said deputy chief craig miller. a cell phone and shoes were the missing property, said dallas police spokesman kevin janse. paul johnson, van exel's attorney, told cnn the shooting was the result of ""horseplay."" ""the young men were involved in a bunch of horseplay. they didn't believe it was loaded and, unfortunately, it was,"" johnson said. ""unfortunately, there was a tragic result to the horseplay."" the two men had been friends for years and were neighbors who lived across the street from each other, johnson said. van exel does not live with his father, johnson said. ""everybody considered them to be like brothers,"" the attorney said of the two young men. when asked why van exel allegedly moved the body, johnson said van exel went ""into a state of shock and panic.""

""for the over 900 million people that use facebook, the app center will become the new, central place to find great apps like draw something, pinterest, spotify, battle pirates, viddy, and bubble witch saga,"" facebook's aaron brady wrote on the site's page for developers. a life without facebook: are you off the site? tell us why the center will be available on the web and on both apple's ios and google's android operating systems. it will roll out to users over the next few weeks, according to brady's post. facebook will use ""a variety of signals, such as user ratings and engagement"" to determine which apps are added to the app center and which get most prominently displayed. ""well-designed apps that people enjoy will be prominently displayed,"" brady wrote. ""apps that receive poor user ratings or don't meet the quality guidelines won't be listed."" developers are being asked to create an app detail page, that will give potential users details about the app and be accessible to web searches. those pages are due by may 18, signaling that a full rollout might not happen until after then. and in a move that mirrors apple and android app stores, developers will now be given the option of charging a one-time fee for their apps. ""many developers have been successful with in-app purchases, but to support more types of apps on facebook.com, we will give developers the option to offer paid apps,"" brady wrote. facebook currently makes about 15% of its money through payments in games and other apps. zynga, owners of farmville, draw something and other successful games, are responsible for the majority of those payments. facebook takes a 30% cut of the payments. the center rolls out at an opportune time for facebook, as it prepares for an initial public stock offering. facebook has not yet found a way to make money on the increasing number of users who access the site through mobile devices. becoming more visible to iphone and android users may be a move in that direction, easing investor concerns in the process. most initial tech-world reactions thursday were positive.

"-- when america's financial institutions crumbled and housing values plummeted, cities and families across the nation felt the tremendous impact. almost overnight, the reality of how we live our lives and govern our communities shifted dramatically. to make matters worse, no road map to help us navigate these new and troubled waters was delivered to our doorstep. it had to be created. endless dialogue and analysis about whether or not the american recovery and reinvestment act (arra) is working has become a cottage industry among economists, professors and political commentators. the debate of whether or not the stimulus has in fact ""stimulated"" our economy will continue for months, and possibly years to come. but the picture in phoenix, arizona, is clear: because of arra, key projects are under way, our environment is improving -- and thousands of people are going back to work. meet james ceaton. phoenix has more than 300 days of sunshine a year, so it doesn't surprise anyone to learn that a key to our local economy is tourism. moving individuals in and out of phoenix sky harbor international airport efficiently is critical to our economy. at a time when our economy had slowed to a point where new infrastructure projects did not seem possible, the city was awarded $11.7 million from arra to reconstruct a taxiway at the airport. until now, the taxiway was able to handle only small aircraft and ground vehicles. when complete, it will be capable of moving large commercial aircraft between the north runway and the terminals at sky harbor. ceaton is a construction worker who was hired for the job. ""without the stimulus,"" he told the phoenix business journal, ""i would still be out of a job."" because of the stimulus, though, he continues to work, to support a family, to pay a mortgage and to make purchases that contribute to our economy. meet the lovato family. while cities on the east coast struggle to keep utility bills low for residents during cold winter months, our hot summer months can cause a significant economic burden on phoenix residents. the lovato family in central phoenix was the first family of 1,200 households that will benefit from the city's $7.2 million arra weatherization grant during the next three years. weatherizing the lovatos' home is expected to shave 30 percent to 40 percent from the family's $440 monthly energy bill. the project also employed six full-time and a dozen part-time workers. scott lovato, who lives with his wife, angela, and two children, christian, 13 and sarai, 11, commented, ""at a time when the economy really stinks and people were out of work, a lot of people were working on this,"" he said. ""this put paychecks in their pockets so they could feed their families. i think that is probably the best thing out of all of this."" meet jeanne simons. simons is a seventh- and eighth-grade teacher at gateway school in phoenix. last year, she was told that if arra funds were not approved, she would lose her teaching position. if her position had been eliminated, the remaining teachers would have faced class sizes of between 40 and 50 students -- a daunting task for any educator to face. ceaton, the lovato family and simons are only three of the thousands of phoenicians who continue to be employed and contribute to our economy. and they, and we, have the arra to thank for it. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of phil gordon.",phoenix mayor phil gordon says the stimulus is creating jobs in his city
"-- jose mourinho will leave real madrid at the end of the season, the nine-time european champion's president florentino perez announced at a news conference on monday. by his own admission mourinho, who won one la liga crown and a copa del rey with real after taking charge in 2010, has endured what he has called his ""worst season"" in management. ""the club and manager agree that the timing is right to bring the relationship to an end,"" said perez. ""on behalf of the board of directors, i would like to thank jose mourinho for all his hard work over the last three years."" mourinho will stay on for real's remaining league fixtures, with an away trip to real sociedad on may 26 and a final home game at the bernabeu on june 1 against osasuna. real will finish second in la liga this year, trailing champions barcelona by 12 points after 36 rounds. the parting of ways comes three days after mourinho was sent off as real lost the copa del rey final 2-1 to atletico madrid, a first defeat by their neighbors in 14 years. real president perez explained that the decision was a ""mutual agreement"", so paving the way for mourinho to make a return to england's premier league. ""i know in england i am loved,"" said the portuguese last month. ""i know i am loved by some clubs, especially one."" the 50-year-old has been heavily linked with a return to former club chelsea, where he won two premier league titles and one fa cup between 2004 and 2007. this year's europa league champions will be without a coach on june 1, with the contract for interim manager rafa benitez expiring at the end of may. the decision to part ways via ""mutual agreement"" means neither real nor mourinho will have to pay one another millions of dollars in compensation had either of them broken the terms of their contract. after winning la liga last year, mourinho had signed a new four-year deal with the merengues. the compensation package was believed to be a potential obstacle to his return to stamford bridge, where chelsea owner roman abramovich paid mourinho and his coaching staff some $27 million after his contract ended early in 2007. paris saint-germain coach carlo ancelotti, who formerly led chelsea himself, is rumored to be mourinho's replacement. on monday, perez denied that any deal has been agreed to replace the former inter milan and porto manager. ""we have no pre-contract signed with any managerial candidate,"" he said. ""it's something we'll have to look at in the coming days."" ancelotti confirmed on sunday that he had asked to leave the french champions, while the club's qatari owners suggested he already had an agreement in place with real. desperate to be crowned champions of europe for a record tenth time, with their last success dating back to 2002, real madrid turned to mourinho just days after he lifted the champions league with inter milan, ending a barren 35-year run for the italians. yet the portuguese was beaten in the semifinals of the competition each year with real, who were knocked out by borussia dortmund last month. without a trophy in the two years prior to his arrival, mourinho did at least return silverware to the club - winning the copa del rey in his first season in charge. in 2012, he guided real madrid to their first league crown in four years and amassed a record tally of 100 points along the way, so eclipsing the previous best held by great rivals barcelona. a new deal soon followed but matters soured this season as mourinho clashed with several star players, notably goalkeeper iker casillas -- who was demoted from the first team in recent months -- sergio ramos and pepe. during his 176 games in charge, mourinho has led madrid to 127 victories - losing just 22 games along the way.",jose mourinho to leave real madrid at end of season

"(cnn)more than 18 months ago, the body of odin lloyd was found in an industrial park in north attleboro, massachusetts. lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. the semipro football player for the boston bandits was 27. days after he was found dead, then-nfl star aaron hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. testimony in the case against hernandez began this week. hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. he has pleaded not guilty. the charges mark the latest turn in hernandez's downward spiral. just two years ago, he was one of the nfl's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the new england patriots. friends and fans alike wonder: how could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder? from 'golden boy' to behind bars long before hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in bristol, connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. ""i don't think there was another family that was more familiar in bristol,"" bob montgomery, who covers high school sports for the bristol press, told cnn. the young hernandez was the ""golden boy,"" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. ""i saw a closeness with them that i'd never seen before,"" montgomery said of the relationship between hernandez and his father. but his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in january 2007 to join the university of florida gators, and trouble seemed to follow. in just his first semester, a police report says hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. the following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. police reports link hernandez and several other university of florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. at the time, hernandez's mother told the orlando sentinel newspaper, ""i know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting."" the case remains open, and no one has been charged. hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, hernandez wrote a letter to the patriots director of personnel. ""if you draft me as a member of the new england patriots, i will willfully submit to a bi-weekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... in addition, i will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,"" he wrote, according to the boston globe. before the draft, hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. he was passed over until the fourth round, when the patriots selected him. by the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension. less than a year after signing the deal, however, the patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with lloyd's murder. the killing of odin lloyd when odin lloyd pulled up in a black chevrolet suburban, boston bandits coach mike branch thought something was out of place. lloyd didn't own a car. aaron hernandez case: who's who? branch had his suspicions, but he couldn't get answers. lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night. ""he said he was at the club with mr. hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that mr. hernandez spent a good amount of money,"" branch recalled. lloyd said hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. lloyd's friends say he wasn't a big partier. he was more passionate about football and family. remembering odin lloyd lloyd was dating shaneah jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the nfl and the all-american who made it. jenkins is the younger sister of shayanna, who's engaged to hernandez and the mother of his little girl. on june 16, 2013, lloyd was riding with friends in the black suburban, which police later learned was rented by hernandez. daryl hodge was with lloyd when he said lloyd got a text from hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. as they parted ways, lloyd told hodge he'd see him later. the next day, lloyd's body was found. prosecutors say lloyd was last seen with hernandez and hernandez's two associates, carlos ortiz and ernest wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver nissan altima. surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. at the same time, chilling text messages from lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with ""nfl,"" adding, ""just so u know."" between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. at 3:29, a camera showed an altima pulling into hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. three people got out of the car, and lloyd was not one of them. nine days later, hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapon-related charges. he has pleaded not guilty. in april, ortiz and wallace were also charged in lloyd's slaying. they, too, have pleaded not guilty. prosecutors say the three men are being tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in lloyd's murder. as the trial for the death of lloyd has neared, lawyers have been arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. some rulings are victories for the defense. the jury won't see the text lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with ""nfl."" the judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hasn't proven lloyd believed his life was in danger. jurors also won't hear anything about what happened in boston on july 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where hernandez had been. the judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to lloyd's murder. did spilled drink lead to slaying? investigators allege hernandez shot and killed daniel abreu and safiro furtado because one bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. district attorney patrick haggan described the scene in a massachusetts courtroom in may, saying hernandez became ""angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after mr. abreu smiled and did not apologize."" prosecutors: bump, spilled drink led to double homicide hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. court documents identify that friend as alexander bradley, who would go on to accuse hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. (if bradley testifies during the trial for the murder of lloyd, he cannot talk about allegedly being shot by hernandez, the judge ruled). after leaving the second nightclub, hernandez and the friend returned to their suv and pulled over on a nearby street where hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, haggan said. hernandez began trailing abreu, furtado and three of their friends in his suv, authorities said. he then pulled up to the victims' car at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, haggan told the court. hernandez allegedly said, ""yo, what's up now,"" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, haggan said. abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, haggan said. hernandez was charged in the double homicide in may, and he pleaded not guilty. investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of lloyd. as for the lloyd case, hernandez's lawyers contend the circumstantial evidence has gaps. ""there's certainly a lot of what i would call smoke. there's no doubt about it,"" defense lawyer jamie sultan said during a june 16 hearing. ""but that's not probable cause that he committed murder. and you can't just throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and say that's good enough."" now, a jury will decide. there is a gag order prohibiting the defense and prosecution from commenting on the case. hernandez's lawyers and mother declined to be interviewed, but both predict he will be cleared. it's a possibility that haunts lloyd's loved ones. ""that's my biggest fear,"" michael branch, lloyd's former coach and mentor, said. ""all it takes is one juror."" cnn's laura dolan, kristi ramsay and michelle rozsa contributed to this report.",jury selection begins this week in trial for murder of odin lloyd

""even then, we heard rumors of the charges, and they kept on changing."" in december, cassim was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of about $2,700. the charges were not read in court, but the country's main english-language newspaper reported that cassim was accused of defaming the uae's image abroad. uae officials would say only that cassim ""was charged under the uae's penal code"" and was ""entitled to the fair trial protections contained in the uae's constitution."" cassim said the reason behind his detention was clear.

"-- i've been a mac user for about 11 years. and since i made the switch, i never thought the day would come when i'd say this: i'm excited for the next version of windows. this fall, microsoft will launch windows 8, a radical redesign from the windows you've grown accustomed to since windows 95 made its debut 17 years ago. windows 8 has been reimagined from the ground up, and it's built to run on both the traditional desktop and touchscreen tablets. at first glance, you'll notice the classic start menu is gone, replaced by a gorgeous tile layout full of your favorite apps and files. microsoft calls this the ""metro"" interface. imagine it as a blown-up version of the windows phone 7 interface used on several smartphones now. those little tiles provide live updates with news, sports, weather, twitter mentions and facebook updates without you even having to open the app. in one quick glance, you can get all the information you need. it's not the same old windows. and that's what makes me so excited to try the final version of windows 8 this fall. in a very un-microsoft move, the company created the most radical redesign of the desktop in well over a decade. it's incredibly functional, too. a beta version windows 8 is available as a free consumer preview, and i've been using it for the last few weeks. right now, there are only a handful of prototype tablets that run windows 8, so i've been using it on a laptop instead. however, since the metro interface is designed more for touch than a mouse cursor, there's a bit of a learning curve with windows 8. scrolling through the start screen can get confusing on a keyboard until you learn all the shortcuts. but once you do, the experience is incredible, unlike any operating system i've ever used. it's the perfect hybrid of old and new. while apple attempts slowly to merge its mobile operating system into the desktop with new iphone-like features, microsoft made a bold move and jumped ahead to the future where most computing takes place on touch-friendly smartphones and tablets. it's enough to make an apple fan like me drool. but what if you're worried you won't be able to catch on to the new look in windows 8? the classic windows is still there in windows 8. microsoft hid it behind the metro interface. that means you get the same old taskbar, start menu and desktop full of icons for your favorite apps. it's a great way to ease the transition. plus, some apps such as excel and powerpoint just work better on the classic desktop. of course, it's far too early to tell if microsoft's gamble with windows 8 will pay off. consumers have been slow to adopt windows phones, and windows 8 is essentially just a blown-up version of that. but if microsoft can get me this pumped up over a new product, then it must be doing something right. copyright © 2011 business insider.","this fall, microsoft will launch windows 8, a radical redesign from the windows of old"

"-- edgar hernandez didn't expect to learn that he was pre-diabetic at age 16. when his mother burst into tears at the doctor's office, it hit him hard. he was 370 pounds and couldn't stand to look at himself. it was tough being a fat kid, but things became unbearable in high school. edgar was seeing a therapist for depression symptoms. he was frequently bullied in gym class. kids would point at his ""fat wobbling everywhere,"" especially as he struggled to keep up. ""i tried my best to ignore it. but there were times when i just gave in and started crying,"" said edgar, who lives in a suburb of st. louis and is now 18. everyone in his family had a weight problem; his parents developed type 2 diabetes in their forties. but edgar was the biggest. ""he would eat two really big burritos or sandwiches a day, packed with cheese, sour cream, a lot of bread, butter,"" his older brother mario said. ""he would be watching tv, playing video games."" after receiving the sobering blood test result at the doctor's office, edgar went home and cried. and then something new happened: he owned up to his weight problem. ""it was time to stop blaming others for my choices and make a choice to take responsibility,"" he said. he dried his tears, threw on his jacket and began jogging. he only got about half a mile before he stopped and threw up. that was a year and a half ago. edgar, who is 5-foot-9, went on to drop nearly 200 pounds. he now weighs 185 pounds. he has traded his double-xl shirts and size 48 pants for medium t-shirts and 33-inch pants. it happened slowly at first. after that gut-impulse jog in november 2012, edgar started walking before or after school. as he could, he added distance until he was walking about two miles a day. he started to incorporate running intervals until, months later, he could run a full mile. the weight began to come off, but the teen wasn't seeing as much progress as he had hoped. it was his older brother, mario, who helped him kick the weight loss into high gear. mario, who carried 235 pounds on his 5-foot-7 frame, was inspired by edgar's will to change. he took edgar to the grocery store and together they overhauled the family's pantry. chicken breasts and fresh produce replaced the processed foods and sodas that were once the staple at home, mario said. edgar's typical breakfast became a peanut butter sandwich with honey and banana slices. dinners usually featured a chicken breast with two cups of broccoli. he didn't have a specific diet or calorie count; it was all about portion sizes, the teen said. the brothers became each other's support. they started running together in january 2013, buying sweatpants and thermal gear to keep them warm in the illinois weather. mario has lost 70 pounds and continues to run alongside his brother, edgar said. the brothers, who live at home with their parents, have seen their weight loss inspire some changes for the whole family, mario said. the family has cut down on eating out -- once every couple of weeks, as opposed to four to five times a week. ""as a family, we go outside more, walk a little more. it shows because we have a lot more energy,"" mario said. ""even though other members haven't lost as much weight, maybe five pounds, you can see it in their faces."" these days, edgar can't get enough of running. his favorite activities are heavy cardio and weightlifting. the teen even ran his first half-marathon in april, and he's planning another one soon. ""running is what made me feel happy; i had gotten what they call 'runner's high' and now running has become a lifestyle,"" he said. edgar has also found his calling in his new healthy lifestyle. he will start college at southern illinois university-edwardsville in the fall and plans to study exercise science. for mario, watching his little brother shed the pounds at such a young age has been a source of pride. ""if you would have told me three years ago that he'd be running a half-marathon, i wouldn't believe you,"" mario said. ""you see a completely different person that's a lot happier, has more energy and is more active."" edgar couldn't agree more. ""i wouldn't even step out my door to get the mail before,"" he said. ""people don't see the dark, sad side of me anymore. they see a bright, happy kid."" for the people out there looking to lose weight, the teenager has the following advice: don't put it off. if you say you're going to run, do it today, not tomorrow.

""we just want (him) to come home, i think one year is enough. if you want to punish us, if you want to punish amir, for whatever reason he is there, just one year is enough. please let him come home,"" his mother added. with reluctance and much apprehension, the hekmati family opened their home to cnn and sat down for an exclusive interview, their first since hekmati was arrested on august 29, 2011. ""the struggle is the lack of communication,"" said sarah hekmati, amir's sister, ""going from talking to someone daily, weekly, and visiting on holidays to absolutely nothing and not knowing what's going on."" amir hekmati, 29, was born in arizona, and was raised in nebraska and michigan. his family described him as an all-american guy with a yearning to travel and a love of languages. they said he is an outgoing, athletic individual who joined the military to help his family financially and a man who is proud of his service in iraq. mother of accused u.s. spy says iranian charges are false his family says he wanted to learn more about his culture and heritage. this was his first trip to iran and he was looking forward to visiting with relatives, especially the maternal grandmother who helped raise him. but after two weeks in iran, hekmati was arrested, and his family says he was not charged with anything for months. but in december of last year amir's parents say they were shocked to see a video broadcast on iranian tv showing their son confessing to espionage. in the edited and highly produced video, hekmati utters his name in english speaks in farsi describing his work as a u.s. marine and seeming to confirm the allegations of the iranian government that he was an iranian-american working as a cia agent. ""they forced him to do that. that's not true,"" said hekmati's mother, referring to the alleged confession. ""they knew he was a military (soldier) because he told the embassy of iran he was in the military,"" she adds, explaining that her son checked with iranian authorities in the united states before making the trip. ""he's not a spy, he's not working for the cia, we know that, we are sure, absolutely,"" behnaz hekmati said. the u.s. state department also denies hekmati was spying for the u.s. government and calls this case a gross miscarriage of justice. ""we never thought he should have been arrested. we've been trying, because he's a dual u.s.-iranian national, we've been trying to get access to him since he was originally locked up,"" said state department spokesperson victoria nuland. ""the iranians have never allowed us to go to see him."" amir's mother has traveled to iran three times and has been granted limited visits. she described her son as disheartened and completely confused as to why he was arrested. ""he is skinny, pale, like a chalk, his face was like chalk. hair was shaved, had a beard, he walked like this and the feet was together he walked like a robot,"" she said. ""he couldn't stop crying and he was (saying) 'i don't know why i'm here,' mom."" the hekmatis say their son now has a government- approved lawyer in iran although contact with him has been sporadic. a lower court in iran sentenced hekmati to death in january, but the nation's supreme court annulled that sentence less than two months later and ordered a retrial. the lower court previously had convicted hekmati of ""working for an enemy country,"" as well as membership in the central intelligence agency. the hekmatis now believe their son will be granted a retrial, but no date has been set and the family says they have very little information about the legal process. for amir's twin sister, leila, the worry and the waiting have been all too overwhelming. she read from a card he wrote her on their joint birthday last year, before he went to iran: ""'(t)ime has passed but one thing hasn't changed and that's the bond i share with my twin sister. i will never be alone no matter where i am.' ""at night i just think about him; i feel so helpless. i feel like i can't do anything. just please, bring him home,"" she pleaded, hoping iranian leaders will hear her. ali hekmati, amir's father, said he believes the best chance they have of bringing amir home soon is appealing to the iranian leaders directly. ""it's going to take some cooperation from iranian leaders,"" he said.

""i think clients have this perception that black girls do not sell products, which goes way back to the 50's. i think it's engrained in every magazine editor. there are more products for blonde and blue-eyed girls. everything is geared to that."" white has only 13 black models on her books, out of the 300 or so girls she manages. she says the bar is set much higher for black models and they have to be flawless to get booked, so she cannot afford to take them on.

""i would love to be booked for shows ... because i am me - for my personality, for the person, for the model i am and not because i will be the only black girl for the show."" this tokenistic attitude towards diversity is something campbell, iman and hardison are trying to tackle. but designers complain that they don't have enough good black models to choose from.

"-- more than a month after somali militants from al-shabaab massacred 67 people at a mall in nairobi, a kenyan rapid response team has now been deployed to the northeastern border of the country to secure the closed border crossing into neighboring somalia. but official border crossings are far from the only routes into somalia. branching brazenly off from government roads are panya routes or ""rat routes"" -- paths hacked out of the undergrowth that are used by smugglers to cross back and forth between kenya and somalia undetected. they're certainly a smoother ride than the official roads -- and in spite of the kenyan government's efforts to beef up border security after the westgate mall attack, we see no government presence as we cruise down the trail. traveling on these smugglers' routes, we've managed to enter somalia from kenya without showing any id, without going through any checkpoints, and without going through any kind of a security process. nighttime is rush hour on the panya routes. people and goods are ferried back and forth, but everyone is too afraid to stop for long here, even to help the stranded families we see along the way. many are escaping the uncertainty back home in somalia, but some are seeking to enter kenya undetected for other reasons. the panya routes end in kenya at the world's largest refugee camp. somali refugees have long fled to the dadaab camp, and it is currently the target of the kenyan government's post-westgate ire. hiding among refugees authorities believe that during the build-up to the westgate siege, al-shabaab operatives traveled from somalia through the panya routes and hid among the refugees in the camp in northeast kenya. it's from there, kenyan authorities say, that the operatives, hiding in plain sight, made their way through government checkpoints with other undocumented migrants and then deeper into kenya. my colleague and i board one of the many buses carrying people from dadaab to nairobi and ask the conductor how much the fare is. two tickets cost about $12, but the price skyrockets when we tell him we don't have legal documentation to be in kenya. the conductor says $230 will buy us the use of fake kenyan ids and a safe trip. we don't need the ids, but others on the bus do. ""don't worry,"" he says. ""you're not alone."" we count out the cash and he hands us ids from a stash he's been handing out on the bus. that's all it takes. as we arrive at garissa, the main town in eastern kenya, passengers line up at the checkpoint. security officers scrutinize thumbprints with the help of a magnifying glass, comparing them against the fake ids. we overhear one woman take a police officer aside and tell him bluntly she that doesn't have valid papers. everyone, including the woman, is waved back on to the bus and on their way to the country's capital. i show my official documentation -- not the fake ids we purchased -- and join them. vetting challenges kenyan interior minister ole lenku acknowledges the challenge posed by police officers who willfully ignore obviously fake ids for migrants, and says his department is committed to stamping out the problem. a new vetting process will remove corrupt officials from the system, according to lenku. he says: ""people are noticing that there's a new requirement for service in terms of integrity and that those who will not meet that threshold will not be allowed into their service. ""the kenya-somali border is roughly 780 kilometers -- that's a very long border. it is a major security concern for us because the points of entry are far too many but definitely as a country we, with our defense forces in somalia, one of the areas that they're supposed to look after is to take care of that border. what we are working on is a surveillance system using technology that will be able to show us what is happening in the entire borderline."" repatriation deal in the meantime, the kenyan government has signed a voluntary repatriation agreement with somalia and the u.n. that will provide support for somalis who wish to return to their country. the goal is to reduce numbers at the dadaab refugee camp, where kenyan officials believe some security threats may originate. lenku says: ""remember, the process is voluntary, but again the united nation high commission for refugees has confirmed that the areas [in somalia] these people are relocating back to are safe. ""it's a win-win, taking away the heavy burden that came in terms of our security because criminals unfortunately have taken advantage of that hospitality to carry [out] criminal activities not only in the camps but to plan for them in the country."" but as long as the traffic continues to flow across the many rat routes on the border -- and when a fake identity is only one simple transaction away -- will repatriating a few somali refugees be enough to protect kenya?

"-- amelie mauresmo wants a second life -- one away from tennis. after calling time on an illustrious playing career with two grand slams safely tucked away, the frenchwoman is arguably just as entrenched in the game as she ever was. mauresmo is currently juggling roles as tournament director in paris and captain of france's fed cup team, alongside coaching and commentating stints. but the 34-year knows there will come a time when she walks away from the court once and for all, hopefully in the direction of her own vineyard. ""to be lucky enough to have lived one passion -- tennis -- is great but to learn many things and meet new people in a completely different area, atmosphere and world, why not?"" she tells cnn's open court show. ""i have a high passion that is wine; i am a wine lover, i have a big wine cellar. ""i read a lot of things about wine from around the world and different regions in france. i check sometimes with friends of mine about the wine chateaus that are for sale."" a world away from the tranquil vines associated with france's verdant valleys is the slog of the professional tennis circuit -- mauresmo's home for well over a decade. as well as clinching those two major championships in 2006 -- the australian open and wimbledon crowns -- she attained the coveted world no. 1 spot on several occasions and won a silver medal the 2004 olympics. but when injuries began to mount in 2009 and mauresmo took the decision to quit the court, a whole new world presented itself to her. ""it was the pressure,"" she explains. ""the pressure that came out of my shoulders was huge. i was finally able to live a normal life, let's say, to enjoy the things that i could not enjoy before. ""i also felt that i achieved as a tennis player everything that i could have done, so i think it made it quite easy for me to take the step out of it and to do other things. ""honestly i was scared. (i thought) 'what am i going to do? is it going to be exciting enough? how exactly is it going to be?' ""you are going into something and you have no clue what it is ... and i am really happy, i don't regret anything."" fast forward five years and mauresmo is still intrinsically linked with tennis. in 2011 she was named tournament director of the gdf suez open in paris, a competition she won three times as a player, before accepting the role of captain of france's national women's team in july 2012. mauresmo has a special place in her heart for the fed cup -- the female equivalent of the davis cup -- having won it in 2003, triumphing in all eight of her singles rubbers. alize cornet, one of those involved in france's group ii win over switzerland last month, says mauresmo is the best captain she has ever played for. she has also had success in her short coaching career, helping propel marion bartoli to the 2013 wimbledon title before her compatriot's shock decision to quit the sport. with 25 career singles titles to her name, and over $15 million accrued in prize money, mauresmo's name was, and still is, indelibly marked into the fabric of the women's game. ""tennis was all my life for 20 years,"" she says. ""i owe so much to tennis as a person also because i really grew up and learned many things, i was talking earlier about the relationships with people and the strong connections that you get. ""i love that also to go on this journey but not alone -- really having people next to me, beside me, guiding me, learning from them, listening to them and giving them some things -- the exchange and the connection you have is quite interesting. ""and on the sports side you develop the competitiveness that you have inside of you, you really let it out. it's an obsessive thing to be a professional athlete, it's something you think about all the time. ""it's everything you do, how you eat, how you sleep, what time you go to bed, the activities you do outside. it's all related with your tennis and it's something that is really taking all your life, and i also enjoyed it. ""it was a relief when it stopped but throughout your career it was really fulfilling you, and it's quite interesting."" given the knowledge and experience she has, tennis will miss mauresmo when she departs. and when she does, what memory from her playing days will she treasure most? ""wimbledon in 2006,"" she replies, recalling a final in which she rallied from a set down to beat justine henin -- who had denied her olympic gold in athens -- and become the first frenchwoman to win the prestigious title since suzanne lenglen in 1925. ""it was really the emotion, the exhilaration the relief, being so proud of what i did,"" mauresmo adds. ""it was a feeling you really keep in yourself, you are not thinking about it every day in your life but it's something that belongs to you and you cherish. ""getting a medal in the olympics is huge, winning the fed cup for my country, being number one in the world also is an amazing achievement, all those things but yes i would put wimbledon on top.""",amelie mauresmo is still immersed in world of tennis four years after retirement

"-- the soma mining disaster is already the deadliest industrial catastrophe in turkey's history. yet turks are unable to grieve for the appalling loss of human life. utter shock and fury are the overriding public sentiments against the brazen lack of humility and sense of responsibility displayed by those in positions of power, both in the government and private sector. but prime minister recep tayyip erdogan's scandalous attempt to justify the death of more than 280 miners by pointing to mining disasters that occurred in france, britain and the united states more than a century ago reveals more than the worldview of a ruthless politician with a skewed sense of chronology. it also exposes turkey for what it has become: a grim 21st-century dickensian dystopia, where a new class of political and business elite grows rich and powerful on the back of cheap labor and expendable lives. the comparison with 19th century europe is hardly superfluous: worker's rights have been systematically weakened and are routinely violated in turkey since the 1980s, to the extent that the country was ""blacklisted"" by the international labor organisation (ilo) in 2008. trade unions, once powerful and influential, have been emasculated and seen their ranks dwindle. over a million subcontracted workers in the public and private sector are without job security, deprived of their right to join unions and participate in collective bargaining. cheap labor and weak regulation make turkey an attractive destination for industrial production and fuel the country's construction sector, which has been driving growth over the past decade. yet they also come with a terrible price tag: the ilo ranked turkey first in europe and third in the world for fatal work accidents in 2012. coal mining is among the deadliest of professions. according to a 2010 report by the turkish think tank tepav, the ratio of deaths to production capacity in turkey was five times the figure for china and 361 times the figure for the u.s., two of the world's leading coal producers. an overwhelming majority of the work related deaths are caused by poor working conditions, inadequate training and a general lack of job security, and are thus preventable. erdogan seems to disagree. ""dying,"" he declared following an explosion that killed 30 workers at a zonguldak mine in 2010, ""is the fate of the miner."" in soma, he casually suggested that accidents were in the nature of this work; they were ""usual things."" as he spoke, his normally animated face remained calm and expressionless, devoid of any visible sign of remorse or empathy. he accepted no responsibility, including for his party's rejection of a parliamentary proposal by the opposition chp only three weeks ago to investigate a string of past accidents and deaths at the very mining facility in soma. it would appear that erdogan views such ""accidents"" as unfortunate but unavoidable side effects of turkey's rise as a regional power under his leadership. after all, no empire is built without the blood and sacrifice of the nation, whose ""will"" he claims to embody and grandeur he seeks to restore. as in britain and france at the turn of the last century, tales of imperial glory constitute a central part of the ruling akp's populist discourse. and in a country that is deeply divided along identity issues, especially along the secular versus religious fault line, such discourse has powerful appeal. but even erdogan cannot sustain his tremendous popularity through nationalist propaganda and perpetuated feelings of social resentment, if he and his aides continue to dismiss the plight of ""his people"" and respond to their ultimate sacrifice with kicks and punches. in this regard, the soma disaster may turn out to be a watershed moment. numerous times in recent years, the government's security apparatus harassed those who were experiencing unspeakable agony for having lost loved ones, some at the state's own hands. the families of those killed in an airstrike near the kurdish village of roboski in december 2011, in the terror attack in reyhanli in may 2013, or during the anti-government protests across the country since last june have been deprived of their right to grieve and forced into a continuous state shock and outrage. but these were mostly poor kurds, alevis or secular turks, who are unlikely to support erdogan's party. in soma, on the other hand, the akp is popular. it carried the town comfortably both in the general election in 2011 and the municipal election held in march this year. and it is here that the akp's headquarters have been ransacked, and the prime minister hackled and called on to resign by furious residents. in huxley's brave new world, ""soma"" was the hallucinogenic substance used by the state to induce a feeling of contentment and happiness among citizens. it remains to be seen whether in erdogan's brave new turkey, soma will have the opposite effect.",karabekir akkoyunlu: disaster exposes turkey as 21st-century dickensian dystopia
"-- one day after syrian rebels accused government forces of a deadly bombing near a hospital in the besieged city of aleppo, opposition groups said another 151 people had been killed in the fighting thursday. the majority of those deaths occurred in the syrian capital of damascus and its suburbs, according to the syrian observatory for human rights, a london-based opposition group. another 34 were killed in aleppo, where some of the heaviest fighting has occurred. the 20-month civil war has claimed more than 42,000 lives, according to the latest tally from the opposition center for documentation of violations in syria. the group counts 3,133 government soldiers among the dead. and the bloodletting has since carried on unabated while also threatening regional stability. on wednesday, 15 people died in the strike on a building next to the dar al-shifa hospital, including two children and a doctor. ralib al-omar, a leader of the yusif al-asma rebel group, said the strike had targeted the hospital and that the dead included two nurses. a doctor was among the dead -- one of 40 people killed in aleppo on wednesday and 113 across the country. dar al-shifa is one of the main sources of medical help for people in syria's commercial hub. in video posted by opposition activists, the blast appeared to have affected the hospital's often-crowded front lobby. amanpour blog: u.s. has no plan for syria protests first broke out against syrian president bashar al-assad in march 2011. al-assad responded by turning the army and police on the demonstrations. the government-owned syrian arab news agency reported a series of clashes between security forces and ""armed terrorist groups,"" while intense fighting near the syrian-turkish border in recent weeks has pitted loyalist syrian forces against the rebel free syrian army. cnn cannot confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within syria. in a sign of a potential escalation of the conflict, turkey asked its nato allies for patriot missiles wednesday to bolster its air defenses against its southern neighbor. a letter to nato included the ""formal request"" that the alliance send ""air defense elements,"" according to a turkish government statement that cited ""the threats and risks posed by the continuing crisis in syria to our national security."" the statement added that the nato council would convene ""shortly"" to consider the matter. nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen said in a twitter post that the request would be considered without delay. israel puts trust in iron dome rasmussen said the letter from turkey requested patriot missiles that would ""contribute to the de-escalation of the crisis along nato's south-eastern border"" and serve as ""a concrete demonstration of alliance solidarity and resolve."" his statement said three nato countries have available patriot missiles -- germany, the netherlands and the united states -- and it would be up to them to decide if they can deploy them and for how long. a nato team will visit turkey next week to survey possible deployment sites for the missiles, rasmussen's statement said. sources told cnn that germany would be the likely source for a deployment. german chancellor angela merkel said wednesday that any decision involving her country would need the approval of parliament. syrian conflict a factor in israeli election in turkey, foreign ministry spokesman selcuk unal said nato forces under the command of the alliance would come to turkey as part of the missile deployment. he noted that nato-supplied patriot missiles previously were deployed in turkey in 1991 and 2003. ""it's not as if they are going to come tomorrow to be deployed,"" unal said, calling the move a precautionary measure that will deter escalation along the syrian border. international and turkish media reported earlier this month that turkey planned to ask nato to station patriot missiles along the border with syria, but prime minister recep tayyip erdogan denied it at the time. turkey has been careful to make clear it plans no offensive action and does not want a war with syria, which shares a more than 500-mile border. turkish president abdullah gul told reporters november 8 that while going to war with syria was ""out of the question,"" precautions were needed against ""ballistic missiles as well as mid-range and near-range missiles."" the u.s.-made patriot missile system -- which became well known during the first gulf war in the early 1990s when it protected american allies against iraqi scud missiles -- works well against short- and medium-range missiles. last month, syrian artillery shells hit the turkish border town of akcakale, killing five turkish citizens. soon after, the turkish parliament approved a resolution that would allow the military to carry out cross-border incursions. since then, turkish forces have retaliated swiftly with artillery after more than a dozen cross-border artillery strikes believed to have been carried out by the syrian military. once-cozy relations between syria and turkey have all but collapsed since the syrian uprising began last year. turkey is officially hosting more than 111,000 syrian refugees, but the turkish government says tens of thousands of unofficial refugees also live in turkish cities and towns near the syrian border. meanwhile, damascus has repeatedly accused its former ally of meddling in internal syrian affairs by funding and arming the syrian opposition, as well as providing sanctuary and medical care to syrian rebels. cnn's susannah palk, gul tuysuz, tom cohen, richard greene and barbara starr contributed to this report.","new: by thursday, another 76 people had been killed in the fighting, opposition groups say"

""can you feel it? can you feel it?"" he asks excitedly. at home with the motor city madman, ted nugent the platinum-selling rocker and national rifle association board member has invited us to his ranch to understand hunting, self-defense and the second amendment right to bear arms from the perspective of law-abiding gun-owners. after setting up targets on a makeshift shooting range, he hands me a semi-automatic rifle, similar to the one used by the gunman at sandy hook elementary to kill 26 people. ar stands for armalite rifle not assault rifle, nugent explains, blaming the shooter, not the gun itself. ""it's not the weapons. the weapons had nothing to do with it. these weapons are in every pickup in texas. people have to get past the hardware,"" says nugent, pointing out that a pheasant shotgun in the wrong hands can be as deadly. talk back: should ted nugent attend sotu? he can't seem to understand why people who disagree with him won't or can't see it that way. he sticks to his message with a rocker's flair for hyperbole and provocation. ""there is no gun violence,"" he says. ""there is only criminal violence and they use an assortment of tools."" he rattles off statistics to support his argument: more people killed by drunken drivers, more people drowned. when i point out that a deranged 20-year-old like the sandy hook shooter is unlikely to round up first-graders and drown them, he quiets down. ""understood,"" he nods. then without missing a beat, nugent picks up the thread of his argument. ""the gun owners of america are causing no problem. leave us alone. let's go after the mentally deranged who are doing all these vicious crimes. let's go after the recidivistic maggots that judges and prosecutors unleash into our neighborhoods."" opinion: obama, stop trying to appease unfair critics as we drive around his ranch in an all-terrain vehicle, nugent stops at various points to restock his feeders as a supplement for the animals that he says breed year-round. i ask whether his opinion on guns would change if someone in his family were killed. not surprisingly, he says ""no,"" calling guns a ""wonderful tool"" for self-defense, competition and sport. nugent is among the harshest critics of president barack obama (""not a hunting buddy""), attorney general eric holder and any lawmaker who would restrict his or any citizen's access to guns. he laughs off as naã¯ve and ridiculous the notion that no one wants to take americans' guns away. he supports background checks for new guns and for licensed gun show dealers but rejects gun registration, gun licensing, private sale background checks and limiting access to any existing firearms, saying people who want to ban access to certain types of weapons know almost nothing about guns. though nugent understands the nation's desire to stop another gun massacre, he says focusing on criminals and those with mental illnesses will have a bigger impact than trying to ban the more than 310 million guns or billions of high capacity magazines that currently exist in north america. as for high capacity magazines, nugent says limiting bullets is counter to the second amendment right to self-defense, ""when i'm being assaulted at my home, i and i alone, by any consideration whatsoever, will determine how many bullets i need to protect my family."" obama still backs new gun ban; top senator less certain cnn senior producer dana garrett contributed to this report. watch erin burnett weekdays 7pm et. for the latest from erin burnett click here.",rock star ted nugent invites cnn to his ranch to discuss second amendment rights
"-- on the surface, montana senator max baucus's proposal to reform the corporate tax code seems politically insane. the powerful chairman of the senate finance committee has proposed tightening up the tax treatment of corporate profits overseas. the senator, along with legislators in both parties, wants to use this proposal as the basis for broader loophole-closing reforms that also tackle the individual tax code. given how difficult it has been to pass any piece of legislation in recent years, it seems impossible that congress will muster the energy or courage to challenge powerful interest groups that benefit from the status quo and to reform the tax code. while loophole-closing tax reform might be good policy, it is hard to see how it can be good politics. ""this is a big rock to push up the hill,"" warned oregon democrat ron wyden. but in fact there is reason to believe that tax reform might have a chance to pass. the proposal comes at a good time. congress is stuck in the mud. as an institution, congress needs a big victory. polls show that the approval ratings of congress have reached all-time lows, now having fallen to an abysmal nine percent. although members of congress tend to focus on their own electoral future, the public image of congress has reached such a low point that the leaders of both parties are seriously concerned. when public disapproval of the institution is so strong, it creates the environment for a possible ""throw the bums"" out atmosphere in which all parties are at risk for an anti-incumbent election. nothing can boost the image of congress as an institution like a reform that benefits the public interest over private interests. although achieving tax reform is extraordinarily difficult, democrats and republicans could walk away from a deal looking as if they were finally willing to take on the status quo in washington and to defy the powerful interest groups who lurk on k street. this might be enough to bolster public attitudes about the house and senate going into the next couple of election cycles. if congress gores enough oxen, with both parties equally implicated in the reform, members could insulate themselves from the falloutâ€”preventing one party from using this as an issue against the other--and strengthen their standing with the electorate as a result. both parties also stand to benefit from tax reform because it remains one of the best ways to raise revenue without raising taxes. one of the reasons that tax reform has always attracted the interest of fiscal conservatives is that cleaning up the tax code of its loopholes quickly raises more revenue. most fiscal conservatives understand that serious deficit reduction is only possible through a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts. although the united states has maintained a progressive tax code since 1913, few upper income individuals or corporations pay the actual higher rates since loopholes diminish their obligations. occasionally, such as in 1969 and 1986, congress has closed loopholes as a way to raise more money to curb the deficit. unlike 1986, this time the legislation would not be revenue neutral. the amount of money raised by closing loopholes would be more than the money saved by taxpayers enjoying lower rates, and that money could be used to help shrink the deficit. that could enable the grand bargain over deficit reduction that democrats and republicans have been unsuccessfully pursuing for years. as occurred when ronald reagan was president in 1986, tax reform was an issue that both parties had an incentive to support. for unpopular republicans, tax reform can offer evidence that the party is committed to fiscal responsibility and demonstrate that they are capable of governance. passage of the legislation would offer a contrast to the image that the party gained when it used the debt ceiling to try to force president obama's hand on spending cuts. for democrats, tax reform can shift the national agenda away from the problems with the roll out of the affordable care act and toward a legislative accomplishment. finally, tax reforms can be one of the first tests of the post-filibuster reform congress. the senate voted to prevent filibusters on executive and judicial nominations. they did so through a majority vote, establishing for the first time that a majority was sufficient to change the rules. many experts predict that this precedent might scare senators from using the filibuster as much as in recent years, fearing that the tool might be eliminated altogether. it is thus possible that tax reform would now only require 51, rather than 60, votes in the senate. president obama could desperately use a victory like tax reform. as the chances for passing immigration reform diminish, and the possibilities of achieving progress on climate change are nil, tax reform might be one of the few areas where progress is possible. ronald reagan scored a big victory in 1986, one that remains a noted part of his record and legacy. unfortunately, over time new loopholes were created and there is a need for another around of reform. the president should seize the moment, to make sure that his second term is not solely defined by the bitter partisan battles over the budget and health care. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of julian zelizer.",julian zelizer: sen. max baucus' proposed to reform taxes isn't as crazy as it sounds

""i am thinking, i am praying about whether i'll run in 2016."" the 43-year-old governor, who has been boosting his profile nationwide partly through his role as vice chairman of the republican governors association, insisted that he would not make a final decision about a 2016 run until after the november midterm elections. ""if i were to decide to run for 2016, it would have nothing to do with polls or fundraising numbers,"" he said. ""it would simply be based on the same calculation that i made when i ran for ... congress or governor. do i think i could make a difference? do i have something unique to offer in terms of my specific ideas or my experiences? is this something that i'm supposed to be doing?"" jindal used his appearance at the monitor breakfast to unveil an energy proposal from his nonprofit group, america next. the plan embraces an ""all of the above"" strategy but stresses the importance of continued development of domestic oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing and other means. oil and gas play a particularly critical role in the louisiana economy. jindal blasted the obama administration's refusal to move forward with the controversial keystone xl pipeline. ""right now, we've got an administration (of) science deniers when it comes to harnessing america's energy resources and potential,"" he said. jindal fielded a wide range of questions from reporters at the breakfast. among other things, he expressed his support for the administration's decision to strengthen u.s. efforts to combat the ebola outbreak in africa. ""i think it is important that we lean forward,"" the governor said. ""we've got certainly both a humanitarian basis as well as vested interest in wanting to help countries in africa that are hardest hit."" asked about efforts to confront isis in the middle east, jindal said congress should back white house proposals to train and arm syrian rebels. but he argued that repeated delays on the part of the administration had allowed the power of islamic extremists to grow unchecked for too long.

""carter believed in american exceptionalism. i don't think obama does,"" he said.

"facebook's decision to file for public status means its no. 2 executive, sheryl sandberg, might be worth as much as $1.6 billion. according to forbes, that would catapult her just below the seemingly untouchable oprah in the ranking of the richest self-made women. she won't have much company: only 7.5% of the major earners at america's fortune 500 companies are female. the many media profiles of sandberg all seem to be asking the same question: how did sheryl do it? how did she get the confidence to perform so well at such a high level? and perform she has. according to the new york times, she took facebook from 70 million users and no business model to profits reaching $1 billion on $3.7 billion in revenue in just four years. sandberg's own mentor, larry summers, ignited a firestorm in 2005 when he wondered publicly whether one reason women weren't achieving at the highest levels in the sciences was a lack of biological aptitude, particularly for math. before long, he was ousted from his position as president of harvard -- not officially for this reason -- and the nation was abuzz about women's lack of parity in so many fields and forums. at that time, about 15% of opinion pieces were written by women, though the imbalance was largely under the radar. the opinion page became a particularly contentious space for an outpouring of women's voices in this overdue conversation. nationally syndicated columnist susan estrich called the los angeles times' leadership out for sexism on its opinion pages. anne applebaum of the washington post argued with estrich and said she resented being called a ""female"" journalist. and maureen dowd of the new york times, echoing one of the most commonly held beliefs about why women don't have parity, wrote that women weren't fairly represented because they are afraid of being attacked and care too much about what others think. they lack confidence. but what does that really mean? the notion that women lack confidence implies a negative judgment. it's viewed as a weakness, coded as feminine. but some recent social science research reveals a more likely and complex explanation: people do things because people who look and talk like them or share the same background do those things. to assume that a lack of confidence is the reason so few women are intellectual leaders is too simplistic. when a woman doesn't go for a big corporate job like sandberg's or says no when television producers call, saying she doesn't have any confidence implies it's an individual choice made in some sort of sociocultural vacuum. as women, in many cases, the impulse to do something out of the norm of our peer group, like write an opinion piece or ask for a promotion, has simply never occurred to us. if it does, we don't act on it. our girlfriends aren't doing it. our female colleagues aren't doing it. why should we? peer influence, whether you're a teenage girl trying to figure out what to wear to junior high on monday morning or a midlevel manager at morgan stanley, is a powerful indicator of what you think is possible for yourself. in ""join the club: how peer pressure can transform the world,"" tina rosenberg writes, ""the social norms set by our peers dominate our choices about what we value and what we expect in life."" sandberg, who often urges women to ""lean into"" their careers, must know that you don't lean in alone. she runs a monthly salon for women out of her home, inviting guest speakers like feminist gloria steinem and trailblazing sen. claire mccaskill. women of various generations gather and shape their ambitions over a meal and some conversation. at the oped project, we cultivate new voices, training minorities and women to inhabit their place as narrators of the world. the challenge is to shift the way we think about ourselves. we must see our peers and ourselves as leaders who have a right and a responsibility to weigh in on the matters of our day. we have to create a new ecosystem in which we see ourselves as part of the critical conversations of our age and feel equally entitled and compelled to narrate them. who hasn't heard a parent quip, ""if all of your friends were jumping off of a cliff, would you?"" there's some profound wisdom in that old cliché: if your friends aren't aiming for high-profile corporate leadership or going head-to-head on the sunday morning talk shows, you're not likely to, either. we can create more sandbergs by surrounding ourselves with confident, outspoken women. follow cnn opinion on twitter. join the conversation on facebook.",writers: facebook's sandberg an anomaly; 7.5% of fortune 500 big earners are female
"-- it has been 17 years since france had a president from the left, but that might be about to change. opinion polls continue to favor francois hollande, a candidate from the center-left socialist party, over center-right incumbent nicolas sarkozy in the upcoming french presidential election. if elected, hollande would be the first left-wing president since francois mitterrand in 1995. sarkozy is seeking his second five-year term, following jacques chirac, who served 12 years in office. as the french take to the polls sunday, here are a few key points to keep in mind: 1. this is a two-horse race, but other candidates matter. while there are actually 10 candidates taking part in the presidential race, spanning the entire political spectrum, polls show that only two candidates -- sarkozy and hollande -- have a realistic chance of winning the french presidency. but it will be important to watch how many votes the other candidates get sunday. that's because those votes will almost certainly be up for grabs in a runoff election two weeks later. in france, a presidential candidate must receive more than 50% of the vote to win office. if no one claims a majority in the first round of voting -- and no one ever has in this current system -- the top two vote-getters advance to a second round of voting. ""the other candidates have to be given some attention because they exert an influence in the race,"" said michael leruth, who teaches a course about the election at the college of william & mary in virginia. ""for example, if (far-left candidate jean-luc) melenchon continues to do well and has even a slightly strong showing, hollande might have to tack more to the left in the runoff round. ""if you're coming out of the first round with 27%, 28%, you need to make it to 50%. so you have to think of where you are going to make up that difference to prevail in the final round."" another candidate to watch is on the far right. marine le pen, daughter of 2002 presidential finalist jean-marie le pen, is polling well behind sarkozy and hollande, but she's still in the double digits with melenchon. a strong showing from her sunday might have an effect on sarkozy's strategy going into the runoff. 2012 a year of elections: return of the left? 2. one issue stands out among the rest. the economy dominates the political agenda in france, much like it does in america. ""basically for months now, the top issues have been unemployment and purchasing power,"" said jim bittermann, cnn's correspondent in paris. jobs have been difficult to come by, especially for young people, and that is one of the main reasons why sarkozy is vulnerable. ""even though some people would give sarkozy high marks for doing the kinds of things that might have a positive long-term effect on the economy -- like raising the retirement age to put the system on sounder fiscal footing -- he hasn't been successful in bringing jobs back,"" leruth said. comparing sarkozy and hollande on their economic policy is not unlike comparing republicans and democrats in the united states. ""hollande is in favor of more government action to stimulate the economy, stimulate spending ... whereas sarkozy wants to improve the climate for business by lowering some taxes, by talking about repealing the law establishing the 35-hour work week -- a socialist measure from the late '90s -- to make it possible to work more,"" leruth said. ""it's more of a private-sector approach."" 3. france and america have more in common than just high unemployment. immigration, race and the assimilation of france's large muslim community have been prominent issues leading up to the election, even before the march shootings by an islamic extremist in toulouse and montauban. sarkozy has been tough on immigration. last year, a law went into effect banning islamic face coverings in public places, the so-called burqa ban. and in a recent television interview, sarkozy said france has ""too many foreigners"" and that the country is not integrating them properly. sarkozy won the 2007 election by taking a strong stance on race, according to political analyst simon persico from the center of european studies. but le pen, this year's far-right candidate, says sarkozy hasn't been strong enough while in office. ""le pen is saying the original is better than the copy, and that voters should not believe sarkozy on race,"" he told cnn. 4. the election's result could affect the eurozone. sarkozy has worked closely with german chancellor angela merkel throughout the european debt crisis, leading the way for strict austerity measures in greece and other troubled countries. would hollande's election encourage a change in strategy? ""there is concern that, within the eurozone, hollande's election could create greater instability,"" leruth said. ""he's talked about renegotiating some of the accords that have been reached -- at the instigation of sarkozy and merkel -- to ensure greater stability in the eurozone."" the reason is long-term growth. ""i think some of the french like the way (sarkozy) handled -- with merkel -- the agreement in december to get more rigor, more austerity into european budgets. but then hollande and other economists are saying we also need growth, and these plans are going to absolutely stifle growth,"" said homer sutton, a french professor at davidson college near charlotte, north carolina. like leruth, he is teaching a course on the election. france's own debt is also a concern. like the united states, the country recently had its aaa credit rating downgraded. hollande has promised to create tens of thousands of public-sector jobs and raise taxes on the rich to pay for it. but some are concerned that might encourage the rich to just leave france. ""there's some feeling that if hollande is elected, the attack on the french sovereign debt could be quite serious,"" sutton said. ""and this is what sarkozy has been saying: 'if you elect hollande, we're going to be losing more than our aaa. we'll be going down even further.' "" 5. franco-american relations should remain strong. hollande has pledged to remove french troops from afghanistan by the end of this year if he is elected. whether it's a realistic goal or not, that could create some tension between paris and washington. but hollande is known for being a no-nonsense pragmatist. ""hollande knows that he needs the united states and that the united states needs europe, so i think there would be a great deal of cooperation there,"" sutton said. sutton recalled mitterrand's election in 1981 and how there were initial concerns about him. ""everyone said, 'oh, he's got four communists in his government, this is going to be the end of the relationship with the united states.' but it turns out that he was a very strong defender of american missiles in germany, for example,"" sutton said. ""mitterrand's friendship with (chancellor) helmut kohl, it was a strong french-german relationship, and (u.s. president ronald) reagan and mitterrand didn't get along too badly despite their ideological differences.""","france's presidential election begins sunday, to be followed by a runoff in two weeks"

"-- few people in the world have the chance to see a former pet orangutan released back into the wild and it was about to happen right in front of me. we were with the frankfurt zoological society orangutan team deep in the sumatran jungle at the site where bobo the endangered sumatran orangutan was to be released. i was standing with the cnn team about 10 feet from the orangutan's crate, watching in anticipation as an indonesian man was standing on top about to open it. he lifted one wall of the crate and bobo slowly walked out. the orangutan was very calm as he exited the crate. the first thing he did was look over to where we were standing. that also happened to be the direction where our tech expert john had placed our gopro camera just a few feet away. it was an incredible sight and a great shot. read more: 'we knew this was going to be a trip like no other' i was actually a bit nervous seeing bobo look at us. fzs indonesia director peter pratje warned us not to get too close to the 11-year-old male orangutan. sumatran orangutans can be very strong and unpredictable. we had no idea what to expect. did we make him feel threatened? would he charge a group of onlookers with cameras? luckily for us, the answer was no. he turned away from us and walked into the jungle. the islands of sumatra and borneo are the only two places on earth where wild orangutans roam free. it's illegal to have one as a pet because it's an endangered species, but they're sold on the black market for thousands of dollars. pet orangutans are hunted and captured as very small babies from remote areas of the rainforest. it's a brutal process. mother orangutans often fight to protect their babies, like any mother would, so the mother is often killed in the process. it's a cruel way to get a cute pet for only a few years. most orangutans are too much for people to handle as they grow into adolescence, so the owners seldom keep their pets. that's exactly what happened to bobo. he was five years old when his owner gave him up. bobo was then brought to peter pratje and his team at the frankfurt zoological society. read more: why you should care about the sumatran rainforest when the fzs obtains a former pet orangutan like bobo, the only life these animals have ever known is captivity. so the fzs team has to erase all the captive behavior the orangutan learned as a pet and replace it with wild orangutan behavior. it takes many years to individually model this behavior to these orangutans to replicate the lessons that a mother orangutan would've taught her baby. each orangutan has to learn everything from finding food to climbing a tree. climbing is very important for sumatran orangutans. they share the same habitat as sumatran tigers, so to keep from becoming a tiger's dinner, orangutans must live most of their lives in trees. after bobo left his crate, he was supposed to climb the tree in front of him to a platform peter and his team had constructed. but he didn't. frustratingly, bobo wasn't using his training. he remained on the ground, walking around, as we followed him for more than half an hour. read more: orangutans stressed by eco-tourists after a release, members of the fzs orangutan team usually follow the newly wild orangutan for several weeks during the day for until they're sure the orangutan can survive on its own. several members of the team were following bobo that day trying to coax him into the trees with fruit. nothing worked. minutes ticked by. finally, peter theorized that bobo was staying on the ground because there were so many people around him walking on the ground. bobo has been modeling the behavior of human trainers for years, so maybe he wanted to be like us and stay on the ground. we didn't want to hurt bobo's chances of survival, so we decided to leave him and the fzs trackers to go about their day. it was too early to tell how bobo will be able to survive in the rainforest by himself. we would have to wait and get an update from peter later. walking back to the camp, we were all feeling a sense of awe and hope for the future of sumatran orangutans and for endangered species worldwide. if this species can be brought back from the brink of extinction, could this be a model for other species?","jenni watts produced expedition: sumatra, cnn's new environment special"

""there were just a few big wineries and my father had to sell his grapes to them."" trajkov told cnn. ""but my grandfather had his own winery before socialism and that inspired me. ""from an early age i had worked on my father's vineyard, but i had never had the opportunity to make my own wine."" trajkov, now 41, worked in banking for seven years in macedonia, london and new york. he was studying for an mba in phoenix, arizona, when he took the holiday in napa valley that was to change his career. trajkov returned to macedonia and in 2003 bought some land close to where he had grown up. he planted his first grapes in 2005 and began selling wine from his popova kula winery the following year. ""bringing together the concept of wine tourism with grape growing and wine making was fascinating for me,"" trajkov told cnn. popova kula produces 23 varieties of wine, but trajkov's favorites are those native to macedonia. he is keen to give a future to the ancient vines denied when macedonia was part of yugoslavia. then, production was all about bulk export of more common grapes, such as cabernets and sauvignons. alongside his better-known grapes, trajkov produces vranec and stanushina, and has won international medals for several of his wines. ""i describe our philosophy as 'glocalization', promoting the local varieties globally. we are really traditionalists. we think that there are some wonderful domestic varieties."" trajkov put all his own money into the winery, and his father sold his own nearby vineyards to invest too. trajkov's former career as a banker has helped, and he became the first macedonian company to be floated on its stock exchange. ""i knew how to do that because of my background. we have strong equity,"" he said. ""i cannot say our sales are as we originally predicted in our business plan, but i can say we hope to get there because our sales are increasing year to year. that's because we have highest quality wine."" to increase sales further, trajkov knows he must work hard on promoting his wines more widely. he has even built a hotel to accommodate tourists, with each room themed on a wine. alongside the hiking, bird-watching, fishing and skiing on offer locally, the napa valley influence becomes clear. catriona davies contributed to this report",a visit to napa valley inspired jordan trajkov to start a winery in macedonia

""for example, in the second half of last year, spanish regulators asked us to remove 270 search results that linked to blogs and articles in newspapers referencing individuals and public figures, including mayors and public prosecutors. in poland, we received a request from a public institution to remove links to a site that criticized it. we didn't comply with either of these requests."" in the last half of 2011, u.s. agencies asked google to remove 6,192 individual pieces of content from its search results, blog posts or archives of online videos, according to the report. that's up 718% compared with the 757 such items that u.s. agencies asked google to remove in the six months prior. overall, google received 187 requests from united states law enforcement agencies and courts to remove content from its web properties from july to december, up 103% from the 92 requests the mountain view, california, company received in the previous reporting period. in one incident cited in the report, a u.s. law enforcement agency asked google to take down a blog that ""allegedly defamed a law enforcement official in a personal capacity."" the company did not comply with that request. in another, a separate law enforcement group asked google to take down 1,400 youtube videos (google owns youtube) because of ""alleged harassment."" and in canada, the passport office asked google to delete a youtube video ""of a canadian citizen urinating on his passport and flushing it down the toilet,"" according to the report. the tech company did not oblige either of those requests but did comply at least in part with 42% of the removal requests from the united states in the last half of 2011, the report says. that number is down considerably compared to previous reports; in the latter half of 2010, for example, google said it complied with 87% of u.s. requests to remove content. the biannual transparency report, which includes data to july 2009, also indicates a rise in world governments' requests to take a look at the data google collects about its users. and with those requests, google tended to be much more likely to comply. in the last half of 2011, google received 6,321 requests for user data from government agencies in the united states and complied at least in part with 93% of them, according to data released in the report. those requests for information about google users come as part of criminal investigations, google says, and are not unique to the company. google complied more frequently with u.s.-based requests for information about users than with requests from other countries, according to the report. it complied or partially complied with only 24% of such requests from canada, 44% from france and 64% from the united kingdom, for example. the number of user data requests google received from the united states was up 6% over the previous six-month period and 37% compared with the last half of 2010. google says this increase ""isn't surprising, since each year we offer more products and services, and we have a larger number of users."" in the report, the company adds: ""we review each request to make sure that it complies with both the spirit and the letter of the law, and we may refuse to produce information or try to narrow the request in some cases."" writing at forbes.com, tech columnist andy greenberg says that google ""should be applauded for taking a strong stand against censorship"" but that ""the government's increasingly sticky fingers in google's databases comes at a sensitive time.""

"citing cost concerns, the obama administration said friday it has halted a long-term care insurance program that was part of the massive health care law passed in 2010. called the class act (community living assistance services and supports), the program was canceled by health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius after a 19-month effort to find a way to make it financially viable. in a letter to congress, sebelius wrote, ""despite our best analytical efforts, i do not see a viable path forward for class implementation at this time."" the class program was similar to long-term care plans available in the private sector in which workers sign up and pay a monthly premium. it was voluntary and was to be paid for entirely by the premiums from those who signed up. in return, subscribers would get a daily benefit. but a senior administration official told cnn that there were big questions whether class could be self-sustaining even when the health care reform law was being considered by congress. and as a result, lawmakers specified that the hhs secretary had to determine that the program would be sustainable for 75 years before certifying it. the legislation had been championed by the late sen. edward kennedy, d-massachusetts. in a blog entry on healthcare.gov, sebelius cited warnings that not enough young healthy people would sign up. ""this could have led to a vicious cycle where premiums would have to be set higher and higher to cover the likely costs of benefits, leading fewer and fewer healthier people to sign up for the program,"" she wrote. sebelius said she wasn't giving up. ""so even as we suspend work on implementing class, we are recommitting ourselves to the ultimate goal of making sure americans can get the long-term care they need, whether it's a working-age mom with disabilities who needs daily support right now or a young man at his first job who wants to protect himself and his family against the possibility of huge long-term care costs in the future,"" sebelius wrote. congressional republicans had long targeted the program as part of their effort to repeal president barack obama's health care reform law. responding to the sebelius decision, senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said in a statement, ""the obama administration today acknowledged what they refused to admit when they passed their partisan health bill: the class act was a budget gimmick that might enhance the numbers on a washington bureaucrat's spreadsheet but was destined to fail in the real world."" mcconnell said the class act ""is only one of the unwise, unsustainable components of an unwise, unsustainable law.""

"-- they'd gone to w. scott harrington's dentist office in a tulsa, oklahoma, suburb to have a wisdom tooth pulled or perhaps have their jaw realigned. on saturday, scores of his patients were waiting to be checked once again -- this time not to replace missing teeth, say, but to find out whether they'd been exposed to hepatitis or hiv. by 3 p.m. local time saturday, one hour later than planned, some 420 people -- out of 7,000 of harrington's patients from the past six years who health authorities reached out to -- had been screened for hepatitis b, hepatitis c and hiv at the tulsa health department. they came after investigators discovered unsanitary, unprofessional conditions at harrington's office in owasso, 14 miles northeast of tulsa, that one official said created a ""perfect storm"" for infections. within two weeks, those tested saturday (and when the screenings resume starting monday) should get the results back -- all because they'd gone to see an oral surgeon with 35 years of experience. ""how do you say you're sorry to 7,000 people that you could possibly have infected?"" said melissa wood, whose daughter -- a patient of harrington's -- spent part of her 18th birthday getting tested. harrington, 64, surrendered his dental license on march 20 after health investigators found sterilization, staffing and other infractions. ""i will tell you that when ... we left, we were just physically kind of sick,"" susan rogers, executive director of the oklahoma board of dentistry, said earlier this week. ""that's how bad it was, and i've seen a lot of bad stuff over the years."" the dentistry board launched its probe after one of harrington's patients came down with hepatitis c. that patient originally tested positive for hiv, too, but a subsequent test came back negative, the tulsa health department said. while other states conduct random inspections of dentist offices with some regularity, rogers told the tulsa world newspaper that dentists' offices in oklahoma are inspected only after a complaint is filed. 5 things to check at the dentist's office investigators raised a number of sterilization and ""cross-contamination"" alarms -- such as ""unauthorized, unlicensed"" employees using ivs to sedate patients and that needles weren't handled properly. the outward cleanliness of the office belied the mess elsewhere, rogers said, noting that ""just basic universal precautions for blood-borne pathogens"" weren't followed. besides being ""unlocked and unattended,"" the drug cabinet was rife with issues -- containing, for example, a drug that expired in 1993 -- according to the official complaint filed before the state dental board. other records showed that morphine had been used in patients throughout 2012, even though the dentist had not received a morphine delivery since 2009. harrington and his attorney have not returned multiple calls from cnn. and the oral surgeon wasn't home when a cnn crew went there on saturday. ""he seems highly competent to me, just a smart guy,"" said frank dale, one of harrington's neighbors. ""i was just shocked when i heard it. and i feel badly for him. i feel badly for his patients."" a teenage patient, who asked not to be named, told cnn he had a bad experience at harrington's office a year ago. during a surgery to remove three molars, he awoke momentarily to see profuse bleeding. he said he became alarmed but was told to ""shut up"" and hold gauze in place. when he awoke a second time, he was tied up on the floor. harrington's staff explained that he had been ""combative"" during the operation, he said. dentist's office a 'perfect storm' for hiv, hepatitis exposure ""i felt when i got out of there and went through all i went through, i felt they didn't know much of what they were doing at all,"" he said. wood's teenage daughter, marissa, said she finds it ""horrifying"" that her june 2011 visit to get her wisdom teeth extracted may have put her at risk for hiv or hepatitis. she remembered thinking of harrington as a ""really nice guy"" -- but that was then. ""i'm angry,"" she said. ""i feel like he's ... let us down. i feel like he's let a lot of people down."" the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention provides national guidelines for dental offices to help prevent the spread of infections. they include cleaning and sterilizing all nondisposable items such as dental tools between patients, disinfecting surfaces and requiring staff members to wear protective masks, gloves and eye wear. since 1991, only three cases of dental infection in patients have been documented -- two with hepatitis b and one with hiv, according to the cdc. no cases of hepatitis c have been reported. ""this is exceedingly rare,"" said dr. matt messina, a consumer adviser and spokesman for the american dental association, of the allegations levied against harrington. ""i'm just angry, because this is a case, i think, so far outside of the bounds of normal that it makes it remarkable."" the infection risks are compounded given that harrington told investigators he had a higher-than-normal population proportionally of hiv and hepatitis patients, rogers said. hiv is a condition that over time destroys a body's immune system, thus its ability to fight infections. if not treated, nearly all those infected with hiv will develop aids, according to the national institutes of health. hepatitis -- the most common types being hepatitis a, b and c -- refers to inflammation or viral infections of one's liver. some 4.4 million americans have chronic hepatitis, though most of them don't know it, the cdc says. oklahoma dentist let unlicensed staffers give ivs, state official says cnn's greg botelho and mariano castillo contributed to this report.","new: 420 people are tested for hepatitis b, hepatitis c and hiv, health department says"
"-- it's the weekend. it's the world cup. it's brazil. that makes three good, maybe even great, reasons to party. and rest assured, there will be plenty of revelry saturday in the land of samba. there always is, on any day. but that does not mean that harsh realities won't intervene -- perhaps related to protests, stadium problems or other issues that dogged the world cup in the weeks leading up to football's biggest tournament. here's a look at five things to look out for saturday, both on and off the field. two european football stalwarts face off after one game thursday and three on friday, saturday will be the first day with four world cup. while all offer intrigue in their own way, from a sports perspective, one stands out: england and italy. one of them, england, claims to have invented the sport though it can only claim one world cup title, from 1966. italy, on the other hand, won the most recent of its four championships in 2006. history aside, there's no clear favorite in saturday's contest. italy and england are about as evenly matched as they come, heading into the tournament ninth and tenth respectively in the fifa world rankings. spotlight on stadium construction but the story for the england-italy tilt isn't just that they're playing, but where they are playing: in manaus. that's probably not the first place you think of, when you think of brazil. the capital of the amazonas state, it is more than 1,700 miles from rio de janeiro. and critics have latched on to construction of a stadium in this relatively remote locale not just for its cost, but they also question its usefulness and point out potential danger. to the latter point, a man identified as marcleudo de melo ferreira fell 35 meters to his death while working to build the stadium. stadium construction worker dies his was the fifth death, nationwide, involved in the construction of world cup venues. there are also concerns that playing games in the thick of the tropics might put players' health at risk, once the games begin. the forecast saturday in manaus calls for high temperatures in high 80s. but -- even if it is in the rain forest -- there's not expected to be rain to cool things down. where not to find lush grass? the amazon still, the game will go on saturday at the arena da amazonia -- that being the official name for the manaus stadium. does that mean the stadium is ready for the spotlight? not necessarily. the british newspaper, the guardian, reports that power cables hang from walls in locker rooms and that workers very recently put on a final coat of asphalt. but the main focus, and concern, is about where all the action will take place on the field. pictures posted online showed a spotty patchwork of grass, looking dry and bare in spots despite it being set in one of the lushest regions in the world. numerous reports -- and more photos -- indicate the grounds crew have been spraying the field green, to make the pitch look better. white spray and goal-line technology the funny thing is that having people spray the grass in the middle of a world cup arena was supposed to be one of the biggest and best changes tied to the 2014 tournament. watch saturday to see yourself: referees now carry around a white spray they can use to mark, say, a line 10 yards from a free kick spot. it stays visible long enough to prevent players from creeping up, then vanishes soon after that. vanishing spray makes world cup debut that's not the only notable development in this year's world cup. those who watched friday's chile-australia contest saw the debut of a new system designed to track whether a ball crosses the goal line or not. the system of cameras and sensors can follow the ball at a rate of up to 500 images per second and instantly alert a referee when it crosses the line. technology aims to get rid of 'ghost goals' every team has a story saturday's three other games, and six other teams besides england and italy, have plenty of their own story lines as well. for greece, led by 34-year-old club journeyman theofanis gekas, it's about whether it can surge, as it did in winning the prestigious 2004 euro tournament? for colombia, will goalkeeper faryd mondragon get on the field in his fifth world cup to become the oldest player in tournament history? (he turns 43 later this month.) for japan, can it represent asia well -- as one of the continent's most well-respected teams -- by overcoming cote d'ivoire, or the ivory coast, in a nighttime contest in recife? for ivory coast, can the 6-foot-3 yaya toure -- who scored 20 goals in manchester city's championship premier league season -- make an argument that he's one of the world's best attacking midfielders? for costa rica, which cruised through qualifying -- including handing the united states its biggest drubbing -- surprise the skeptics and make its way through a packed group d? and can uruguay successfully kick off its quest to go two-for-two in world cups in brazil, having defeated the south american superpower the last time the tourney was held here, in 1950? stay tuned.","there will be four world cup games, in four locations, on saturday"

"-- the political turmoil in egypt and tunisia has european tour operators scrambling to divert package tours to more stable destinations, and several thousand tourists have already been re-routed to beaches in spain, a spanish tourism industry official told cnn. ""we can't be happy about unfortunate circumstances elsewhere,"" said rafael gallego nadal, president of the spanish federation of travel agency associations. ""but the increase (in tourists) has arrived at an important moment"" as spain recovers from a deep economic slump. in addition to the few thousand extra british, german and scandinavian holidaymakers who've already arrived in spain's canary islands, predictions are there could be tens of thousands of additional vacationers by may, gallego said. for now, the seven-island canaries archipelago, located in the atlantic ocean just west of morocco, is the only part of spain that can compete directly with egypt and tunisia for the beach vacation business in winter. but if the political uncertainty continues in north africa into the spring and summer, the package tours diverted from those destinations to spain's mediterranean coast and islands could involve hundreds of thousands of additional tourists this year, gallego said. tunisia's beaches have been a prime destination for french tourists, gallego said, and some of them could be diverted to spain's coasts by next summer as well. russian and eastern european tourists who had holiday tours set for egypt or tunisia may instead go in greater numbers to turkey, gallego said, based on information that he said is making the rounds among tour operators and travel agencies. egypt had nearly 12 million international tourist arrivals in 2009, compared with nearly 7 million for tunisia, and 52 million for spain, which is among the world's top four tourist destinations, along with france, the united states and china, the united nations world tourism organization reports. spain's canary islands had 11 million tourists, including foreigners and spaniards, in 2010, a three percent increase over 2009. the extra tourists now diverted from egypt and tunisia are helping the canaries to recover, said gallego, who is based in las palmas on the gran canaria island. but diverting package tours from north africa to spain or other locations is not always an instant maneuver. a package tour in the canary islands costs about 30 percent more than a similar beach holiday in egypt or tunisia, gallego said. so hard-fought negotiations over prices have ensued, in which the spanish hotel operators may agree to a lower price which still turns out to be more than the tour operator and individual tourist were going to pay in egypt or tunisia, gallego said.",spain is one of the top four tourist destinations
"-- two iranians detained for years in iraq by u.s. troops have been freed and are headed home, officials at the iranian embassy in baghdad told cnn on friday. the release comes as the mothers of three imprisoned american hikers visit their incarcerated children in iran. the mothers have been imploring the iranian regime to release them. but iranian officials said the release of the two in iraq has no connection to the status of the three hikers. hikers' moms meet relatives of once-detained iranians ahmed barazandeh was arrested six years ago by u.s. troops in the iraqi city of samarra. he had been traveling from najaf to samarra on a religious pilgrimage and was detained after he separated from his group. the second man -- identified by officials at iran's baghdad embassy as abdullah maleki and by iran's press tv as ali abdulmalek -- was arrested by u.s. troops more than two years ago because he was not carrying a passport when he entered iraq. the u.s. military in iraq issued a statement saying that a detainee named ahmad barazandeh had been transferred to iraqi control in june 2009 and another named ali abdolmaleki had been transferred in october 2009. barazandeh was captured in march of 2004 and abdolmaliki in november of 2007, it said. hassan kazemi qomi, iran's ambassador to iraq, is quoted by press tv as saying the abductees were arrested on ""baseless charges and (for) not carrying passports."" the ambassador said both men were on a pilgrimage to iraqi holy cities when they were seized. the iraqi government secured their release from a prison controlled by u.s. forces within the framework of a security agreement signed between baghdad and washington in 2008. the move could be significant because iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad publicly called for a swap when asked in a newspaper interview in may about the possible release of the hikers. last week, a french woman arrested in iran on espionage charges was released and an iranian who had been in a french prison for 19 years was freed. but it is not known whether that was a swap.",release comes as 3 mothers seek freedom for their adult children in iran
"calling it ""the most extreme case"" of harboring a fugitive, prosecutors want the girlfriend of reputed mob boss james ""whitey"" bulger to spend the next decade in prison. catherine greig is scheduled to be sentenced tuesday in u.s. district court in boston. after more than 16 years on the run, she and bulger were captured in santa monica, california, last july. in a detailed memo prepared for the judge, prosecutors describe greig as a ""partner"" who helped bulger avoid capture. ""she not only hid his identity, but also hid the fact bulger had filled their apartment with weapons, enabling bulger to avoid capture by violence if necessary."" the clues that led to bulger's capture bulger, who is being held without bail, was the head of a south boston irish gang before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995. he evaded law enforcement for 16 years before he and greig were arrested in june 2011 in santa monica. james 'whitey' bulger may have authored memoirs, prosecutors say the couple had, for several years, hidden in plain sight in the palm-tree-lined, oceanside city near los angeles in a three-story building named princess eugenia. after discovering the alleged mobster's location, fbi agents lured the couple into the garage from their third-floor apartment on the pretext that someone had broken into their storage locker, and the duo were taken into custody. inside the couple's modest two-bedroom, corner apartment, fbi agents discovered assault rifles, a 12-gauge shotgun, many semi-automatic pistols and revolvers, a silencer, a derringer pistol, multiple hunting knives and bundles of cash. prosecutors say greig could have walked away at any time but protected bulger instead, and in so doing deprived victims' family members of reasonable justice. bulger is accused of 19 murders during his reign of terror in south boston during the 1970s and '80s. fbi: $2.1 million reward paid in bulger case ""the sentence ought to take into account the broader effect of greig's conduct,"" wrote prosecutors, who are also seeking a $150,000 fine and three years' supervised release. bulger's trial is scheduled for november, but his lawyers are arguing there's not enough time to go through the volumes of discovery material they need to prepare bulger's defense. affleck, damon to produce, star in whitey bulger film","catherine greig was girlfriend of reputed mob boss ""whitey"" bulger"
"baghdad, iraq (cnn) -- their faces and darker skins make them look different. they are routinely called ""slave"" by the majority, whatever their profession. but iraq's black population hopes that barack obama's rise to the white house will mark a turning point for minorities not just in the united states, but also in their country. jalal thiyab thijeel quotes barack obama, saying it is time for ""change."" jalal thiyab thijeel, general secretary of the ""movement of free iraqis,"" followed every detail of obama's election campaign. ""inspiring,"" he calls it. inspiring politically, and personally. like obama, thijeel has family roots in africa. ""we told our people, inshalla, god willing, obama is going to win, and if he wins, it will be a victory for all black people in the world,"" he recalls. ""we're going to make him a model to follow. even our old women were praying for him to win."" when news broke that obama had won the election, it was early in the morning of november 5 in basra -- but thijeel excitedly called a fellow member of his political party. it was a moment, he tells me as we talk on a street in baghdad, that he'll never forget. ""now we, the dark-skinned people, feel even closer to the american people because obama is one of us."" thijeel's organization estimates there are approximately 2 million black iraqis. the country's total population is more than 28 million, most of them ethnic arabs. it's impossible to verify thijeel's estimate, since the government does not keep statistics on race, but there is no denying there are many black iraqis in the southern city of basra. their history goes back 1,000 years to the time when africans were brought as slaves to the south of iraq to drain marshes and build basra. many iraqis still call blacks ""abed,"" an arabic word that means ""slave."" thijeel grimaces when he pronounces it. it's demeaning, he says, and he wants the government to forbid its use. many white iraqis claim the word isn't meant to offend, but thijeel says they have no idea how hurtful it is. ""i never want my son to go through this,"" he says. watch what obama means to some iraqis » he also wants his son -- and his daughters -- to have access to good jobs, something that is not the case now, he says. in basra, many black iraqis have menial jobs. although no one can point to any official discrimination, there are no black members of the iraqi parliament. the movement of free iraqis was founded two years ago and on january 31 it will run the first slate of black candidates in iraq's modern history. thijeel hands me the party's documents that spell out its demands. foremost is that the government recognize blacks as an official minority in iraq. this is key, because power in iraq is apportioned along ethnic, religious and even tribal lines. the party also wants an apology for slavery, although it is not asking for financial reparations. the movement also wants laws to combat racial discrimination. the party has found some nonblack political allies. awad al-abdan of the national dialogue front says, ""there's been social oppression for a long time. we have a tribal-based society and, according to traditions and customs, the black man is considered to have lower status."" some white iraqis say that founding a political party on racial lines is divisive, especially when iraqis of different communities need to pull together. but thijeel, quoting barack obama, says it's time for change. although he's speaking in arabic, he uses the english word ""change."" ""there's a change in international politics,"" he tells me. ""obama won, and not that long ago, in his country, black people were marginalized, so this event has shattered all barriers.""","iraqis of african descent are marginalized by society, called ""slave"""
"-- an earthquake shook southern iran thursday evening near a nuclear power plant, killing at least eight people and injuring 59 more, the semi-official fars news agency reported. twelve of the injured were in critical condition, fars said, citing hassan qadami, the head of iran's crisis-management headquarters. the u.s. geological survey said the 5.6-magnitude quake was centered about 39 miles (63 km) northeast of the persian gulf city of bushehr, where the nuclear plant is located, and 7 miles (14 km) northeast of borazjan. the quake struck at a relatively shallow -- and therefore more likely to be damaging -- depth of 10.2 miles (16.4 km) at 5:21 p.m. local time. a reporter for the state-run islamic republic news agency in borazjan said residential buildings were damaged and electricity was disrupted to several areas, including sections of borazjan. the city is in bushehr province, which is the site of a nuclear power plant that went online in 2011. there was no immediate report of how the plant fared in thursday's temblor. iranian president hassan rouhani said he was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of the casualties and expressed condolences to the victims' families. a 6.3-magnitude earthquake in may killed 39 people and injured 850 in bushehr province, but the reactor was not affected, it said. iran's semi-official mehr news said people who were afraid of aftershocks were staying out of their homes. rescue teams were on the scene, mehr said, quoting the governor of bushehr province, fereydoun hassanvand. iran's location atop several major faults leaves it prone to earthquakes. in august 2012, two earthquakes in northwestern iran struck 11 minutes apart -- the first a 6.4 magnitude, and the second a 6.3 magnitude, killing at least 306 people. in 2003, a magnitude 6.6 quake struck the city of bam in southeast iran, killing some 31,000 people. a 1990 quake in the northwestern provinces of gilan and zanjan killed as many as 50,000. cnn's shirzad bozorgmehr contributed to this report","at least 59 injured, fars reports"

"-- after intense diplomacy, the government of mali and the economic community of west african states (ecowas) have agreed that troops from the west african regional block can be based in the capital of bamako, as a step toward ending conflict in the northern part of the country. according to the agreement between the malian government and ecowas, authorities have given the green light for a logistics base on the outskirts of the city. ""there will be no foreign troops fighting in the capital. in return, ecowas requires operational headquarters and a base in bamako together with a police force,"" said nouhou togo, communications officer at mali's ministry of defence. united nations backing for the force will be sought this week by the malian government and ecowas, and is likely to be followed by further negotiations. ""a crisis like this is not solved over night. it takes time and preparation. though, when that day comes, the malian army is ready to go in the north,"" said togo. following a military coup in the capital in march, islamists seized control of two-thirds of the texas-sized nation. mali -- seen as a stable democracy and an example for other less stable countries in the region -- was thrown into chaos. islamist groups -- some of them with links to al qaeda in the islamic maghreb, or aqim -- swiftly seized key towns in the vast and scarcely populated north. soon after taking the towns of kidal, gao and timbuktu, they implemented a hardline form of sharia law including capital and corporal punishments for relatively minor offenses. thieves had their hands and feet amputated while a couple accused of adultery were stoned to death. plans for a large presence of ecowas troops has been fueling political tensions in bamako for weeks. over the last month, the west african regional block has had 3,300 regional troops on standby waiting for a go-ahead from bamako. meanwhile interim president dioncounda traore has opposed a regional force based in bamako. capt. amadou haya sanogo, who led a military junta that toppled the government in march, has made it clear that he does not want ecowas troops in the south of the country, which he argues is already secured by the malian military. resistance to an actual force in the malian capital has also come from several groups, outspoken politicians and the malian people worried about foreign troops flooding into the capital. the request for 3,000 troops to help defeat the islamists and regain control of the north will be considered during a meeting chaired by u.n. secretary general ban ki-moon on the sidelines of the united nations general assembly on wednesday. before the deployment can go ahead, it will need a mandate from the security council, which earlier rejected an intervention plan because of a lack of detail. following the agreement announced sunday regarding ecowas troops, there are still uncertainties about the details of troop deployment. ""the question is if the malian military is ready to go fight in the north. so far i have not seen any proof of this,"" says gilles yabi, a researcher with the international crisis group, a brussel-based nongovernment organiztion seeking to end conflicts. ""the government is still very disorganized and has not been able to agree with the malian military regarding troops deployment,"" said yabi, from dakar in neighboring senegal. given that most of the islamist northern strongholds are in urbanized areas, a military intervention risks harming civilians and even more displacement. according to u.n. figures, over 450,000 malians have already been displaced from their homes -- an ecowas intervention could well raise that number. ""in any scenario a military intervention will have serious humanitarian implications. to date, there has been very little fighting since government forces fled the north -- for the most part armed groups simply carved up the territory. but once the government in bamako begins to act, conflict in the north will escalate,"" said bertrand soret at the european union liazon office in bamako. at some point, argues yabi, the use of force will probably be necessary to neutralize transnational armed groups that indulge in terrorism, jihadism and drug and arms trafficking, and to restore mali's territorial integrity. ""to stabilize mali, the government will have to agree with the algerian politicians to tackle the influx of arms and combatants between a libya still struggling after the fall of (moammar) gaddafi and northern mali through southern algeria,"" said yabi. ""minimal and sustainable security in northern mali cannot be re-established without the clear involvement of the algerian political and military authorities. this is not something the malian army and ecowas forces will be able to tackle themselves.""","after a military coup in march, islamists seized two-thirds of mali"

""while not all may be in need of immediate humanitarian assistance, and the severity of their needs has not yet been fully assessed, this is a higher figure than those who were affected by the 2005 south asia tsunami (3 million), the 2005 south asia earthquake (3 million), or the 2010 haiti earthquake (3 million),"" he said monday in a statement. though the number of fatalities was not comparable with either the tsunami or the earthquake, both of which had death tolls that exceeded 200,000, pakistan's flooding ""is a major disaster of enormous magnitude,"" said john holmes, u.n. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator. many pakistanis are not happy with the government's response to the floods, saying it has been slow and ineffective. pakistani president asif ali zardari returned home monday from an overseas trip, facing growing criticism of his actions following the massive flooding. he had been in england for talks with british prime minister david cameron during the worst of the crisis. prime minister yousaf raza gilani said a true assessment of the loss of life and infrastructure can be determined only after the water recedes. he appealed to the international community and to pakistanis living abroad to help. aid agencies scrambled to help those in need. ""the assistance that we have so far provided has alleviated suffering, but relief operations need to be massively scaled up,"" said martin mogwanja, the u.n. humanitarian coordinator in pakistan. u.s. emergency relief teams continued to arrive in peshawar to help, the u.s. state department said. the u.s. agency for international development has committed $55 million in aid to international organizations and nongovernmental organizations, it said. the united states has provided more than 435,000 meals. this assistance is in addition to u.s. military efforts, which include rescue airlifts, food supplies and other deliveries provided by the pentagon. of the total, $20 million will be used to expand humanitarian operations farther south as the flood zone expands, mark ward, acting director of the office of foreign disaster assistance, told reporters tuesday. cnn's reza sayah and samson desta and journalist nasir habib contributed to this report.",new: the displaced in pakistan include thousands of afghan refugees
"-- u.s. government auditors will review a program that allows airlines to avoid penalties for safety problems by self-disclosing them to the federal aviation administration. the transportation department's office of inspector general, a watchdog, said on tuesday that it would examine the voluntary initiative to ensure it is not being misused as happened previously in the case of a major carrier. congress has requested the review. the faa established the program in 2006 to increase safety by allowing airlines to spend resources to fix safety problems rather than spending time trying to settle disputes with the agency. goal: speedier trip through airport security in a highly critical report two years later, the inspector general's office said faa safety inspectors had grown too close with southwest airlines. the report said inspectors had allowed the carrier to repeatedly self-disclose violations of faa repair orders, absolving it of any penalty without ensuring that the company had come up with a solution for the safety issue. the matter involved 46 boeing 737s that had not been inspected for potential cracks, a problem that could have led to rapid cabin decompression and crashes. when southwest discovered the lapse, faa inspectors encouraged the airline to formally self-disclose the problem and allowed it to operate those planes on 1,451 flights for eight days, the inspector general's report said. southwest later inspected the planes and found fuselage cracks on five, the report said. the company later was assessed a heavy fine by the faa. the voluntary disclosure reporting program is one of at least four self-reporting efforts the faa has adopted to monitor the industry and its own employees to identify problems and trends and prevent accidents. safety experts generally applaud voluntary approaches, saying they increase data available to researchers and can make systems safer if trends are found. the inspector general's office said its review would look at whether the airlines are meeting faa requirements when filing reports and whether regulators are evaluating the industry's corrective actions. the faa created a non-punitive reporting system for air traffic controllers in 2008 and expanded it this year to include employees who maintain radar installations and other systems. the faa said that system has yielded enormous data and prompted corrective steps. who's afraid to fly on september 11? opinion: airport wi-fi and mobile services are lacking philadelphia man charged over phony flight threat",watchdog agency to look at system that allows airlines to self-report problems

"-- a blond girl found in greece whose birth parents were traced to a bulgarian roma village will be cared for by a foster family when she's returned to bulgaria, the government's social services agency said maria, as the girl was known by the roma couple with whom she was living in central greece, was at the center of an international mystery after police discovered her. dna tests eventually showed that saska ruseva and her husband, atanas rusev, were her biological parents. her mother told cnn that she wants her child back -- but that seems unlikely to happen for now. maria, now being cared for by greek children's charity smile of a child, will instead be cared for by a foster family. the parents and their nine children have been living in poverty in a tumbledown, one-room mud brick house in the village of nikolaevo, in central bulgaria. emil todorov, director of the children protection department of bulgaria's agency for social assistance, told cnn it was not yet clear what documents maria would arrive with. bulgaria's state child protection agency has yet to say exactly when and how the girl will be brought from greece, he said. her interactions with her birth family will be determined by who is named as her legal guardian, he said. the agency for social assistance is also taking action to care for the bulgarian parents' seven underage children. the two youngest, ages 2 and 3, will stay with one foster family, said todorov. two other children will stay with another foster family, and a 15-year-old will stay with family members. the remaining two, ages 8 and 12, will be staying at a specialized institution, because no appropriate foster families are available to take them in, he said. working with the parents the placement of the children in foster care is only a temporary stage, todorov said. the goal is to give the parents the chance to improve their living conditions -- in which case they can be reunited with their children. social services will help the parents find a job, he said. ""we have to work with both parents, so that they can expand their parental potential,"" said todorov. while the children are in foster care, social workers will encourage frequent meetings with their parents, so that the family maintains its emotional connection, he said. ""we don't take away the children,"" he said. ""we count on the collaboration by the whole family to cope with this difficult situation."" the agency for social assistance said it had determined the parents had another child too, who was ""abandoned by her parents and raised by a family in another city."" bulgarian police are investigating the rusevs on suspicion they sold maria for illegal adoption. a greek roma couple -- christos salis and eleftheria dimopoulo -- who were found looking after the girl are in custody, charged with kidnapping. daughter given away, says mother ruseva told cnn that she and her husband left for greece in 2009 to look for farm work. she says she left her eldest daughter katia, now 20 years old, to care for the family while they were away. ruseva says she was so thin she did not realize she was pregnant with maria. ""i didn't know i was pregnant. i didn't even have a belly,"" she said. maria -- whom ruseva originally named stanka -- was born in a hospital in the greek town of lamia, about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from farsala and the roma camp where she was discovered this month. ruseva said she cared for maria for seven months while her husband worked in poorly paying odd jobs, picking fruit and vegetables. they often slept in the streets or nearby olive groves, as they had so little money. then one day, when they took a job picking oranges, a woman offered to take care of their daughter and they gave her to the woman because they couldn't care for her themselves, ruseva said. she denies selling the baby, saying she loves her and wants her back. cnn's karl penhaul contributed to this report.",new: social workers will try to help parents improve living conditions so children can return

"-- long before computers or televisions existed, a man who would become a u.s. senator and then president started an affair with his neighbor's wife. even telephones were relatively new back then, so warren harding wrote carrie phillips smoldering love letters during their 15-year relationship that ended prior to his inauguration in 1921. ""i love you more than all the world, and have no hope of reward on earth or hereafter, so precious as that in your dear arms, in your thrilling lips, in your matchless breasts, in your incomparable embrace,"" said a 1910 letter first revealed in the book ""the harding affair"" by james david robenalt. snail mail almost a century later, the snail mail between harding and phillips becomes fully public later this month, revealing the most intimate secrets and thoughts of a man destined for the pinnacle of power as america endured the first world war. in his book, robenalt examines the possible historical impacts of the affair, noting that phillips may have spied for germany and influenced harding against running for president in 1916 as the war approached. ""the harding affair"" ""there's that sex steamy side to these letters,"" he told cnn in an interview monday. ""but there's also the big question of whether the united states should get involved in the first world war. they really debated that back and forth. she was really pro-german, he was very pro-american."" of equal interest, especially in the modern era of celebrity scandal mongering, is the pure salaciousness of the letters' content. ""they really are very graphic love letters,"" said robenalt, who came across them while researching his 2009 book. ""and people think that 100 years ago nobody had sex fantasies and i keep telling people if those people didn't have sex fantasies, we wouldn't be here today."" keeping such a secret seems impossible in today's digitally monitored world. not so back in 1905, a decade before the first coast-to-coast long distance phone call. salacious details as outlined by robenalt's book, harding was married at the time and serving as ohio's lieutenant governor. he recommended that his friend and neighbor jim phillips, carrie's husband, go to a sanitarium that spring to help recover from the death of their 4-year-old son a year earlier. meanwhile, harding's wife florence was recovering from a kidney disease. by august, harding's affair with carrie commenced, though it only became physical three years later, according to robenalt's book. ""i do love you so,"" he wrote in 1913, two years before his election as republican senator from ohio. "" i wonder if you realize how muchâ€”how faithfully, how gladly, how reverently, how wistfully, how whole-heartedly and how passionately. yes, you do know the last, you must have felt the proof, but you can't know the others."" the same letter also showed harding's concern about the affair being discovered, long before the internet age. ""i have been thinking of all those letters you have,"" wrote, adding that ""i think you have a fire, chuck 'em! do. you must. if there is one impassioned one that appeals to you, keep it until you are tired of it, but chuck the rest. why it frightens me to think i ever dared mail them to your address."" by 1916, circumstances had changed, according to another letter. from ""enraptured bliss"" to ""depths of anxiety"" ""it is a little more than thirty-six hours since i saw you, and they have all been given to you, amid the perturbation i could not shake off,"" harding wrote after what robenalt said was a secret visit to phillips in marion, ohio. ""if you designed to punish me you have succeeded fully,"" the letter continued. ""i came with heart a hungering, i knew the flight to enraptured bliss, and was then suddenly plunged to the depths of anxiety."" the problem? someone named robinson, described by robenalt as a rival lover, came to marion. ""i had feared for a year, but would not surrender,"" harding's letter continued. ""i know now of my failure. i sought the impossible, and i am defeated."" robenalt noted the influence of the pending war at that time. ""he ultimately voted for war,"" the author said of harding. ""he knew that it would probably ruin their relationship, and kill him politically in a state that had a lot of german-americans."" the affair ended four years later, as harding ran for president in an election he won easily over democrat james cox. he didn't survive his first term, dying of illness in 1923. in a recent statement, the library of congress announced it would make the more than 1,000 pages of love letters public on july 29, with a discussion about them scheduled for july 22 in the mumford room of the james madison building in washington. photos: presidential inaugurations and oaths through history cnn's paul steinhauser, sherisse pham and kimberly berryman contributed to this report.",coming soon: love letters between warren harding and his mistress
"the syrian regime has used children as human shields and tortured youths whose parents are suspected dissidents, according to a u.n. report. the report on children and armed conflict details accounts of juveniles allegedly abused by pro-government forces and came as a top u.n. official said the conflict in syria has spiraled into a civil war. ""yes, i think we can say that,"" u.n. peacekeeping chief herve ladsous said when asked if syria is in a civil war. ""clearly what is happening is that the government of syria lost some large chunks of territory, several cities to the opposition, and wants to retake control."" ladsous, who made the remarks to two news agencies, was not available for comment tuesday because he was traveling. his spokesman kieran dwyer confirmed them to cnn, but said what one calls it is not what's important. ""whether we call it all-out civil war ,whether we call it partial civil war, civil war in some places, the point is that it's hugely escalated, that it's across nearly all parts of the country and that the civilians, ordinary syrian people, are the ones that are suffering,"" dwyer said. the u.n. report about children, dated late april, was released monday by the united nations. ""most child victims of torture described being beaten, blindfolded, subjected to stress positions, whipped with heavy electrical cables, scarred by cigarette burns and, in one recorded case, subjected to electrical shock to the genitals,"" the report states, citing dozens of witness accounts. ""children were detained and tortured because their siblings or parents were assumed to be members of the opposition or fsa, or they themselves were suspected of being associated with fsa,"" a reference to the rebel free syrian army. dozens of children between ages 8 and 13 were reportedly used as human shields by pro-regime forces during a raid on the village of ayn l'arouz in march, the report says. it includes allegations that rebel forces such as the free syrian army recruited and used children, despite the fsa's stated policy of not recruiting anyone younger than 17 years of age. free syrian army officials could not immediately be reached for comment. mark lyall grant, british ambassador to the united nations, said the u.n. report's findings were ""very disturbing"" and will be looked at ""carefully by all members of the security council. but it's just yet another chapter in the barbarity that is being imposed by the syrian regime on its own civilian population. ""so to be honest, we are not surprised by the report, but it is still an abhorrent example of how far beyond the pale of humanity the syrian regime has gone."" syrian president bashar al-assad's regime has long blamed violence in the country on ""armed terrorist groups."" the country on tuesday lashed out at the united states. a report from the state-run news agency sana cited an ""official source"" at the syrian foreign ministry saying ""that the u.s. administration is continuing its blatant interference in the internal affairs of syria, its open support for terrorists, covering up terrorists' crimes, distorting facts about syria at the u.n., and extorting countries and the international community to beleaguer syria."" a human rights group has implored the u.n. security council to impose an arms embargo on syria. human rights watch said the council should impose targeted sanctions such as asset freezes and travel bans on syrian leaders. citing the syria violations documentation center, a network of syrian activists, the group said at least 1,176 children have been killed since february 2011. after 15 months of bloodshed, the conflict shows no sign of letting up, as regime forces continue shelling cities across the country, opposition activists say. at least 60 people were killed tuesday, including many children and women, the opposition local coordination committees of syria said. sixteen of the deaths occurred in deir ezzor, 23 were in homs and 12 were in aleppo, the group said. a family of six, including an infant, was killed in anadan, in aleppo province, when a shell landed on their home, the lcc said. residents of the pro-government town of al-sheer, near al-haffa, prevented u.n. observers from reaching al-haffa on tuesday by laying down on the road though their town, the opposition syrian observatory for human rights said. the u.n. supervision mission in syria said in a statement that observers trying to reach al-haffa, in lattakia province, ""were confronted with angry crowds that surrounded their vehicles, stopping them from proceeding any further. the crowd, who appeared to be residents of the area, then hurled stones and metal rods at the u.n. vehicles."" ""the u.n. observers turned back. as they were leaving the area, three vehicles heading towards idlib were fired upon. the source of fire is still unclear."" the observers returned to their bases ""and are secure,"" the u.n. statement said. the mission had been trying to reach al-haffa since thursday but has been impeded by ongoing violence in the area, the statement said. u.n. and u.s. officials have expressed concerns about reports that the government was using mortars, helicopters and tanks against the opposition in al-haffa. they've also expressed concerns that residents might be trapped. a banner on state tv said some residents in lattakia province ""tried to explain to members of the observers' mission their suffering from terrorist groups, but the observers did not listen to them. instead, one of their cars hit three citizens,"" two of whom were in critical condition. ladsous spokesman dwyer called the firing on peacekeepers' vehicles ""deliberate and direct,"" and said u.n. officials were evaluating whether the 300 unarmed peacekeepers in syria are safe enough to continue their activities. ""we're looking at all situations,"" he said. u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton expressed concern tuesday about reports that russia may be sending attack helicopters to syria. speakinng at an event in washington, clinton said the united states has confronted russia about stopping its arms shipments to al-assad's regime. state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said the united states has been ""pushing the russians for months to break their military ties with the syrian regime and they haven't done it. and instead they keep reassuring all of us that what they are sending militarily to syria can't be used against civilians. and now what are we seeing? we are seeing the syrian government using helicopters to fire on their own people from the air."" deputy secretary of state william burns will talk with a russian official to discuss syria at an economic meeting thursday in kabul, the state department said. clinton said that there appears to be no easy solution for ending the bloodshed in syria. ""we are approached on a regular basis by representatives of different groups within syria who are terrified of what comes next,"" she told an audience at the brookings institution. ""so, how we manage a political transition -- assuming we could manage a political transition -- how we provide reassurance and some level of protection to christians, druze, alawites, kurds, sunni business leaders and the like; how we prevent a massive inflow of refugees across the jordanian and turkish borders; how we protect lebanon from getting caught up in the sectarian divides that afflict them as well as syria. if these questions had self-apparent and actualizing answers, i would certainly share them with you."" meanwhile, syria said an ""armed terrorist group"" attacked the state-run al-ikhbaria tv channel in al-haffa in ""an attempt to stop national media from conveying the truth."" the group opened fire on a car, and ""al-ikhbaria correspondent mazen mohammad was hit in his hand while cameraman fadi yakoub was hit in his chest,"" state-run news agency sana reported. sana reported that 36 ""martyrs from the army and law enforcement forces"" were buried tuesday. the latest reports of violence came a day after government forces fired indiscriminately from helicopters on a town on the outskirts of jabal al-zawiya, inflicting scores of casualties among civilians and rebel forces, an activist told cnn. ibrahim swed, speaking from the idlib province town, said fighting between the free syrian army and government forces persisted for six hours and resulted in 32 deaths. battle for largest cities may have begun al-assad defined by indecision, violence the united nations estimates that more than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, have died since the crisis erupted in march 2011. opposition groups give estimates ranging from at least 12,000 to more than 14,000. cnn cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or violence in syria, as the government has restricted access by international journalists.",hillary clinton concerned about reports russia supplying helicopters to syria
"(cnn) -- by the year 2050, china will no longer be the most populous country in the world. india will see its population grow by 700 million people by 2050, the u.s. census bureau estimates. that distinction will pass to india, where more than 1.8 billion people could be competing for their country's resources, according to the u.s. census bureau's international data base. the 2007 population estimates from the u.s. census bureau and the united nations population division set china's current population at around 1.3 billion people, and india's at around 1.1 billion. if population continues to grow at the estimated rate, such rapid growth in india between now and mid-century could lead to overpopulation and an uncertain future for the environment and the people living there. and while organizations like the population institute and the united nations population fund are working to promote the human rights and environmental consequences of overpopulation, not everyone views the newest population estimates with pessimism. ""nothing ever continues at its present rate, neither the stock market nor population growth,"" said doug allen, the dean of the school of architecture at the georgia institute of technology, and an expert in the history of cities and urban design, which he's taught for more than 31 years. ""there is a substantial body of evidence that the world population will flatten out in about 30 years,"" he said. ""built into that model would be an assumption that more of the world's population will become urban, and as such the population will begin to decline."" citing historical evidence of falling birthrates in urban populations, allen looks to italy as a current example of the phenomenon. ""italy right now [is] not at a point where it can sustain its current level. and i don't think that's because people in italy have suddenly become aware of the need to conserve resources. i think it has more to do with decisions that are made by families on the margin not to have as many children."" consequences of overpopulation overpopulation occurs when a population's density exceeds the capacity of the environment to supply the health requirements of an individual, according to the environmental protection agency. environmentalists have long been concerned about the resources threatened by rapidly growing human populations, focusing on phenomenon such as deforestation, desertification, air pollution and global warming. but the worst-case scenario for people experiencing overpopulation, according to lawrence smith, president of the population institute, is a lack of fresh, clean water. ""if the water goes, the species goes,"" he said. ""that sounds kind of alarmist,"" smith conceded, ""considering there's water all around us, but 97 percent plus is saltwater, and the freshwater that we use to sustain ourselves is just native to 3 percent. ... so the accessibility of water, the competition for water, the availability of water is going to be a major, major threat,"" he said, noting world population growth estimates at more than 9 billion people by 2050. nine billion is an exceptional amount of people, considering the world's population only reached 1 billion in 1830, according to the population institute, a nonprofit organization that works to fund population and family planning programs around the world. by 1999, world population reached 6 billion, and in the relatively short time between 2007 and 2050, there could be roughly 2.4 billion more people on earth needing clean water, space and other natural resources from their environment in order to survive. governments facing overpopulation will also struggle to manage waste, said allen. ""handling your waste and the public health consequences of not handling it well is the biggest problem that will be faced in rapidly growing urban areas in the developing world."" when london, england, faced a population boom in the 1850s, for example, its infrastructure was not prepared for the excess waste, which resulted in cholera outbreaks. ""huge outbreaks,"" said allen. ""fifty-thousand people dying over the summer. that's the kind of thing that in the developed world we no longer have problems with, but in the developing world are very, very real."" smith said that 97 percent of world population growth between now and 2050 will occur in the developing world, where governments face serious economic and social challenges. ""i would say most of this is in sub-saharan africa, where by every other health indicator, they rank at the bottom,"" smith said. ""this growth rate is taking place despite the high levels of hiv and aids and [tuberculosis] and malaria."" health care -- and the lack of it -- is also a factor in the rising populations in developing countries, according to stan bernstein, united nations population fund senior policy adviser. ""we've seen a global trend of people wanting smaller families, but in the poorer settings that's not quite the case yet,"" bernstein said. ""and it's certainly not the case within countries that the poor [do not] have access to the kinds of services that the wealthy avail themselves of."" globally, bernstein said the poorest fifth of people in countries with rapid population growth have twice as many children, on average, as the wealthy people in those same countries. birthrates make a difference the massive growth in developing nations is due in large part to fertility rates, where women during their reproductive years will have an average of five children, said smith. ""that's considerably higher than it is in the developed world."" in addition to the growing demands of developing nations, emerging countries like china and india are rapidly industrializing, said smith. ""their demands for food alone will have considerable impact on global markets."" china's government has instituted population control methods in order to curb growth. their controversial ""one child"" policies have garnered an uneasy reception, especially in rural populations, where people complain of stiff fines or forced sterilizations and abortions as a result of breaking population laws. traditionally, rural populations are larger than urban populations, said smith. this is because rural families need to be larger in order to work and live off the land, and urban populations -- with better education, health care and family planning opportunities -- offer parents the luxury of choosing how many children they will have, he said. this year is the first year that rural and urban populations are nearly equal, according to the united nations population fund's annual report. this creates a mixed bag of concerns, according to smith, that include susceptibility of young urban populations in poor countries with weak governments to recruitment for terrorism and conditions of instability.

"-- it's time to deal with another scandal involving the secret service — one that leads directly into the white house. there have been several black eyes in recent years for what was once considered one of the nation's most celebrated law enforcement agencies. the organization responsible for protecting the safety of the president and the rest of the first family has done a poor job of protecting its own reputation. besides having to shore up lapses in white house security and recovering from the resignation of its former director, julia pierson, the secret service now has to contend with more fallout from a story that seemed to be over and done with. when it comes to protecting itself, the secret service could take lessons from the white house. there, a cadre of aides, lawyers and spokespeople have become awfully skilled at covering up mistakes, missteps and misbehavior. and yet, the truth has a nasty habit of surfacing eventually. such as whether a 2½-year-old scandal that americans were assured was limited to secret service personnel might also have included someone affiliated with the white house. it was on april 14, 2012 — during the last presidential election — that the news broke that secret service agents had brought prostitutes back to their hotel rooms in cartagena, colombia. the agents were in south america to prepare for a visit by president obama, who was attending a summit on economic development in latin america. if the idea was to encourage infusion of u.s. dollars into the local economy, we can assume that federal agents paying young women for sex was not what organizers had in mind. you would think that one of the top law enforcement agencies in the world would be better at policing the behavior of its own personnel. in the end, nearly two dozen secret service agents and members of the military were punished or fired. but obama administration officials — including white house press secretary jay carney — tried to contain the damage by insisting that no one from the white house was involved. last week, in an astonishingly detailed front page story in the washington post, we learned that may not have been true. according to the post, government documents and interviews reveal that senior white house aides — including kathryn ruemmler, who was then serving as white house counsel — were given information by the secret service at the time suggesting that the scandal extended to a member of the advance team who was in cartagena at the behest of the white house. jonathan dach, then a 25-year-old law student at yale university, was a volunteer with the white house travel office who helped coordinate drivers on the trip. he was paid a per diem, not a salary, and reimbursed for expenses. still, according to the story, travel volunteers are often reminded that their conduct reflects on the president and first lady. the allegation was that dach's conduct in colombia left something to be desired. despite the young man's insistence, through his attorney, that he didn't engage the services of a prostitute or invite anyone to his hotel room, the information that the secret service shared with the white house at the time suggested that dach had registered a prostitute as an overnight guest. that's a serious allegation that should have been thoroughly investigated. but was it? the secret service shared its findings twice in the weeks after the scandal with top white house officials, including ruemmler. each time, the white house counsel and other white house aides conducted an interview with dach and concluded that he had done nothing wrong. those who support the secret service agents insist the white house should have dug deeper. in the end, nothing happened to dach, whose father, it turns out, is a prominent and generous donor to the democratic party. at least try to look surprised. if the different outcomes seem unfair, you're not alone. many in the secret service feel the same way, which probably explains how the story got out. there are reports of widespread dissension within the ranks of the agency over the cartagena scandal. it gets worse. let's not forget the politics. remember, this was all happening during a presidential election year. david nieland, the lead investigator for the department of homeland security who was tasked to look into all this, told senate staffers that he was told to delay the final report of the investigation ""until after the 2012 election."" nieland also said that, during the investigation itself, his superiors told him ""to withhold and alter certain information in the report of the investigation because it was potentially embarrassing to the administration."" white house spokesman eric schultz insisted, ""of course there was no white house interference with an ig (inspector general) investigation."" the picture seems to be coming into focus. what happened in colombia showed bad judgment by secret service agents. if the allegations against dach are true — and we can't be sure -- then his judgment was just as poor. and yet, despite the hijinks in cartagena, it seems what happened next in washington, on the part of white house officials, was the real dereliction of duty. once again, the cover-up may have been worse than the crime. an unnamed administration official disputed that there was a cover-up, telling cnn the white house did thoroughly review the matter and found that dach didn't engage in inappropriate conduct. meanwhile, the post said ruemmler — who now practices law in the private sector — refused to talk about the case. it's no wonder why. she is being considered to replace eric holder as attorney general, and she probably didn't want to foul up her chances. that sort of thing could happen just by having your name linked to a scandal this unseemly. too late. ruemmler has already done that given the ham-handed way she dealt with the allegations against dach. her name should be taken off the short list to replace holder. it's one thing to end your tenure as attorney general under a cloud, as sometimes happens. and it's another to begin it that way. finally, 2½ years after his fateful trip to cartagena, jonathan dach is still part of the administration. he works as a policy adviser at the state department in you can't make this up, folks — the office on global women's issues. even if you believe dach did nothing wrong, the optics are bad. now that's what i call a scandal.",ruben navarrette: it's time to deal with another scandal involving the secret service

""kids can share what they feel comfortable with."" recently, schwartz began to post some students' responses on twitter using the hashtag #iwishmyteacherknew. it spread, as teachers around the country tried it with their own classrooms. they sometimes reveal what kids are most worried about right now, like the child whose mother was sick, or another who had just experienced bullying. one student just wants more attention from the teacher. sometimes, they have a little fun: ""i wish my teacher knew how to do a backflip."" occasionally, students want to reassure their teachers that that they're doing a great job. there's a lot for teachers to learn, too: ""they are kids who deal with a lot as they grow up,"" one educator posted on twitter. schwartz said she's learned not to assume what her students wish. although most of the students at her school live in poverty, not every message is about a material need. there's no pressure to share something they're not ready to talk about, she said, and ""they're acutely aware of their own needs."" through assignments like this, she is, too. as her idea spread, many twitter users asked how they can help to support her students. she's pointed them toward a donorschoose.org fund where she posts a classroom project wish list. so far, most have been fulfilled.",denver teacher kyle schwartz asked students to share what they wish she knew
"-- a portrait painted 400 years ago and kept anonymously in an irish home for much of the time since is now believed to be the only painting of william shakespeare created during his lifetime. the portrait of william shakespeare is thought to be the ""only"" portrait painted during his lifetime. the image reveals a wealthy shakespeare of high social status, contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status, according to stanley wells, a professor who chairs london's shakespeare birthplace trust. wells, a distinguished shakespeare scholar, arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610, when shakespeare would have been 46 years old. ""a rather young looking 46, it has to be said,"" wells said. shakespeare died in 1616. the cobbe portrait -- named after the irish family that owns the painting -- shows shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard. the most common portrait of shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes. the identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until alec cobbe saw a portrait from washington's folger shakespeare library. that painting, which fell into disfavor as a shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of cobbe's portrait. the portrait ""shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of italian lacework which would have been very expensive,"" wells said. ""it establishes, for me, that shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,"" wells said. ""there's been too much of a tendency to believe that shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of england, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life."" wells reads even more into what he sees in shakespeare's newly-found face. ""i think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,"" he said. ""it's the face of a man, i think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. but, of course, as somebody (king duncan) says in shakespeare's story macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'"" it should be noted that shakespeare's king duncan paid a price for judging macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. macbeth later murdered the king. the public can read shakespeare's face from the original painting at shakespeare birthplace trust in stratford-upon-avon where it goes on display for several months starting april 23. the portrait then returns to the cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married england's earl of southampton -- a friend of shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.","shakespeare group unveil ""only"" portrait of playwright painted during his lifetime"

"-- all eyes were on the problem-plagued obamacare website monday after the administration said it would smoothly handle most users following its botched launch two months earlier. white house spokesman jay carney told reporters that 375,000 visitors went to healthcare.gov by 12 noon et, almost half the total daily capacity of 800,000 that officials announced sunday as a result of a round-the-clock effort to fix the site. however, carney provided no details about how many of those visitors were able to sign on and enroll in insurance exchanges set up under president barack obama's signature health care reforms. a new function created in the latest technological overhaul completed sunday put people trying to sign up in an online waiting queue if capacity exceeded demand. they could wait until their turn came to enter the system, or ask to receive an e-mail when they could try again at the front of the line. three cnn journalists who attempted to sign on monday ended up in the new queue around midday and then two hours later. their wait lasted a few minutes before they received a prompt on their screen to proceed with enrollment. later in the day, users proceeded directly to enrollment without waiting, indicating reduced volume at the end of the afternoon, as officials had predicted. having declared the site working as intended on sunday, the administration effectively painted a target on it for detractors led by conservative republicans, who will look for any anecdotal evidence of continued problems with the 2010 affordable care act. the republican national committee wasted no time monday, distributing a list of media reports that noted administration officials warned people to expect continued glitches with the problem-plagued online portal. ""president obama and his administration repeatedly claimed the obamacare website would be fully functioning by the end of november, but this has proven to be just another broken promise,"" said rnc chairman reince priebus. ""the obama administration had over three years to build healthcare.gov, and all they've produced is a non-functioning website, wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars."" administration: we met the website deadline obamacare site fix: 5 things to look for carney made clear more glitches were likely in coming weeks and months, arguing that any major website has periodic problems that must be addressed. ""it does not mean that there will be no problems with the website going forward,"" he said when asked by reporters if healthcare.gov was truly fixed or merely functioning at a minimal level. to carney, the bottom line was that as of monday, ""more people are visiting the site and are able to effectively go from beginning to end"" compared to the unsuccessful launch in october and through november. on sunday, officials announced they had met their self-imposed november 30 deadline for getting the site working for the ""vast majority"" of users, saying response times and error rates had been slashed while capacity increased. jeffrey zients, a former administration official brought in to oversee the website fixes after its launch, compared the hardware upgrades so far to widening a highway on-ramp from two lanes to four. that means chronic breakdowns, error messages and delays users experienced two months ago when the website went live have mostly disappeared, he said, noting the average response time was less than 1 second and the system's ""uptime"" -- a measure of system stability -- was consistently surpassing 90%. it all means that healthcare.gov can now handle its original intended volume of 50,000 concurrent users for a total of 800,000 visitors a day, according to zients. upgrades, trouble-shooting, and old pizza in a commentary in usa today, health secretary kathleen sebelius advised consumers to try the website in off-peak hours -- mornings and evenings on weekdays or else on weekends -- and noted the new feature for times of high demand ""that allows users to opt to receive an e-mail when it's a better time to come back."" she emphasized that consumers have time to sign up, with a december 23 deadline to get coverage that starts on january 1 and a march 31 enrollment deadline to avoid a financial penalty for not having insurance in 2014. back-end problems remain insurers: site glitches persist meanwhile, insurers warn that more work is needed on the ""back-end"" functions of the website that process payments and provide enrollment information to the companies. ""insurers are still getting enrollment files that are duplicative and have missing or inaccurate information,"" robert zirkelbach, spokesman for health insurance industry trade association group america's health insurance plans, said in a statement to cnn. ""in some cases they are not getting the enrollments at all."" the administration chose to stress the positive on monday with a statement saying november enrollment figures on healthcare.gov were expected to be higher than the previous month. an administration official familiar with the matter told cnn that about 100,000 people signed up for coverage last month alone on the site. the official cautioned the number was preliminary and final numbers would be released in mid-december. joanne peters, a health and human services spokeswoman, said enrollment through alternate channels and successful exchanges in 14 states would help bolster november figures. in october, the first month of a six-month enrollment period, just over 106,000 people signed up for obamacare. less than 27,000 of them did so through the healthcare.gov website, which was supposed to be the main enrollment portal. initial enrollment figures lower than hoped website progress garners muted reaction from congress marilyn tavenner, the official charged with implementing obamacare as director of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, told a congressional hearing last month that the administration initially hoped to enroll 800,000 people by the end of november. the overall enrollment target by march 31 is 7 million. a properly functioning healthcare.gov is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the health law that require people to have health coverage. in theory, the law would create large pools of younger, healthier participants whose premiums would help offset the cost of providing care for older policy holders who use the health care system more. the program must convince younger people who might be less inclined to pay for coverage they don't think they need. to gop opponents, the law needs to go. they focused on canceled coverage for some individual policy holders as an example of how obama and democrats failed to fulfill a pledge that people could keep health insurance they liked. gop obamacare playbook: spread negative perception ""this isn't just about a broken website, it's about a fundamentally flawed law,"" said michael steel, spokesman for house speaker john boehner, while conservative republican sen. john cornyn of texas said monday the administration lied to the public about the health care reforms and other issues. ""that's the one thing i find most aggravating about what's happening in washington these days, particularly about this administration, which is a lack of accountability and the willingness to mislead people or provide them just demonstrably false information and expect to be able to move on,"" cornyn said during a google hangout online conversation. cnnmoney: premiums influenced by state roles another republican attack line -- that people are paying more for their health care under obamacare, despite obama's claim that costs would go down -- may depend on where they live, according to a cnnmoney report. in oregon and maryland, state regulators challenged the premiums that insurers wanted to charge for obamacare policies, forcing the companies to lower their rates, said the report by cnn's tami luhby. but in states like florida and texas, regulators took a hands-off approach, allowing premiums that insurers filed to sail through. like most things obamacare, the treatment was infused with politics, with several states run by democrats more active and public about negotiating with insurers while some gop-led states disassociated themselves from the process. rate reviews by states have proved effective in lowering premiums, according to a study last year by the kaiser family foundation. the average rate allowed after a review was 2.6 percentage points lower than the average rate initially requested in the individual market, though there was a wide variation between states. ""if states were more aggressive in reviewing rates, you saw more of a decrease,"" said cynthia cox, policy analyst at kaiser. obama: people do think i'm trustworthy cnn/orc poll: are obamacare's flaws fixable? high court to hear obamacare birth control case cnn/orc poll: obama's marks for management, trustworthiness take hit cnn's martina stewart, kevin liptak, z. byron wolf, ashley killough, lisa desjardins and jim acosta contributed to this report.",healthcare.gov handling visitors without delay early monday evening

""he was right,"" obama replied. veterans groups appeared to support the selection. ""i am excited. i don't know him personally but this is a huge move,"" said paul rieckhoff, executive director of iraq and afghanistan veterans of america. for years, shinseki, a highly decorated vietnam veteran, has been cited as an example by pentagon critics who say the former army chief's sage advice was ignored in 2003, resulting in too few u.s. troops being sent to iraq after the invasion. shinseki testified before the senate armed services committee in february 2003 that ""something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers would be required"" to pacify the country. the comment infuriated some bush administration officials, and he retired just a few months later. shinseki has never spoken publicly about his testimony, which has often been cited by critics as evidence that rumsfeld ignored the advice of one of his key generals. but as army chief of staff, shinseki was not in the chain of command, and played no direct role in drawing up the war plans. pentagon sources say that, in fact, shinseki never advocated higher troop levels for iraq, in part because it was not his job to do so. and sources say that just before the invasion, when asked by then-chairman of the joint chiefs richard myers if he agreed with the war plans, shinseki voiced no objections. still, rieckhoff said, ""shinseki is a guy who had a career putting patriotism above politics. he is a wounded veteran so he understands the plight of veterans."" ireport.com: what do you think of obama's cabinet picks so far? he said shinseki would have to make key connections with the veterans community, adding, ""this is a big name and it shows that he [obama] is not going to treat the veterans affairs secretary as a low priority."" john rowan, president of vietnam veterans of america, called the reported pick an ""interesting choice."" ""i am satisfied with it,"" rowan told cnn on saturday, adding that the choice seems to be in the obama transition team's pattern of ""bringing in strong personalities into all the positions who aren't going to 'yes' him to death."" ""when shinseki had his disagreements with the administration, he wasn't afraid to speak up,"" rowan said. veterans for common sense also weighed in, issuing a statement ""strongly"" supporting shinseki. ""in february 2003, gen. shinseki honestly and correctly assessed our nation's military needs before the invasion of iraq in march 2003,"" the statement said.

"following talks with the pakistani government, secretary of state john kerry said the united states is making progress in the war on terror, and hopes to end the use of drone strikes ""very soon."" the secretary of state told a pakistani television station that president barack obama has a ""very real timeline"" for ending the strikes. he did not provide specifics on the timeline. ""we hope it's going to be very, very soon,"" kerry said thursday, according to a transcript provided by the state department. ""i believe that we're on a good track. i think the program will end as we have eliminated most of the threat and continue to eliminate it,"" kerry said. he added that the cessation depends on ""a number of factors"" and that washington is working on it with the pakistani government. a state department statement later addressed kerry's remarks. ""today, the secretary referenced the changes that we expect to take place in that program over the course of time, but there is no exact timeline to provide,"" the statement said. however, it said, the goal is to get to a place where threats are eliminated and drones are not needed. ""now, we're all realistic about the fact that there is a threat that remains and that we have to keep up ... the fight in this and other places around the world,"" marie harf, a state department spokeswoman, said. ""so this was in no way indicating a change in policy. it's really been reinforcing things i think we've said for months on this."" the united states ramped up strikes in the tribal region in the first few years of obama's presidency. but the number of strikes in pakistan has since dropped partly because of al qaeda's decline in the country and more u.s. focus on threats from al qaeda groups in other countries, such as yemen. in may, obama defended the use of drone strikes as a necessary evil, but one that must be used with more temperance as the united states' security situation evolves. america prefers to capture, interrogate and prosecute terrorists, but there are times when this isn't possible, obama said in a speech at the national defense university in washington. terrorists intentionally hide in remote locations and putting boots on the ground is often out of the question, he said. however, he urged caution and discipline.

"-- the disgraced politician at the center of china's biggest political scandal in years has been linked to a criminal act for the first time since he was removed from office, the state-run xinhua news agency has reported. bo xilai, who was head of the communist party in the southwestern city of chongqing and once seen as a future president, was reportedly warned by his former right-hand man that his wife was suspected of murder. the revelation came during this week's trial of wang lijun, bo's former police chief and vice mayor in chongqing. in the first official account of the two-day hearing, the court was told that wang was ""angrily rebuked"" and slapped on the face by bo -- who the report referred to as the major official in charge of chongqing's municipal party committee -- when he revealed his suspicions, xinhua said. former chinese police chief charged wang was on trial charged with abuse of power, defection and bribe-taking. the case, which precipitated bo's downfall, began after wang arrived at the u.s. consulate in the nearby city of chengdu one evening in february in an apparent asylum attempt. during a frenzied 24 hours, he reportedly revealed to u.s. officials a jaw-dropping tale of corruption and murder involving his boss. wang was later collected by central government authorities and disappeared from the public eye. timeline: bo xilai's fall from grace according to thursday's xinhua report, guo weiguo, a former high-ranking police official, heard the exchange between the two men on january 28 this year. he told police: ""once wang was slapped, the hostility between wang and bo came out into the open."" bo's wife, gu kailai, was found guilty of murder in the death of a british businessman neil heywood last month. chinese authorities reported that gu and her son had ""conflicts"" with heywood ""over economic interests."" gu kailai avoids death penalty prosecutors at his trial allege wang knew gu was involved in the murder of heywood last november but covered up for her. but this relationship became increasingly strained as wang became concerned by the number of people who became aware of the murder case. in his confession, wang described how gu became hostile ""and began to guard herself against me,"" xinhua said. bo had been an influential and controversial member of the communist party's politburo, the elite group of 25 men who run china. appointed to the top job in chongqing in 2007, wang was assigned to lead his crime-fighting program. under wang, the ""da hei"" or smash black campaign reportedly caught nearly 3,000 criminal groups and detained thousands of suspects. it also led to the execution of notorious figures in the city's underworld. bo xilai: from rising star to scandal the crackdown, along with economic reforms in the city of more than 30 million, helped burnish the political credentials of bo, who aspired for a spot in the party's standing committee of the politburo, a nine-member body that effectively rules china. but wang's heavy-handed, crime-busting methods were decried as brutal by critics. bo's red-tinged economic policies -- which have included millions spent on social housing -- garnered him a rock star status in chongqing but in beijing, some party chiefs were taking a different view. his populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the economically liberal and reform-oriented faction within the chinese communist party (ccp). the political divisions came to a boil in march when china's national legislature convened its annual meeting in beijing. speaking to reporters on march 9 on the sidelines of a panel discussion of chongqing delegates, bo defended his policies. ""ask any citizen on the street if they support fighting corruption and they'll say 'yes',"" he boomed. addressing the rich-poor divide, he said: ''if only a few people are rich then we are capitalists, we've failed."" that may have been bo's last stand. on march 14, premier wen jiabao obliquely reprimanded chongqing's leadership over the wang incident during the premier's annual press conference. wen also referred to the damage wrought by the cultural revolution -- a reference that alluded to bo's red revival in chongqing -- and said that the city's stellar double-digit economic performance had been the fruits of several administrations and not just bo's work alone. the following day, bo was sacked and stripped of his political office due to an unspecified ""serious breach of party regulations."" the party still hasn't revealed what those regulations are. but until the trial of wang, there had been no suggestion bo had been aware of his wife's actions before her arrest and conviction for murder. cnn's steven jiang, jaime florcruz and dayu zhang contributed to this report.",bo xilai's former right-hand man said he warned his boss his wife was a murder suspect

"-- senior citizens are common in florida but one 74-year-old is in a class of her own: ""little mama"" is believed to be the oldest chimpanzee in captivity. born in africa, she was one of the first residents at lion country safari theme park in loxahatchee, florida, about 20 miles west of west palm beach. ""she came here when the park opened in 1967,"" said lion country safari wildlife director terry wolf, who has been with the park just as long. wolf said the park's owners bought her from a pet dealer. ""it was a whole different world then,"" explained wolf. ""chimps in pet shops that were babies at that time could go for 10 grand."" wolf doesn't know how much the park's owners paid for little mama, who was certainly no baby when she came to lion country safari 45 years ago. the owners said that little mama was part of the ice capades, a traveling variety show that performed on ice across the united states, before she was acquired by the pet dealer, wolf said. ""she was very sweet, very good with people,"" recalled wolf. ""obviously somebody treated her nicely."" laboratory chimps get a new lease on life when world-renowned primatologist jane goodall visited the theme park in 1972, wolf was anxious to introduce her to little mama. at that time birth records for chimpanzees were not kept so wolf did the next best thing: he asked the expert to estimate little mama's age. goodall determined that the chimpanzee was between 30 and 35 years old. splitting the difference, the park decided to put her age at 32. claim of octogenarian chimp prompts questions caretakers decided to mark little mama's birthday each valentine's day, since she has a sweet tooth: cakes, pies and sodas are among her favorite foods. she may be the oldest chimpanzee in captivity but she does not look her age when compared to other chimpanzees. little mama is petite, weighing about 100 pounds, and the only physical indication of her age are the gray hairs on her chin. ""look at cooper,"" said wolf referring to the chimpanzee in the cage next to little mama. ""cooper probably looks to you, after seeing some other chimps, like he's 900 years old (but) he's 35."" cooper was born in sierra leone and spent his early years as a research test subject in new york state. ""before he was 5 years old, he had probably 70 liver biopsies and they knocked him down with some horrific drugs,"" said wolf. ""right now he's suffering with severe arthritis in his hips."" although more than twice cooper's age, little mama's last physical showed her in good health with clean lungs and a strong heart. wolf believes that excellent care in the pet industry may be the reason she is healthy at her advanced age. the life span for chimpanzees is 40 to 50 years in the wild and for those in captivity it is 50 to 60 years, according to the center for great apes. when asked about little mama's life expectancy wolf responded, ""i'd like to think she will be around longer than me.""","""little mama"" has been at florida's lion country safari park since 1967"
"-- for most designers, good design is neither just a well-functioning object nor a good-looking object, but rather both. i say both, as the simultaneity is crucial so that function and appearance support each other and, when done well, in a sense become indistinguishable. in designing products, we consider these two attributes -- along with other factors such as budget, material capability and consumer response -- and add them to the mixture that constitutes design. what steve jobs did was to add yet another element: innovative marketing. have you ever been in an apple store that isn't packed with people ""just browsing?"" they are there to soak up whatever apple is and does. who would ever have thought that bulky, wooden parsons tables would be enough? but you can bet on one thing: jobs did not go to market research groups to find the answer. he knew that all each store would need, beyond its terrific merchandise, were bare essentials. think about it: he didn't need flashing neon, he didn't need hip tunes blaring so that you couldn't hear each other, he didn't need wild colors or expensive materials. he simply needed a clean space with a sales force of people, each wearing an apple t-shirt. i gasp whenever i see, in a newspaper or magazine, a new restaurant where the designer has opted for outrage in his or her need to be the next cutting-edge idea, forgetting that the customer might just want a good place to eat with friends. i imagine that jobs would not have had a hand in that type of scenario. he might simply have said, ""it's not that difficult. after all, it's just about dinner."" share your memories of steve jobs designers often neglect the essence of innovation when they are overwhelmed with the requirements of the product they are designing. the apple store design, the product design, the hardware design and software design all come down to innovation -- something not tried before. i am reminded of an apocryphal story about pablo picasso. two frumpy ladies were standing in front of a cubist portrait of gertrude stein, or at least the label said ""gertrude stein."" one woman turned to her friend and said, ""it doesn't look like gertrude stein."" whereupon picasso, who happened to be standing behind them, said in a prophetic tone, ""it will."" in a commencement address to stanford university graduates that's been widely televised since his death, jobs revealed something about himself that i, too, have felt intensely since i suffered paralysis. of course, being aware that his illness would limit his time, he said that he wanted every day to be spent making a contribution. one imagines that jobs, given how much he loved doing what he did, wanted to leave this world exhausted from his passion for his life's work, for that's all that would give him rest. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of michael graves.",designer michael graves says steve jobs added innovation to the designer's tool kit

""this is a significant breakthrough on the road to health care reform, one that will make the difference in the lives of many older americans,"" obama said at the white house. ""today marks a major step forward, but it will only be meaningful if we complete the journey. ... i have to repeat and revive an old saying we had from the campaign: yes, we can. we are going to get this done."" the nation's top drug manufacturers agreed over the weekend to at least a 50 percent discount for most beneficiaries for brand-name medicines purchased in the so-called ""doughnut hole"" gap in coverage, obama noted. the gap involves medication costs of senior citizens between roughly $2,700 and $6,100 a year that are not covered by the medicare part d plan. the deal will be part of an $80 billion reduction in medicare drug costs for senior citizens over the next 10 years, according to senate finance committee chairman max baucus, d-montana, who helped negotiate the agreement. part of that $80 billion will go to closing the medicare prescription drug ""doughnut hole."" congressional staffers did not have precise estimates, but finance committee spokesman erin shields said they expect the $80 billion commitment to both cover the medicare drug gap and leave additional money for other, still unannounced, programs. the american association of retired people, the nation's largest organization of senior citizens, has praised the pharmaceutical industry agreement as a step toward health care reform. obama spokesman robert gibbs noted monday that aarp was opposed to health care reform during the first term of former president bill clinton in the early 1990s. ""you've got the pharmaceutical industry and the largest group representing seniors in this country, who 16 years ago weren't at the table but were on the other side of the political debate,"" gibbs said of groups expressing support monday for health care reform. ""i think that represents progress and important steps towards real reform."" overhauling health care is a top priority of obama's administration, but the initial proposals to reach congress last week received a rocky reception. the congressional budget office determined that either of two similar bills written by senate democrats would cost more than $1 trillion, which was higher than expected. republican opponents immediately slammed the measures, and the senate finance committee delayed scheduled hearings on one of the bills. hearings by the senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions on the other measure began amid intense partisan bickering, with hundreds of amendments proposed by republican opponents. at least two more bills are expected from the house of representatives, and a bipartisan group led by former senate majority leaders tom daschle, howard baker and bob dole also has offered guidelines for a proposal. at issue is how best to reduce the cost and increase the reach of the current health care system, which officials say is increasingly draining personal, corporate and government budgets while leaving 46 million americans without health insurance. obama has warned that a failure to act soon will bring far worse economic difficulties than the costs of plans under discussion. both parties in congress agree on the need to slow the increase in health care costs while ensuring that all americans can get health insurance, but they differ sharply on how to proceed. democrats generally favor a government-funded ""public option"" to compete with private insurers. republicans have said such a step would lead to a government takeover of health care, which they oppose. republicans also accuse obama and democrats of trying to rush through what they say is flawed legislation in 2009 before the politics of midterm elections in 2010 and the 2012 presidential race. the parties do appear to agree on several broad principles, however, including an emphasis on preventive care, cost-cutting measures in the existing medicare and medicaid programs, and a halt to denials of coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions. cnn's lisa desjardins contributed to this report.",deal discounts drugs for some on medicare when benefits reach gap in coverage
"-- toyota's recent recall of millions of vehicles for sticking accelerator pedals may get drivers wondering: what should you do if a vehicle is accelerating uncontrollably? accelerator pedals in the 2.3 million vehicles that toyota recalled may, in rare circumstances, become stuck after the pedal mechanisms become worn, the automaker has said. toyota says it is shipping reinforcement parts to dealers, and that dealers will start repairs as soon as this weekend. the u.s. transportation department urges owners of the recalled vehicles to arrange fixes as soon as possible, though toyota says the sticking problem is rare and happens gradually, and if no sticking is noticed in a vehicle, it should be safe to drive. if the pedal starts to feel sticky but isn't yet stuck, stop driving and call a dealer to arrange for your vehicle to be picked up, toyota says. but if the pedal is stuck in a depressed position, here is what the driver can do, according to omar panjshiri, a certified toyota technician at the chantilly repair center in chantilly, virginia: • shift the transmission to neutral • turn off the ignition switch • apply the brakes and pull over with the engine cut off, ""you will lose some power steering assist, but you will still be able to steer the vehicle to a safe stopping position,"" panjshiri said. full coverage: toyota recall some 2009 and 2010 vehicles involved in the recall have buttons for the ignition, rather than keys. in this case, to cut power to the engine, push the button and hold it for more than three seconds, panjshiri said. ""[otherwise,] you'll do the same exact thing: shift ... [from] drive position to neutral, and steer the vehicle safely to a shoulder to come to a complete stop,"" he said. vehicles in the recall are: toyota's 2009-2010 rav4, corolla and matrix; 2005-2010 avalon; certain 2007-2010 camrys; 2010 highlander; 2007-2010 tundra; and the 2008-2010 sequoia. the camry hybrid is not included. cnn's brian todd and cnnmoney.com's peter valdes-dapena contributed to this report.","technician: if accelerator pedal is stuck, shift to neutral and cut ignition"
"-- new mexico -- one of three states that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses -- is debating whether to change the practice. the state's lawmakers were scheduled to take up the issue in a special session on tuesday. however, there are nearly a dozen other issues they must address by the end of the session, which could last up to 30 days. the session was originally scheduled to focus on redistricting for statewide elections, but the governor put the driver's license issue on the docket. republican susana martinez, the nation's first latina governor, campaigned on a promise to stop undocumented immigrants from getting licenses. the state's house in march passed a measure to start requiring license applicants to have social security cards, which are available only to legal residents. the senate has rejected house bill 78, however. a push is underway to swing the vote in the senate, with martinez leading the effort. immigrant-rights advocates defend the current practice. it was intended to offer undocumented immigrants ""the opportunity to buy insurance, register their vehicles and have a driving record available to all law enforcement,"" said marcela diaz of somos un pueblo unido (we are a united people). but critics say the practice is turning new mexico into a magnet for fraud. ""currently, illegal immigrants from all over the country come to new mexico to obtain a license without having the intention of staying here,"" said demesia padilla, the state's secretary of taxation and revenue. some scofflaws sell their residency information. one woman, rosa pardo-marrufo, confessed to allowing her address to be used -- charging up to $700 for each application. she was arrested in 2009 and is serving 10 years in prison for fraud. the state taxation and revenue department has pushed a ""residency certification program."" aiming to expose residency fraud, officials began sending letters in july to 10,000 of the more than 84,000 immigrants who have been issued a license without a social security number. they've been asked to prove their state residency or lose their licenses. on thursday, a new mexico district judge placed a temporary restraining order on residency certification, in response to a lawsuit against the taxation and revenue department by the mexican american legal and educational defense fund (maldef). a hearing on september 13 will determine whether judge sarah singleton's restraining order will become permanent. utah and washington are the only other states that grant undocumented immigrants driver's licenses. cnn's christopher lett contributed to this report.",new: special session to address other issues could last up to 30 days
"-- italian club lazio has been charged over the ""alleged racist behavior"" of its fans during november's europa league clash with tottenham. supporters of the rome side mocked the english team's links with the jewish community by chanting ""juden tottenham, juden tottenham"" (""tottenham jews"" in german) in the 0-0 draw in the italian capital. tottenham has a large contingent of jewish supporters, while lazio has long had fans with right wing sympathies. ""proceedings will also be instigated against s.s. lazio for throwing of missiles and/or fireworks by their supporters, incidents of a non-sporting nature, late team arrival at the stadium, and late handling of the team sheet,"" european football's governing body uefa said on monday. it added that tottenham also faces charges related to crowd disturbances at the group j game, which took place 24 hours after a knife attack on its fans in rome. it is not the first time this season that lazio supporters have been accused of racism, with the club fined â‚¬40,000 (us$52,000) for abuse directed at tottenham's black players during the clubs' previous meeting in london in september. the charges, which will be heard on january 24, continue a bad week for the standing of football in italy, with the country's reputation having also been ""damaged"" in the eyes of former prime minister silvio berlusconi after last week's racism walkoff involving ac milan. former ghana international kevin-prince boateng made global headlines when he reacted to abusive chanting from a section of pro patria fans in a friendly against the fourth tier side by walking off the pitch -- and the entire milan side followed him. his actions earned widespread praise, including from milan owner berlusconi himself, but fifa president sepp blatter is not among those who believe that boateng's behavior was a step in the right direction. ""walk off? that's not the solution,"" blatter was reported to have said in abu dhabi-based newspaper the national. ""i don't think you can run away, because eventually you can run away if you lose a match. this is a very touchy subject, but there is zero tolerance of racism in the stadium."" despite his credibility on the topic having been damaged in the eyes of many pundits after he told cnn in 2011 that racism could be settled by a handshake, blatter is now advocating tougher punishments to deal with the issue. ""the only solution is to be very harsh with the sanctions -- and the sanctions must be a deduction of points or something similar,"" he said on sunday. this is the first time that blatter has publicly suggested a points deduction for clubs whose fans are racially abusive -- a stance which is backed by many figures within the game, including former arsenal stars patrick vieira and sol campbell. two days after boateng walked off against pro patria, racism reared its ugly head again in italy as some sections of lazio's crowd were heard making monkey noises at cagliari's black colombian striker victor ibarbo. although many of the crowd inside the stadio olimpico for the serie a league clash jeered and whistled to drown out the racists, the referee was forced to halt play as he spoke to both team captains and ordered a message to be relayed over the pa system to warn fans that continued chanting would result in the game's suspension. late last week, former milan midfielder clarence seedorf warned that walking off pitches in protest at abusive chanting threatened to ""empower"" the racist minority. should lazio be found guilty of the charges, pressure will fall on uefa to take tough sanctions after the body was widely criticized for issuing what was seen as a paltry $105,000 fine to the serbian fa after an under-21 match where opposing england players said they were racially abused. the punishment fell short of the $125,800 fine uefa handed to denmark international nicklas bendtner for exposing boxer shorts adorned with the logo of an online betting company during the 2012 european championships.","lazio charged by uefa over ""alleged racist behavior"" of fans during europa league clash"

"-- hawaii's garden isle, kauai, may appear to run on a different clock than the rest of the world -- unless you happen to glance at those 24 timepieces lining the west wall of the island's lihu'e airport departure lobby in three neat rows. then, for however many seconds you wish to suspend your whole notion of time, it's the exact same hour, minute and second everywhere on the planet. in belfast and bhopal. rio de janeiro and reykjavik. mogadishu and santo domingo. and according to several other location-specific clocks straying from the usual tokyo-paris-new york scheme. ""when you look at these clocks it's a little bit odd,"" says parker croft, a kauai-based architect, farmer and the creator of ""time for one world,"" an international art exhibit that aims to dispel, however momentarily, the whole divided (and delusive) notion of multiple times around the globe. inspired by einstein ... and y2k launched at vermont's burlington international airport, the exhibit was conceived by croft while working as a college professor in new england. ""it was 1999, shortly before the millennium change, and i was fascinated by that whole y2k furor going on,"" recalls croft. ""it led me into researching what time is really all about and how -- as einstein poignantly put it -- time is 'man's most pervasive illusion.'"" the world's time zones, notes croft, are ""currently based on political borders and outdated views of travel, commerce and communications. divisions that are often illogical."" to address the point, the architect designed an alternative artistic model of a single, shared 24-hour cycle worldwide, which ""challenges us to relax our preconceived notions of structures that are contrived and artificial."" one universe. one world. one time. in croft's model, time would be re-calibrated biannually on the equinoxes (fall and spring). leap year adjustments would be replaced by a brief semi-annual time stoppage (about three hours), a ""free time"" recess dedicated to a worldwide celebration of humanity and relationships. can you imagine that? could john lennon even imagine that? wounded knee, hiroshima, falkland islands represented the overall effect of 24 oddly labeled clocks evoking universal time ""can be unsettling for some -- even threatening,"" says croft. in fact, the curious clocks of kauai serve to achieve the opposite. to unite and embrace. ""we are a planet that is joined in the beat of a single heartbeat,"" says croft. ""and that heartbeat is best appreciated when it's recognized and celebrated."" travelers glancing at the distinctive lihu'e airport clocks, installed more than a decade ago (the installation is on long-term loan to the lihu'e airport, says croft, but isn't necessarily permanent) have plenty to get their time-addled heads around before their flight departs. there are no numbers on the clocks, which are divided into 24-hour faces instead of twelve, with each clock displaying the exact same time in perfect sync. then there are the 24 locations labeled below each clock -- selected from 24 separate 15-degree segments of the earth's surface, and all associated with important historical events. ross ice shelf. falkland islands. bikini atoll. watts. not your typical wall clock reference points. auschwitz is written in polish. hiroshima in japanese. tiananmen square in mandarin. non-sioux speakers will wonder where the clock labeled cankpe o (wounded knee) refers to -- which is just the point. some references should be obvious enough (chernobyl). others, like san francisco (summer of love?) or ahmedhabad (hint: gandhi) or injinoo may require personal interpretation or the services of google. which is also the point. ""the inspiration for independent research is an important part of this mission,"" notes croft. ""the viewer's participation is critical."" a world without leap year in a world as troubled and triumphant as this one, sliced into manufactured time zones that accentuate distance over connection, the presence of 24 perfectly synchronized world clocks beating as one in a small south pacific airport might, at the very least, give travelers a moment's pause. and beyond that? are there fans of croft's suggestion to just stop time for three hours in the spring and fall? ""i don't think anyone takes it that seriously as a proposal,"" says croft with a laugh. ""but there are certainly fans of the art installation who take the notion of stopping to celebrate humanity quite seriously. ""personally,"" he adds, ""i think it would be a big improvement over new year's eve.""",kauai's lihu'e airport is home to a unique collection of world clocks

"-- a brewing pacific storm will pour desperately needed rain on california's historic drought, but the pending wet wallop promises to carry a high price as schools in san francisco and oakland are bracing themselves and will be closed thursday, officials said wednesday. the rainfall is expected to be so significant that meteorologists call its source an ""atmospheric river."" many people in northern california were bringing lawn items inside. but not everything. ""i'm just trying to bring some stuff down that might blow away. we are not taking down the christmas decorations though, leaving those up unless it gets real bad,"" ryan higgins of sunnyvale said. higgins, who owns a comic book store, said he and his family had a ""handful of sandbags"" because their residential complex tends to flood even with a little rain. already, the fingertips of the storm were ravaging the coast of washington state, eroding a beachline and threatening homes, according to a cnn affiliate komo reporter's tweets. the fire-hose weather system will slam into the west coast by thursday, forecasts say. atmospheric rivers are 250 to 400 miles wide and split off like a tributary from a much larger band of moisture from the tropics. they only come occasionally but are necessary to fill up water reservoirs, the nws says. ""up to 50% of annual precipitation on the west coast occurs in just a few ar events."" on the weather map, the storm looks like a cloud river in the sky flowing straight at the coast, and in combination with the storm system chasing it ashore, it is expected to dump 2-5 inches of rain in many places this week. the highest elevations of northern california might get 10 inches of rain, forecasters said. san francisco could see 2 to 4 inches in the city with up to 8 inches in the hills. schools shuttered the san francisco and oakland unified school district officials blamed their planned closures on the potential downpour. ""closing schools is a serious decision,"" said sfusd superintendent richard a. carranza in a statement, according to cnn affiliate kron. ""i did not arrive at this lightly. first and foremost, we don't want to risk having our students injured or seriously delayed transporting to and from school. in addition to student absences, the storm could result in large numbers of staff absences, which could then lead to inadequate supervision of our students. furthermore, power outages could affect the district's ability to feed students' school meals, among many other operational challenges."" in a message to students and staff on the district's facebook page, oakland school officials cited ""an extreme and potentially dangerous weather system"" as the reason for the closings. ""we recognize this decision will interrupt the normal routine and require some families to seek other child-care alternatives and we apologize in advance for the inconvenience. we do, however, feel it's our responsibility, given the dire reports from the national weather service, that we take this precaution and steps to maximize student and staff safety."" southern california might get 1 to 2 inches with twice as much in the hilly areas. that much rain may be more common, if you live along the gulf or atlantic coasts, but for parched california, which researchers at the university of nebraska say is the most drought-stricken state in the country, it's a lot to handle at once. and in many areas, it comes on top of high rains last week. the weather service warned there could be moderate river flooding in california and washington. folks in oregon were expecting high winds thursday, but in seaside, 80 miles northwest of portland, it was already blustery on wednesday.

"-- international envoy kofi annan said tuesday he sees iran as a factor in diplomatic efforts to forge peace in syria, a stance not shared by the united states. ""i think iran can play a positive role,"" annan said during a news conference with iranian foreign minister ali akbar salehi in tehran. his remarks came a day after he met with syrian president bashar al-assad in damascus. annan said al-assad agreed on ""an approach"" to ending the 16 months of bloodshed in his country. world powers have deplored al-assad's government for its assaults against civilians. but the diplomatic wranglings, such as annan's recent action group meeting in geneva and the u.s. and arab-backed friends of syria initiative, have failed to stop the killings of thousands since march 2011. the opposition local coordination committees of syria recorded at least 68 deaths tuesday. the u.n. and arab league special envoy to syria, annan is visiting leaders in the region to find ways to implement his six-point peace plan, an initiative that has yet to gain traction. annan said he believes iran can play a key role in helping end the violence in syria. tehran is a friend and ally of the al-assad regime, but the united states and other nations exploring peace moves in syria have opposed iranian participation in the diplomacy. state department spokesman patrick ventrell cited ""iran's destructive behavior in syria,"" a reference to its support for the government's fierce offensive against its opponents. ""we want them to stop that destructive behavior,"" ventrell told reporters monday. ""and so, of course, kofi annan in tehran, to the extent that he can stress to the iranians the importance of cooperating with the plan, that's a good thing. but we haven't seen signs of that either yet."" ""if the iranian regime wants to stop giving direct material support to the syrian killing machine, then -- and play a constructive role -- we would welcome that. we're not at that point yet."" annan, however, says that ""iran has a role to play."" ""here i am talking to minister salehi and seeking the support and cooperation of iran in my efforts to resolve this conflict peacefully,"" he said. asked about his meeting on monday with al-assad, annan said the two discussed efforts to end violence, but he didn't want to mention details until he talked with opposition leaders. al-assad ""made a suggestion of building an approach from the ground up in some of the districts where we have extreme violence -- to try and contain the violence in those districts and, step by step, build up and end the violence across the country."" peace moves have failed to get off the ground at the united nations and among western and arab nations, despite world outrage over syria's brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrations. ""the political process is yet to begin, a political process that would bring all parties to the table. and this is one of the key points of the six-point plan,"" annan said. ""and i think that the essence of the six-point plan is stopping the violence, releasing detainees, allowing humanitarian access -- which should be seen as a package, a package that if complemented will help create the environment and the conducive climate for political talks -- political talks between the syrians to determine their own political future."" russia also supports an iranian role in syria. while members of the u.n. security council, which includes the united states, have called for an end to the violence and for al-assad to step aside, efforts to adopt a resolution that would allow for aid to the rebels have been blocked by russia and china, key syrian trade partners. moscow and beijing are strongly opposed to armed intervention, saying the outcome in syria should be decided by its people. russia, in fact, said it will not deliver new weapons to syria as long as the situation in that country is unstable, an official at the body in charge of monitoring russia's arms trade said monday, according to state media. it had been the longtime principal supplier of arms to syria since the days when it was the soviet union. two russian military transport ships were scheduled to transit through the dardenelles strait tuesday, on their way to their expected destination, the syrian port of tartous, a u.s. official said. the ships -- the the filchenkov and kunikov -- had been closely watched by u.s. intelligence for the last several weeks while docked in the black sea port of sevastopol. the russians have said any weapons and personnel on board the ship are for reinforcement of the tartous facility. annan went to baghdad later tuesday for talks on syria with iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki. as the conflict persists, syrians are fleeing to neighboring countries such as iraq and to safe places in their own country. there's been a ""significant increase"" in the flight of refugees to jordan in the last two weeks and authorities are working on the development of large sites to accommodate them, andrew harper, head of the u.n. refugee agency in jordan, told cnn tuesday. he said there are about 130,000 syrians in jordan but not all of them are refugees. he said about 50,000 need assistance, but authorities are concerned that the number will continue to grow. daraa, one of the major syrian cities engulfed in violence, is near jordan. cnn's kareem khadder and barbara starr contributed to this report",an opposition group recorded at least 68 deaths tuesday
"arlington, texas (cnn) -- to begin with, gregory rose didn't have health insurance. plus, it was finals week. so his first instinct was to ignore the pain. a nurse takes blood from gregory rose, who has leukemia. a walk across his apartment convinced him otherwise. ""my hip was like on fire, grinding"" is how he recalled the morning seven months ago that changed everything. ""i know pain, and i've never felt that kind of pain before,"" rose said. at the hospital, a blood test with startling results: a dramatically elevated white blood cell count. he had leukemia, at 23. rose had no health insurance because he was too old to be covered on his parents' policy and too young and seemingly healthy to think he needed it. so count rose among the estimated 47 million americans who lack health insurance, and as a resident of a state with the highest percentage of uninsured: nearly one in four texans do not have health coverage. despite no coverage, he received expert care through the jps health network, a county hospital that sees 800,000 patients a year, and where fewer than 7 percent of the patients have private health insurance. ""i have had excellent doctors --- excellent doctors,"" rose said. ""the chemo just wears you down. i had to be admitted for five days every time, every three weeks."" he is cared for through a hospital program called jps connection, which is geared to help those without insurance get care --- and to look to see if they are eligible for any government assistance. rose initially was put on medicaid, then at a social worker's suggestion applied for social security disability payments. but after he started receiving them, his medicaid was cut off because texas is one of a dozen states that counts such payments against its income standards for medicaid. ""now i have no insurance again,"" he said with a sigh. ""godspeed"" is how robert earley, the jps ceo, responds when the health care debate in washington is brought up. nearly 15 percent of the hospital's patients are on medicare, another 14 percent medicaid. most don't have any coverage. so while he backs effort to find a way to cover the millions of uninsured americans, earley and his chief of medicine, dr. gary floyd, said they worry president obama's plan to pay for his effort to overhaul health care, in part, by squeezing billions from medicare and medicaid could do as much or more harm than good. ""then you either cut services or you cut payments to providers,"" floyd said. ""and in texas we have a significant problem with medicaid. only 38 percent of our physicians participate in medicaid programs. ... so if we start squeezing the payment rates down or freezing them, there are fewer and fewer physicians who will want to participate in those programs."" in texas, another major concern is how overhauling health care will deal with the question of providing treatment to illegal immigrants --- a significant slice of the patient population at jps and other public hospitals. ""i've never met anyone in this area that is lukewarm on this issue,"" earley said. ""we have over 6,000 births last year, and over 70 percent of them were to an undocumented population. that is a population we have to take care of."" as for rose, he said he's optimistic but also waiting to learn from doctors whether he needs to consider a bone marrow transplant. ""the bone marrow testing alone costs $300,000,"" rose told us. ""and we're not even talking about the hospital stays. that's just the testing part of it. at least that is what i am told."" in his apartment, he shows the eight prescription drug vials with his daily medications. in the window still hangs an obama-biden campaign sign. ask about the politics of health care in washington, and rose's first reflex is to blame republicans. but as the conversation continues, he voices frustration at all the recent democratic infighting over how to pay for the overhaul. ""i think they need to get their heads together,"" rose said. ""because it's really not just about republican vs. democrat anymore, it's about getting the job done. and with those majorities in place, things should be happening, especially if you're coming from the same types of ideas and backgrounds, there shouldn't be too much opposition. ... and if they don't get it done, there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be hurting because of it.""","texan gregory rose, who's uninsured, was diagnosed with leukemia at 23"
"-- in today's publishing market, ""going rogue"" is a fat book at 432 pages, at a high price point of $28.99, with a massive (rumored 1.5 million) first printing, launched on the book world's version of a royal tour, where oprah is queen of the universe and barbara walters is duchess of the d.c.-manhattan cognoscenti. in today's political market, well before it was officially released, ""going rogue"" was reduced to a pinprick-sized, petty insiders squabble. how do we square these disparate perspectives? as a person with alternating publisher and political hats, who knows the players but wasn't inside the john mccain campaign, who cares deeply about the current conservative movement and the future of the country (which are inextricably intertwined), may i offer a few thoughts to the friends on cnn.com's site? the publishing ""frenzy"" full disclosure: threshold editions, an imprint of simon and schuster, (for which i serve as editor-in-chief, a misnomer of a title, since my editing is confined to reading; for you political types, think, ""operative/organizer"") would have loved to acquire sarah palin's book. she didn't really shop it and it's not certain we would have paid what she was reputed to have commanded, but upon notice she was considering writing, we, like the rest of the book world, were in a frenzy at the prospect of publishing it. many were prepared to offer palin's lawyer, bob barnett, their first-born male child for it. we are now all watching very closely how it plays out (and more precisely, ""earns-out"") in a book market that's unpredictable and fickle always, but in major transition today. the pre-orders immediately kicked it onto the best-seller lists, but a dirty little secret of publishing (where spin is as prevalent as in politics) is not all best-sellers earn out (i.e., the publisher sells enough books to cover an author's advance, which is the threshold for making a profit). ""going rogue"" will now be a ""comp"" (or baseline) for assessing the value of and advances for political ""big books,"" so all you big book writers of the future better hope it sells big -- or your future advances won't be. ""the political palin"" on to politics. while having your own title is now de rigueur for politicians and policy makers, and the upshot is usually no harm-no foul, the goals of the publishing and political worlds are not always in tandem. though there is much, much more in palin's book that fleshes out her inner core, her grounding in faith and family, as well as her policy achievements and forward-thinking philosophical framework of common sense conservatism, so far the coverage of it has constrained her in a defensive backward-focused box, re-litigating the darkest days of the campaign and reliving difficult family moments. though all the breathless chatter about 2012 is premature, the way palin lays out her world view throughout the book and especially in the eloquent closing pages is sure to attract conservatives yearning for an unapologetic articulation of first principles. but because of the inordinate mainstream media focus on the political insiders' tiff, the political palin is getting sucked down and mucked up by the published palin. listening to her on rush limbaugh as i write, she is digging out of the box her detractors would like to bury her in for once and all and needs to keep on it: get off their message and onto her own. now, for a point of personal privilege. i have been and will continue to be an advocate of sarah palin and her principles. had i been asked about how to use her publishing opportunity to maximum political benefit, i would have proffered to palin the received wisdom of the unlikely duet of my mother and lee atwater: never burn bridges. as campaign memoirs go, ""going rogue"" napalms bridges, incinerates detractors, hoses gas on what were smoldering embers. it is without refutation anywhere, even among rabid palin haters, that she received political hazing of a magnitude previously unimaginable. more mother wisdom: two wrongs don't make a right (to which my obama-loving daughter always replies, ""yes, but three rights make a left""). there was a way to defend her honor, make her case, pivot to the future while showcasing her moral foundation by doing unto others as she wished they had done unto her, so to speak. campaign pressure cooker anyone who has ever been in the defcon one pressure cooker of a national campaign knows that ""mistakes are made,"" feelings are hurt, tempers are short, bitching is background noise. there is no such thing as emily post for political campaigns. except for maybe poppy bush, good manners do not exist on any campaign planet. for good reason: they take time. time is the most valuable commodity on a campaign and you just can't waste it thinking about how to choose your words carefully or get your job done more diplomatically. if someone isn't in tears every day, that day wasn't all it could be advancing the campaign. i once witnessed an experienced (big) man slap a professional female colleague across the face over an ad buy... and no one thought anything of it, starting with the woman. in fact, she would have been insulted if anyone told her she should have been insulted. though the two primary palin antagonists, mccain campaign senior strategists steve schmidt and nicolle wallace, have said little about the molotov cocktails thrown at them in ""going rogue"" (other than a true schmidt, aka, ""the bullet,"" retort, ""why are the bald guys always the villains?""), both have made it clear the accounts of their actions in ""going rogue"" are ""fiction."" and while i wasn't there, i have worked with and adore them both. they are uniquely talented, cool under fire, cutting-edge creative professionals, admired and respected by their peers of all political persuasions and their many high-level bosses. and ironically, however it ended, the relationship began as a match made in heaven. both steve and nicolle were ecstatic with palin's selection as vice presidential nominee; and both were appalled at the outrageous, unspeakable, unparalleled media treatment heaped on palin and her family. steve, normally the toughest guy in the room, called me at home on multiple occasions, just flabbergasted and flummoxed about how to protect palin and her family and, of course keep the campaign on track. he was in genuine pain for her -- not a good state of mind or use of energy for the campaign guru, which he knew -- but he devoted much concentration to the astounding set of circumstances. ditto for nicolle. that palin recalls her experience with them so negatively and ugly incidents so vividly does not make her a liar, as people with neither her nor the party's best interests in mind have charged. the operating principle of campaigns, perception is reality, works inside as well as outside. once her perception of reality locked in negatively, particularly on schmidt and wallace, there was only one prism through which all their actions flowed. and it wasn't pretty. i have seen this phenomenon on countless campaigns and in the white house. it is unavoidable in any operation that is always under stress, where clearing-the-air sessions aren't possible given time or physical constraints. that campaign people tend to be uncommonly focused, which can come off as insensitive, might exaggerate the perception, but it is just an occupational hazard. the plight of the number two another common source of campaign discomfort is the role of the vpotus (that's vice president of the united states) candidate. it is always secondary to the potus in every respect. his/her operation is always subservient to the principal one. they do not set strategy or adjust message; they are assigned to b markets. they are an echo chamber. they do not give unique speeches unless they are given a specific and pointed attack, which might appear unseemly coming from the principal. granted, palin was a unique nominee, with uncommon charisma and fire-power, but number two is number two. it was ever thus and will ever be. adjusting to being number two, after being number one (as a governor) is a process. even if you were never number one, it is a trial -- witness joe biden, in perpetual adjustment mode. bottom line: the book is a good read, an unusually detailed front-row seat view to how strained campaigns always are, and a compelling insight into palin's perspective. its long-term publishing and political impact are unknown for now, though as palin moves out of the mainstream media monster publicity machine and into more hospitable, relevant political terrain, the prospects for success on both fronts improve exponentially. but its impact on personal and professional relationships is a sad one indeed and one i hope conservatives don't let it divide us just when we are marching toward a promising midterm, which reflects an ascendant common-sense conservatism and requires all the good guys in the foxhole together. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of mary matalin.","palin's book is a publishing blockbuster and ""a good read,"" says mary matalin"
"-- birders define ""a big year"" as an informal competition to see who can spot the most species of birds in a certain area in a calendar year. let me start off with a disclaimer: i am a bit of a bird nerd. not a serious birder by any stretch (i have never gone on vacation specifically for the birds, for example ... well, not a long one, anyway), but my iphoto has been known to contain more than a few shots of birds, and my iphone does have ibird explorer plus. oh, and as a child, my dad and i would spend the occasional summer afternoon in the country listening to records of bird calls. however, just because i like birds doesn't mean i am predisposed to liking a movie with a lot of birds in it. i am a huge baseball fan too, but am perfectly able to recognize a bad baseball movie when i see one. ""major league 2,"" anyone? in addition, a good film needs to have something to it in addition to the surface subject matter. what i am trying to say is, just because this is a film about birding doesn't mean it's a film about birding. stu preissler (steve martin), brad harris (jack black) and kenny bostick (owen wilson) are three birders who may (or may not) be attempting a big year. the thing is, it's such a competitive field that those attempting such a feat tend to keep the information to themselves, so as to not inspire the competition. paying possum is a big part of a big year. the head of a corporation, stu is nearing retirement age. he wants to quit the rat race, do something for himself (a big year, natch) and settle down in colorado with his wife, edith (jobeth williams). of course his corporate underlings, smarmily played by kevin pollak and joel mchale, continuously try to pull him off the road and into the board room. brad, in his mid-30s and divorced, is low on funds and morale. he's stuck in a job he hates and aches to do something truly great. as a birder, this means breaking the world record held by bostick (almost always referred to by his surname with a mix of derision, awe and envy by his fellow birders). for stu and brad, while the undertaking of a big year is exciting, it's also a means to an end, not the end itself, and the journey is at least as important as the result. one of the joys of this film is watching their excitement when some el niã±o weather phenomena means that there's a likelihood of a mass of grounded birds (a storm in florida) or a super rare sighting (a pink-footed goose, rarely seen in the u.s.). to the arrogant and absurdly colorfully attired bostick, however, the big year is personal and more about him than it is about the birds. it's his record, and his status as world champion is more important to him than anything, even his devoted wife, jessica (rosamund pike). bostick is constantly promising to hang up his binoculars and start a family, only to receive a call with a rare bird sighting somewhere across the country and hit the road again. stu and brad quickly become friends and repeatedly run into each other throughout the year in far-flung parts of the continent, and travel they do. ""the big year"" takes them from maine to key west to arizona to attu island, alaska, the westernmost island in the aleutians, closer to russia than it is to the alaskan mainland (of course the production didn't actually shoot there, but they did shoot in the yukon). the scenery and wildlife on display are at times breathtaking. the thing is (up on my avian soapbox, again), i can see the appeal. after all, birds are amazing creatures. they can fly, which is amazing in and of itself, and oh, by the way, isn't one of the most common dreams the one where you're flying? add to that their place in evolution, their diversity, strength and behavioral differences, and they're pretty interesting creatures. while it's mostly about the humans in the cast, the sheer number of birds on display (stay for the running list during the closing credits) is astonishing, with some quite interesting (and in one case downright touching) bits of bird trivia thrown in. it's not hard to see how large groups of people could get caught up in the activity. in fact, a 2006 survey by the u.s. fish and wildlife department puts the number of birders nationwide at 48 million. that same year, the activity created 671,000 jobs and added $36 billion to the u.s. economy. at the heart of ""the big year"" is the idea that we all have our passions, and why are any passions any weirder than any other? surely, on a list of odd obsessions, birding ranks far below hoarding or, say, dyeing your dog to look like a panda. supporting turns are all solid, with special notice to the always lovely rashida jones as ellie, the female bird nerd who captures brad's interest, and anjelica huston as the comically and aptly named annie auklet. dianne weist and brian dennehy are perfectly cast as brad's parents. if there's ever been a non-related trio that looks more like a real family, i'll eat my special birding hat. kidding. i don't have one ... yet. ""the big year"" is a charming, uplifting and heartwarming film, and when it's funny (which is often), it's very funny indeed. it has a simple but compelling story to which everyone, birders and non-, can relate, great chemistry between martin and black, and a heart. it's nice to see a film that doesn't have a mean streak and also doesn't talk to adults like they are idiots. ""the big year"" is rated pg. there's a minor swear word or two, but that's about it.","""the big year"" stars steve martin, jack black and owen wilson"
"-- broken noses, black eyes, bent fingers -- rugby players wear their battle scars as badges of honor. ""you're never in danger of not being seen as a rugby player,"" says england's simon shaw, who at 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 meters) tall is never in danger of not being seen. ""rugby you wear on your face, basically."" after a 15-year international career, shaw has his fair share of bumps and bruises to take into his third world cup in new zealand. among the marks the game has left on his frame over the years is a classic rugby war wound, one that is increasingly rare in the modern, headgear-wearing era: a cauliflower ear. but his is a minor example compared to some former players. a bluffer's guide to rugby union england scrum coach and former player graham rowntree is naturally blessed with ears like taxi doors, but the former loosehead prop augmented them with years of hard service in front row of the scrum. as one of the ways to restart play, the set scrum is also one area of the game that can be hard to referee -- and what really goes on in there is only really known by the players themselves. but if the battle scars of rugby haven't changed much since shaw first started playing in 1990, he says that pretty much every other part of the game has been transformed. new zealand's world cup obsession professionalism, training regimes, nutritionists and physios have all combined to create the modern players' physiques. ""it amuses me that in adverts and in films that get made about rugby, often they're blokes that are overweight and with beer bellies. that's not the case anymore,"" shaw says. ""bumps and minor injuries are part and parcel of the game, given the strength and the speed of players playing now. but also guys now are conditioned more to take the hits. ""it can look worse than it is as these days there are something like 15 tv cameras trained on every game. it can even be in 3-d and you can watch it in slow motion."" that's easy for shaw to say. his enduring toughness has given him the ability to play at the highest level for over 20 years. but for armchair spectators, the hard-hitting part of rugby they find so appealing remains best sampled vicariously. ""i've played with dislocated fingers. you often get (injuries) a couple of days before a game. you just tape them up and get on with it,"" shaw says. the ultimate example of ""getting on with it"" must be former new zealand captain wayne ""buck"" shelford. in a match against france in 1986, his scrotum was ripped by an opponent's studded boot. it's a horrific injury that would make most never want to play again, but shelford went to the sideline, had it stitched up and amazingly went back on the field to play the rest of the match. shelford has said that he doesn't remember the incident or the game itself, having also been knocked out and losing a few teeth as well. rules have tightened up against dangerous play to curb stray boots and flying fists. ""the game isn't quite as ferocious nowadays,"" says shaw. ""well, basically there are not quite as many fights."" spear tackling and taking out players who are jumping for the ball are not allowed because of the potentially career or even life-threatening consequences. as well as tighter laws, having so many cameras at big matches has meant that players can't get away with any foul play behind the referee's back. certainly nothing like the organized brawl that took place on the british and irish lions tour to south africa in 1974 that has become a rugby legend. after some violent play in previous matches, lions captain willie john mcbride decided before the match in port elizabeth that his team would ""get their retaliation in first"" at the first sign of south african aggression. when ""99"" was called at a lineout, each one of the 15 lions players took a swing at an opponent, meaning the referee couldn't identify the instigator of the fight. not one player was sent off. as he looks forward to what will probably be his last international appearances, shaw has no nostalgia for the old days. the game remains tough enough without too many of the extras. ""the level of rucking (a contest for the ball after a tackle) has pretty much been eradicated from the game, which has made it a lot safer. you don't come away from a game with a road map on your back made of ruck marks.""",physical nature of rugby means that bruises and injuries are common
"-- environmental saviors can turn up in the most unexpected places. for the answer to our global waste management crisis, we need only look as far as our back gardens, for example. forty million manure worms are being put to use in sydney to treat its sewage. that's what proponents of vermicomposting will tell us, anyway. vermicomposting is the art of composting using worms -- and it is worms, apparently, who could save us yet. worms are nature's waste disposal units. or rather, it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units, as they don't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful: nutrient-rich compost. earthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly, in this context: the eisenia foetida and lumbricus rubellus, which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting, according to cityfarmer.org. not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day, but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process, according to the ecologist. there are a lot of them, too. you will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land, according to naturewatch, their population doubling in size every one-two months. and they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves, stems and dead roots in one year, ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process. what they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients. according to naturewatch, earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen, seven times as much phosphorous, 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more ""beneficial bacteria"" than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place. literally speaking, what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out. utilizing 'black gold' it is no surprise why these worms' byproducts are often referred to as ""black gold,"" this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world's agricultural soil has become ""seriously degraded,"" according to the uk soil association. worm compost: just one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days, according to sciencedaily. and plants love it. research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting, by as much as 40 percent for broccoli, 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots, according to the ecologist. according to the world waste survey, compiled by veolia environmental services, we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004. and a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted. around 32 percent of the european union's annual municipal waste (around 120 million tons) is food and garden waste, according to waste management world. and 30 percent of u.s. waste could have been composted in 2000, according to the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill, emitting methane into the atmosphere. as local governments and companies grapple with the issue of how to safely dispose of waste, vermicomposting is finding new fans -- some in unusual places. in hong kong, none other than fast-food chain mcdonald's has signed up to a vermicomposting program that will have 80 million worms feasting on between 50 and 200 tons of organic waste a day, according to the reuters news service. mcdonald's aims to decrease the amount of waste it sends to hong kong's rapidly filling landfills by 80 percent, reuters reports. other companies to have experimented with worm composting include ikea in the u.s. state of illinois, where, according to treehugger.com, it is conducting vermicomposting trials. if all goes well, it aims to use worm composting to boost its 70 percent recycling rates to 90 percent, the site says. as it happens, we have had this knowledge for centuries. aristotle himself was even said to have called worms the ""intestines of the soil,"" according to the new york times, which also points out that cleopatra was another devotee, bestowing sacred status on them and ordering them protected. charles darwin admired their land-tilling abilities so much that he wrote a book on them. ""it may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as have these lowly organized creatures,"" he mused, according to the new york times. greenhouse gas emitters what darwin, cleopatra or aristotle could not have known however, is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste. scientists in india have found that worms' digestive systems and regenerative abilities are so remarkable that they can actually absorb toxic materials yet expel toxic-free manure. according to the indian newspaper, india together, researchers in gujarat have found that worms can ""detox"" the organic parts of the industrial sludge which results from the effluent treatment of industrial or hazardous waste. the method is ideal for industries -- such as paper, food processing, oil, textiles, dairy, distilleries and agro-chemicals -- where there is large enough organic components in the industrial sludge, indian researchers say. but even with vermicomposting, something that looks like one of the most environmentally sound ideas around, there's a downside -- and it's a rather large one. it turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide. unfortunately, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, large-scale composting plants could be just as damaging to the environment as landfills of the same size, reports the uk's telegraph newspaper. ""the emissions that come from these worms can actually be 290 times more potent than carbon dioxide and 20 times more potent than methane,"" the telegraph quotes jim frederickson, an open university research fellow.

"-- two steubenville, ohio, football stars sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl, treating her ""like a toy,"" a state prosecutor said wednesday in the opening statement of the teens' rape trial. trent mays, 17, and ma'lik richmond, 16, are accused of sexually assaulting the girl at a series of end-of-summer parties in august, according to prosecutors. the case received widespread attention nationally after other steubenville teens posted images of the alleged victim seemingly unconscious to social media sites. defense attorneys say the boys are innocent of rape. mays is also charged with illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material. although they are minors, they have been identified in court by the judge and attorneys, and in newspapers and other media reports. cnn is not naming the 16-year-old girl in line with its policy of not identifying the alleged victims of sexual assault. prosecutor marianne hemmeter detailed a string of degrading abuse she said the girl suffered at the hands of the boys, including having her clothes stripped off, while other teens joked about urinating on her. she said they had ""treated her like a toy."" some of the abuse was captured in cellphone images retrieved from either the internet or their phones. one, hemmeter said, showed the girl lying naked on her side, apparently asleep, with what appeared to be semen on her stomach. hemmeter said witnesses will testify that the girl was highly intoxicated -- stumbling, slurring her speech, at times unable to walk. such impairment, hemmeter said, would be the state's focus in proving the allegations against mays and richmond, not whether the girl consented. the girl, hemmeter said, was ""too impaired to say no, too impaired to say stop."" in a brief opening statement, one of mays' defense attorneys, brian duncan, told the judge that his client did not rape the girl. ""trent mays did not rape the alleged victim, and the prosecution cannot and will not be able to establish and substantiate their claim,"" duncan said. richmond's attorney, walter madison, did not make an opening statement. six witnesses for the prosecution testified wednesday, including a 17-year-old girl who went to a party with the alleged victim. the witness said she and the girl shared a half a bottle of vodka, which they each poured into a flavored crushed ice drink. the alleged victim also had one beer, the witness said. the alleged victim seemed to get drunk very quickly, the witness said. about 12:30 a.m., the party broke up and the girl left with mays and richmond, according to the witness who said she pleaded with her not go. the witness said she didn't see her again until the next day when she picked the alleged victim up at another home. she described the girl as a ""mess"" with her shirt inside out. other witnesses said the girl appeared drunk on the night in question while she was at the second house. two police officer also testified, describing how they collected evidence. during cross examinations, the teen's lawyers' tried to poke holes in the witnesses' stories. while being quizzed by defense attorneys, at least one witness said he did not see the alleged victim drinking and he did not see mays involved in any sexual contact with the alleged victim. another witness said, during cross examination, that she saw the alleged victim bring a bottle of vodka with her to one of the end-of-summer parties in august. the case, which is being tried before judge thomas lipps without a jury, has cast an unwelcome spotlight on steubenville, a small, down-on-its-luck town along the banks of the ohio river. social media photos, video and social media messages -- some of which the prosecutor displayed wednesday in court -- are at the heart of criminal charges against mays and richmond. crime blogger alexandria goddard, a former steubenville resident, discovered and preserved many of the online messages about the case, at least some of which are now in the hands of authorities. the girl's mother also gathered some of the material from social media and brought it to authorities. one image circulated online and posted on a website maintained by anonymous, a loosely organized cooperative of activist hackers, showed the girl, dressed in a t-shirt and blue shorts, her body limp, being held hand and foot by two males who appear to be teenagers. text messages posted to social networking sites that night seemed to brag about the incident, calling the girl ""sloppy,"" making references to rape and suggesting that she had been urinated on, goddard has said. cnn has not been able to establish whether this is true. in one 12-minute video, a teenager who is not charged in the case jokes about the girl's condition, saying she must have died because she didn't move during one assault. police got involved on august 14, when the girl's mother reported the alleged assaults, according to steubenville police chief william mccafferty. the family provided a zip drive showing a twitter page, possibly with a photo, mccafferty said. unwanted spotlight the allegations -- and the shadow it has cast over the town -- have gripped the area for months. the case has attracted the attention of bloggers and even anonymous, who have questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the veracity of the investigation. rape allegations engulf town steubenville was once a thriving steel mill town. with the mills closed, the town is a shadow of its former self as some of its residents moved away to find work elsewhere and some businesses closed. today, its population is primarily blue collar with a median income between $33,000 and $34,000, well below the national average. the steubenville high school football games have long been a gathering point for residents, who point to the team's against-all-odds play that helped elevate its reputation in the state. critics have accused community leaders of trying to paper over rampant misconduct by players of the steubenville high school team and have suggested that other students took part in the assaults or failed to do enough stop them. while many residents express concern about the allegations against mays and richmond, they are also frustrated with how the town has been portrayed.

"-- in the tangled aftermath of the malaysia airlines flight 17 disaster, two narratives have emerged -- one that most of the world subscribes to, and another that russia and the rebels are pushing. in the first, mh17 was shot down by pro-russian rebels in eastern ukraine, using a sophisticated russian-built missile system. in the second, russia and the rebels suggest several different scenarios for what brought the jetliner down, some of them bordering on the bizarre. propaganda is nothing new in world politics. since the beginning of time, everyone has put their spin on the events of the day. but the word from washington about russia's take? take any information coming out of moscow ""with a very large grain of salt."" ""i would also say that these aren't competing narratives from two equally credible sources here,"" said marie harf, a u.s. state department spokeswoman. ""the russian government has repeatedly put out misinformation and propaganda throughout this conflict in ukraine, so i would caution you from saying that these are two equally credible sources, although you're happy to report it that way, but i would take issue with it."" the russian mindset, says cnn's former moscow bureau chief, loves a good story. and the russian narrative is meant to sway public opinion on who's responsible for the jet's downing. ""don't forget, the mentality of russians is to think of conspiracy theories,"" said jill dougherty. ""so when they hear something that is outrageous, they might believe it."" here are some of the stories circulating in the russian media. the russian take: the passengers were already dead rebel commander igor girkin suggested that many of mh17's passengers were corpses -- already dead -- and put aboard the 11-plus-hour flight from amsterdam to kuala lumpur. those claims were made on russia's russkaya vessna website. ""a significant number of the bodies weren't fresh,"" girkin said he'd learned, adding, their blood had been drained. he also reportedly claimed a vast amount of blood serum and medications were discovered in the wreckage. the world's take: the information contradicts the malaysia airlines passenger manifest for flight 17 that lists the 298 people who were alive when they boarded the regularly scheduled flight. for instance, dutch passenger pim de kuijer was on his way to an international aids conference in australia -- a trip that was to be followed by a backpacking excursion there. the day of the crash, de kuijer posted to his facebook page a picture of him posing beneath aviator sunglasses and sporting a large travelers' backpack. --- the russian take: a ukrainian fighter jet shot it down on the day of the crash, russia's radar system spotted a ukrainian air force jet approaching the boeing, said russian army lt. gen. andrey kartopolov. ""its standard armament includes r60 air-to-air missiles, which are capable of locking and hitting targets from 12 kilometers (7 miles) and which are guaranteed to hit the target from the distance of 5 kilometers (3 miles),"" he said. the world's take: that's a claim that ukraine has denied. and the united states and others have said the plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile. ""the russian government has a propaganda machine second to none, as these latest conspiracy theories demonstrate,"" a u.s. official told cnn. --- the russian take: putin's plane was the target according to some accounts in the russian media, mh17 was traveling along almost the same route as president vladimir putin's presidential plane, which was returning to moscow from a summit in brazil. both planes have red, white and blue markings. ""the contours of the airplanes are in general similar, the linear dimensions are also very similar and regarding the coloring, from a sufficiently long distance, they are practically identical,"" an aviation source was quoted as telling the news outlet, rt. the world's take: another russian media, the online news portal gazeta.ru, reported that putin's plane has not flown over ukrainian airspace for quite some time because of the conflict between the government and rebel forces. --- the russian take: don't believe what you read on the internet rebel leader alexander borodai has maintained for days that mh17 was shot down, just not by his forces. he said they don't have that capability. asked about the trail of evidence that contradicted him, borodai just rolled his eyes. ""it's very easy to refute it,"" borodai told cnn's chris cuomo. ""almost all information that comes over the internet is practically all lies."" the world's take: western and ukrainian intelligence say the rebels did have the means to bring down a jetliner. they were in control of a russian missile system that once belonged to the ukrainian military. a video reportedly showed the weapons system being carted out of eastern ukraine into russia. intercepted conversations brag of an aircraft being shot down before the debris showed it was a civilian aircraft. a tweet from a rebel defense minister also bragged of the accomplishment -- before it was deleted. --- the russian take: did we mention it was the ukrainians? with the stakes so high even basic information online was being changed to shape facts. the twitter site @rugovedits automatically tracks changes made by russian government sites to wikipedia. it has tracked dozens of edits from moscow to wikipedia entries about mh17. in one case, one edit that said the plane was shot down by the pro-russian rebels was changed less than an hour later by someone inside the russian government to say: ""the plane was shot down by ukrainian soldiers."" the world's take: the wikipedia entry now says the two sides are accusing each other. --- the russian take: at first, the story didn't require such heavy media coverage. russian newspapers downplayed the story just after the crash. the world's take: the downing of the malaysia airlines made headlines instantly around the world. ""the kremlin or the people that control the information, networks in russia, decide how they are going to explain something, what the general narrative will be, and that is given to radio, tv, newspapers to a certain extent, etc.,"" said dougherty. ""they essentially are told, this is what you should say."" it proved too much for one reporter, rt's sarah firth, who quit the network last week. ""i've had many times over the five years i've been at rt where i had a similar struggle and you've watched the story handled in that way. and you felt very strongly that right away the narrative is being pitched -- a very specific narrative to the detriment to the facts and accuracy in reporting."" cnn's randi kaye, miguel marquez and sarah aarthun contributed to this report.",a rebel commander says many of those on mh17 were dead before it was shot down

""today, the korean peninsula provides the world's clearest contrast between a society that is open and one that is closed; between a nation that is dynamic and growing, and a government that would rather starve its people than change,"" the president said in remarks prepared for u.s. military personnel and members of their families. obama, who made a reference to south korea's claim earlier this year that north korea sank one of its vessels, said the united states ""will never waver in our commitment to the security of the republic of korea."" north korea has another path besides pursuing nuclear weapons, obama said. ""if they choose to fulfill their international obligations and commitments to the international community, they will have the chance to offer their people lives of growing opportunity instead of crushing poverty,"" he said. obama is in south korea for thursday's opening of the g-20 summit, which will try to stabilize the world's financial markets. the president paid tribute to generations of men and women who served in the u.s. military. he praised south korean troops and americans who fought during the 1950-53 korean war. ""gentlemen, we are honored by your presence,"" obama said of korean war veterans in the audience thursday. we are grateful for your service. and the world is better off because of what you did here."" the crowd roared when the president acknowledged the 62 veterans. ""they are all standing,"" he said. ""looks like they're doing great. let's give them a hand."" obama also thanked those currently serving in south korea, saying they ""carry on the legacy of service and sacrifice."" the president later attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the yongsan war memorial. the president placed his hand on his heart before troops fired a 21-gun salute. the president's visit to seoul will include a meeting with south korean president lee myung-bak and a meeting with chinese president hu jintao. tensions about currency and trade are likely to run high at the g-20 meeting, which will be held thursday and friday in seoul, the south korean capital. officials in china and the united states have accused the other of manipulating its currency at the expense of other economies. and the g-20 has acknowledged that the global economic recovery is advancing in ""a fragile and uneven way."" widespread protests are expected at the summit, for which south korea has mobilized its largest security force ever, according to the yonhap news agency. a total of 50,000 police and riot police are being deployed, authorities told yonhap. a number of south korean union and civic groups are gearing up for large protests against the g-20, while other groups are planning unrelated rallies in hopes of drawing international media attention. protests by muslims in indonesia also preceded obama's visit there. but the president focused on the two countries' shared principles of unity and tolerance when he delivered a highly anticipated speech at the university of indonesia right before he left for south korea. in his speech, obama reflected on the four years he spent in indonesia as a child, referring to how he and his family were warmly accepted. he drew cheers when he sprinkled sayings from the local malay language, such as ""selamat datang"" -- a greeting of welcome -- and the national motto ""bhinneka tunggal ika,"" which means ""unity in diversity."" noting that malay is one of hundreds of languages of the archipelago nation, obama lauded indonesia for its spirit of inclusiveness despite its diverse population and history of dictatorship. ""but even as this land of my youth has changed in so many ways, those things that i learned to love about indonesia -- that spirit of tolerance that is written into your constitution, symbolized in your mosques and churches and temples standing alongside each other; that spirit that is embodied in your people -- that still lives on,"" he said. grappling with a troubled u.s. economy, the obama administration has highlighted the strengthening of economic and military ties during the president's 10-day asia tour. obama started his trip with a three-day stay in india, before heading to indonesia. speaking in new delhi on monday, obama said, ""we make some of the best products in the world and we want to sell them to a growing indian market."" at the seoul summit, g-20 leaders are expected to focus on the global economic recovery and mechanisms to ensure balance and sustainable growth. ""we see the g-20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda, but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the american economy,"" ben rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications said ahead of obama's asia trip. collectively, the group of 20 accounts for about 85 percent of global economic output. the 1997 asian financial crisis prompted the creation of the group. the g-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination. ""if you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of asia, the rise of individual countries within asia, is one of the defining stories of our time,"" rhodes said.",new: president obama lays wreath at war memorial

""the commission reiterates its call for immediate and unhindered access to the syrian arab republic,"" the report said. earlier this month, the united nations high commission for human rights estimated that government forces had killed at least 3,500 civilians. syria's government has consistently blamed armed gangs for the violence and said security forces are protecting the people.

""voter approval of the way police are handling terrorism is through the roof and overall approval for police in general and for (police) commissioner ray kelly is undented by criticism,"" said maurice carroll, director of the quinnipiac university polling institute. poll respondents also gave kelly a 64% approval rating for his leadership of the nypd, while mayor michael bloomberg got a 67% approval rating for the way he is handling crime. but when asked about the controversial ""stop and frisk"" tactic of police, responses were split: 59% of self-identified white voters approved of the practice, while 68% of self-identified black voters and 52% of self-identified hispanic voters disapproved. the department's ""stop and frisk"" policy has prompted its own debate over the years, with some claiming it is nothing less than racial profiling targeting minorities. critics of nypd treatment of muslims claim the police are denying muslims basic civil rights, and perpetrating ethnic and religious profiling. ""it's one of these situations where people are ok with other people being targeted with tactics they would never approve of themselves,"" said ibrahim hooper, a spokesman for the council on american-islamic relations in response to tuesday's poll. polling numbers show that most new yorkers, 54%, have a positive opinion of islam, with 65% of those polled saying mainstream islam is a peaceful religion. hooper said those numbers are positive, but added, ""our basic position is that civil and legal rights are guaranteed by the constitution, and not subject to the changing nature of public opinion in times of crisis and national security."" he added, ""i'd like to see polling data of how people felt about the internment of japanese-americans just after pearl harbor."" last month, kelly addressed reporters amid a flurry of questions about nypd tactics.

""so we got together and just did a blitz ourselves....when you're doing movie promos and there's billboards and stuff, yeah it's out there, and you know people see it. but we were getting direct responses because of twitter and facebook. it was unbelievable."" of course, a movie's number one debut is not built on tweets alone. hart credits three other diy efforts for helping catapult his film to the top of the box office: multitasking! as part of his stand-up comedy tour, hart started screening the trailer for ""think like a man"" at the beginning and ending of every set. ""because i was doing arenas, i was [performing] for 15-to-20,000 people a night. i was reaching anywhere from 60-to-90,000 people through the course of a week."" making a scene! earlier this year, hart created a media kerfuffle when he got himself ejected from the nba all-star celebrity game -- and then was still named mvp.

"lake victoria, africa's largest lake, has been plagued by water hyacinth plants for over two decades. while its flowers can be beautiful its foliage can grow to cover large swaths of the waters in a dense green mat of leaves that choke the shoreline of fish. fishermen often struggle each day for a meager catch, but an entrepreneurial weaver has found that the invasive plant can be a free source of material for the area's women who make handicrafts. ""when we make products from this hyacinth, we are empowering women economically. they become self-reliant. that means we are alleviating poverty,"" said caroline agwanda, who heads hyacinth ornaments production enterprises in kisumu, kenya. the organization, which sells products ranging from handbags to furniture, aims to give employment to disadvantaged women, youths and those with disabilities. for years, the area's weavers have used banana and sisal fibers to make their wares. they are now turning to hyacinth because of its abundance. but if the weavers' craft is flourishing, many in the local fishing community are suffering. water hyacinth grows into a thick bed of waxy leaves and violet flowers that cover the surface of the lake. it is native to south america but was introduced in africa in the late 1800s. the plant species can double its mass every five days, according to scientists. because of its dense growth, it blocks sunlight from reaching the lake's native aquatic plants, which affects fish and other marine life-- and those who make their livelihoods catching them. ""it has really affected us because the quantity of fish that we used to get from this lake has diminished,"" said jonathan opiyo, a fisherman. the difficulties faced by the fishing community are evident at the local markets, where instead of fish traders and buyers loudly haggling over prices, there are only a few quiet voices. the weavers are not even putting a dent into the sheer growth of the plant, which at the moment is particularly severe. ""it goes all the way -- the furthest you can actually see,"" said philip ochieng, a research scientist who is working with the government to mitigate the environmental problems caused by hyacinth. ""this is the biggest acreage of water hyacinth since it was first reported in lake victoria in 1992."" methods that have been tried in the past include the release of south american weevils that eat the plant, as well as machinery that shreds from the water surface. these efforts worked for a while but were not seen as a permanent solution. ochieng does not advocate the weavers' use of hyacinth, because transporting it from the lake to their homes could help the plant spread. however agwanda says she thinks the weavers could make a real contribution to the removal of the harmful plant from the lake. she would like to see support for the project and to have the resources for machinery that would help make thousands of meters of hyacinth rope each day. ""if we have like a factory somewhere, we'll be consuming a lot of hyacinth,"" agwanda said. the wares that agwanda's group creates are sold mainly in large towns across kenya. the finished items are not cheap, and some she says some locals do not appreciate the innovation of utilizing a menacing weed. ""they say, 'you normally get this hyacinth free of charge from the lake. you should sell it for 20 shilling.' they're not looking at the time and skill of coming up with new products and a competitive product,"" she said. invasive species: eat them before they eat everything",water hyacinth covers large swaths of lake victoria
"-- the world bank will support central american security efforts with $1 billion in loans for the next two years, guatemalan state media reported wednesday. that money will be in addition to $200 million the bank already has provided to different countries for fighting organized crime, the state-run guatemalan news agency reported, citing the bank's vice president for latin america and the caribbean. bank officials are among the international leaders gathered in guatemala city for a two-day regional security conference. ""in meetings of this kind i see regional leadership, international solidarity, institutional commitment and unprecedented unity among the different national and international actors, and above all, consensus,"" world bank vice president pamela cox said, according to the news agency. earlier wednesday, u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton said the united states would increase the security aid it provides to central america this year to help combat a wave of violence sweeping the region. additional u.s. funding will go toward special police units, a regional crime observatory and support to train judges and prosecutors, clinton told leaders gathered at a regional security conference in guatemala city. ""you have identified your priorities. you have set your strategy. and we will respond with almost $300 million this year, backed up by an action plan that is focused on high-impact investments to help you build new capabilities and create the reforms you need from within,"" clinton said. president barack obama pledged more than $200 million when he visited el salvador earlier this year, she said. the source of the funding was not immediately clear. on monday, assistant secretary of state arturo valenzuela told reporters clinton may announce ""repackaging"" some assistance. clinton said the united states has ""shared responsibility"" for violence in the region. ""we know the demand for drugs rests largely in my own country,"" she said. but she stressed that central american countries must lead the fight against corruption and organized crime. ""we will all be your ready partners, but we want and need to follow your lead,"" she said. several latin american leaders at the meeting said the united states must play a key role combating violence in the region. guatemalan president alvaro colom said his country was reaching the limit of its ability to fight cartels. ""eight killed per ton passing through guatemala is a lot of blood. if you pass through honduras there are 20 murders and if we add it up, a ton of cocaine has too high a human cost. we must reduce consumption and control arms,"" colom said. mexican president felipe calderon, who has repeatedly said u.s. weapons and drug demand are fueling his country's drug war, said more must be done. ""if the sale of cocaine is a market of $35 billion in the united states, according to that calculation, a good part of these billions of dollars must be used to feed the criminal organizations here,"" calderon said. ""the international aid should be at least equivalent to the flow of money in dollars that the criminals receive here to organize and to kill."" the conference is scheduled to continue thursday, when leaders are expected to hash out a more detailed regional plan. the meeting comes a week after guatemalan authorities announced a monthlong extension of the ""state of siege"" in the northern border province of peten -- a move that increases military control to crack down on organized crime in the area. colom declared the emergency measure in may after investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers on a farm in peten. authorities have said members of mexico's zetas drug cartel were responsible. the slayings provided brutal evidence of what analysts say is a dramatic spike in violence across the region as mexican drug cartels expand their reach. ""as you look at the pressure placed on mexican cartels from the u.s. side of the border, you're going to see more and more of a southbound exodus,"" said fred burton, vice president of the stratfor global intelligence agency. social and political conditions in central america provide a fertile recruiting ground for cartels, said samuel logan, founding director of southern pulse, an online information network focused on latin america. high unemployment and few jobs mean many are forced to turn to criminal activities to make ends meet, he said. ""ultimately, what it comes down to is money. in mexico, the stakes are bigger, the pots of money are bigger,"" he said. money also has allowed mexican organizations to wield significant influence with political leaders in central american countries, many of which already had a longstanding history of institutional corruption, he said. ""instead of bending over backwards, you get them to do somersaults,"" logan said. but despite the significant security problems the region faces, burton said this week's conference is a positive sign that leaders may step up efforts to stop violence. ""discussion and dialogue is better than doing nothing, so the more exchanges you have along these lines, certainly the better off you are,"" he said. cnnmexico.com, journalist patzy vasquez and cnn's catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report.",new: billion is in addition to $200 million provided for fighting organized crime

"-- after days of intense backlash from users over changes to its terms of service and privacy policy, photo-sharing service instagram has backtracked. on thursday, instagram co-founder kevin systrom said the company was switching one section of its updated terms of service back to its original text. ""because of the feedback we have heard from you, we are reverting this advertising section to the original version that has been in effect since we launched the service in october 2010,"" said systrom in a post announcing the change. on monday, the facebook-owned app updated its terms of service to say companies could pay instagram to use members' images in ads without compensating the photographers. instagram claimed the update was to allow the company to experiment with possible future advertising options, and was not part of any current plan to sell images. ""going forward, rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed, we are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work,"" systrom said in thursday's post. opinion: instagram users should wise up it is not a complete reversal. many of the other changes to the terms of service and privacy policy remain. the company still needs to work on ways to integrate ads into its free service, but for now it will tinker behind the scenes instead of prematurely sending users into a panic over the possibility that their likeness could show up in advertisements on the network. the old advertising section that has been reinstated still says the company can place ads on the service and that ""the manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you,"" leaving the company with some wiggle room for future changes. this announcement comes two days after another mea culpa post by systrom, in which he apologized for the confusion and reassured instagram users that they still owned their images and that the company was hearing the feedback loud and clear. the severity of users' reactions to the change seemed to catch instagram off guard, though the cycle of a policy change announcement followed by user backlash and then an apology is familiar territory for its parent company, facebook.",instagram has reverted part of its terms of service in response to user backlash
"-- imagine a future passenger experience. one that considers both consumer needs and trends in society. one that draws from the next generation of technologies that are changing the flying game. one in which the flying experience reflects air transport's environmental responsibility and thus looks for inspiration from nature. this is what airbus designers are busy imagining with the airbus concept cabin: a holistic, future-oriented approach inspired by nature. i discussed this in a ted talk i delivered at tedglobal this past june. the approach is presented in our award-winning ""flying green experience"" showcase in hamburg and the amazing autodesk gallery in san francisco. these demos offer a platform for discussion and the growth of fresh ideas -- ideas about eco-efficiency combined with eco-effectiveness, and aimed at making sustainability not just another buzzword but something that makes future cabin innovations worth doing. when looking at future trends in society, we see a couple of core developments shaping the kinds of passengers that will fly and what they will expect. for instance, women are projected to account for more than 70% of higher-educated students in the uk and for an average of 59% across the nations of the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) by 2025. more women business travelers will mean more of a desire for privacy in a very dense area like an aircraft cabin. the graying members of society will have their own requirements: better accessibility to services on board during flights and less stress during boarding and deboarding. the list goes on: tall passengers would like more seat pitch, and obese passengers simply need more seat width to enjoy their flight. of course, we already have female travelers, old and obese people on board. but in the future passenger landscape, how well their travel needs can be accommodated will have a decisive impact on how they choose to spend their vacation and which vehicle they use to get there. their growing awareness of the human impact on the environment will cause them to take responsibility for how they travel. and there could be a time when some are asked to pay a fee for greenhouse gas emissions. passengers may ultimately select airlines based on their environmental profile, not only by the ticket price. as we envisioned our future air transportation we needed to consider how technology could help us to combine both passenger comfort and operational efficiency. we consulted technology experts, futurists and also experts from other industries for their insights, while staying close to our philosophy: ""inspired by nature."" for starters, weight reduction is of course key in the aviation industry, and plays a role in improving the environmental profile of the aircraft. it's not enough to build the plane with biodegradable eco-materials if they don't reduce its weight. but airframe structures are already very efficient in terms of weight and structural performance. how to improve this further, then? one way would be to remove all windows and replace them with ""digital windows"" or simply displays. but we wanted to look for other weight-reducing solutions that enhanced the passenger experience. thus we came along with structures that are inspired by such things as bird bones, trees and plants. a concrete example: slime mold -- a single-celled organism that lives in soil and can spread rapidly -- creates very efficient redundant structures. this behavior can be transformed in mathematical equations which are implemented into software. using it, we ""create"" structures that are very light and stable at the same time. another example of inspiration for strong, light structure is the water lily ""victoria regia"" which creates very large leaves that float like pie plates on the water, stable enough for kids to sit on. nature is full of similar examples and therefore it is in our interest to preserve its natural diversity. we understand nature as an open space from which to get fresh ideas. we came up with a portfolio of technologies that would help us turn the ideas into something usable and eco-friendly. it included direct manufacturing, fiber optics for data transmission and the idea of transparent glass fiber reinforced polymer (gfpr) as a strong and unorthodox material for the aircraft's outer shell. we were trying to determine how different technologies might evolve in context to others -- important, because only if you understand certain technologies and their huge potential are you able to pick the appropriate ones. then we used this portfolio of technologies in the context of passenger needs to rethink the traditional class system in the aircraft. our concept plane has three different zones. first we put our focus on the entrance area with wide central doors, ""active surfaces"" and shape-changing materials. this helped us to create a space which is entirely customizable and transformable during the flight. as a passenger you won't need to stay in the galley during the flight anymore, when you wish to stand for a while. you will meet other passenger in this ""interaction zone"" to share your thoughts, play digital sports or just have a drink together. for the airliner, or customers, new business opportunities come along with this. the interaction zone divides the cabin into two other sections: the ""smart tech zone"" and the ""vitalizing zone."" the smart tech zone, which is located in the aft fuselage, is focused on business travelers and people who like to use the latest technologies. it could also feature seating options -- seats that change shape, have increased pitch and even rows that fold up when they're empty. the vitalizing zone is the big highlight of the concept cabin. it responds to passengers' behavior by tracking their well-being through sensors that can recognize gestures and could perhaps even determine when a passenger is, for example, dehydrated. it could also afford an impressive 360-degree outside view through translucent ceiling and walls. as a consequence we had to relocate the cockpit to the cargo bay. yes, in the future we consider that pilots are still important. you might think that these guys just produced some inspiring pictures of cool, nature-inspired aircraft and futuristic, high-tech interiors. or maybe you find our concept cabin disturbing and you never would believe that this might even become reality from the technical perspective. or maybe you only would be afraid to imagine sitting as a passenger under a transparent roof while flying at an altitude of 30,000 feet. but the core objective is not to consider whether this imagined future is the only way to go, but to paint a picture of the future -- based on scientific trends and technology research -- so that we can understand the core driving forces for air travel and point towards potential solutions. you need a picture to make that potential future tangible. you need a story about the future -- with images to go along with it -- to help extend the imagination. it's how you turn critical reflection on how to use the technology into a vision of aviation that pushes the boundaries even further. see-through cabins and passenger pods: is this the future of flight?

"(cnn)raymond heiber estimates he has told this story 100 times. he'll never get tired of telling people about the forces that brought him to his soul mate at 51. the story begins in 1969, when raymond walked down the aisle with helen klinger for the first time. they were the ring bearer and flower girl in the wedding of raymond's uncle, ron, and helen's oldest sister, charlotte. ray was about to turn 6, and helen was 7. after the wedding, they remained childhood playmates, meeting up at family picnics and pool parties in the coal region of pennsylvania where they lived. but by the time they were teenagers, their lives took different directions. helen married young and had four children. raymond joined the navy, married and had a son. things didn't work out how either of them planned. raymond's wife died of lung cancer after 30 years of marriage, and helen's marriage ended in divorce. in early 2014, they were both on their own again, living 50 miles apart in lancaster county, pennsylvania. ""all she wanted in her life was for someone to love her, for her,"" raymond said. ""and the way i was left, all i wanted was to love somebody for one more day."" that's when what they like to call the ""divine conspiracy"" began. ron and charlotte, now living in las vegas, traveled back to pennsylvania in may to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary. thinking of the couple, knowing they each could use a companion, charlotte suggested raymond give helen a call, just to talk. he was nervous. ""he said, 'it's been years, i don't even know if she would know me anymore,' "" charlotte remembers. raymond called helen a week later. you can probably guess what happened after that. ""things just fit together -- there was no real working stuff out. the whole thing was very easy. the families knew each other, i knew her brothers, i knew her sisters, she knows my whole family and everything just worked out,"" raymond said. helen, who says raymond had appeared to her in a dream weeks before they reconnected, looks at the picture of him and her as ring bearer and flower girl and believes they had a spiritual connection even then. sometimes, they wonder why they didn't get married all those years ago, but they believe god truly did have a plan. from ring bearer and flower girl to husband and wife, 20 years later ""if his wife wouldn't have passed away and i hadn't got divorced, we probably wouldn't have met again,"" said helen, who just turned 53. ""i think he was supposed to go through that experience, just like i was supposed to go through my experience to be a better person."" after dating for four months, they walked down the aisle for the second time on september 14, 2014, to become husband and wife. this time, the roles were reversed: ray's uncle carried the rings and helen's sister carried the flowers.",raymond heiber and helen klinger first walked down the aisle in 1969

"-- english cricketer kevin pietersen has reached an agreement with the england & wales cricket board (ecb) which paves the way for his return to the national team. arguably england's most naturally talented cricketer, pietersen was dropped by selectors in august after it emerged he had sent ""provocative"" text messages to south africa's players during a recent test series between the two teams. however the south-african born pietersen must undergo a ""reintegration program"", before england team director andy flower can pick him.

"-- foreign aid, a topic often overlooked on the presidential campaign trail, seems to sport a giant bull's-eye among republicans this election season. gop presidential hopeful rick perry proposed setting foreign aid accounts to zero if elected. one of his opponents, mitt romney, suggested last month that china should bear more responsibility for direct humanitarian aid abroad, instead of collecting interest on loans to the united states. these candidates and others imply that cutting this one-line item is the key to balancing our federal budget and a near panacea for economic woes at home. understandably, gop candidates have focused inward in their stump speeches, promising to create jobs and stimulate our sluggish economy. americans rightly are worried about their own livelihoods and bank accounts. in tuesday's gop debate being aired on cnn, i urge the presidential candidates not to dismiss the lifesaving work done overseas by nonprofit organizations such as those i represent. not only is helping others part of this country's moral fabric, but it also makes fiscal sense for the united states and, thus, for voters' wallets. just as americans' systematically examine their own family's spending decisions, i suggest that gop presidential candidates apply similar personal finance principles to evaluate why foreign aid is worth the investment. don't be penny wise but pound foolish emergencies and disasters are inevitable -- from natural calamities to catastrophic illness. financially savvy americans know to protect their assets by spending small amounts on insurance and other precautionary measures. foreign aid is this nation's insurance. first, the investment -- like an insurance premium -- is relatively small. foreign aid comprises less than 1% of the federal budget. secondly, experts agree that small cash outlays can prevent major expenses later. for example, droughts happen everywhere -- from texas to east africa. what is not inevitable, however, is famine. in places such as texas, ethiopia and kenya, investments in agriculture techniques, good storage facilities and infrastructure have allowed people to plan for the unexpected. the texas drought, which affected 70% of the state, did have a ripple effect on food and cotton prices worldwide. but no texans starved to death. similarly, in east africa earlier this year, long-term farming and food infrastructure investments in ethiopia and kenya meant that this year's drought in these countries was far less catastrophic. in somalia, by contrast, the famine has put the lives of millions at risk. invest wisely and enjoy significant returns history shows us that investing in today's aid recipients will help convert them to tomorrow's consumers of american exports. eleven of the 15 largest importers of american goods and services are former recipients of u.s. foreign aid -- including south korea, taiwan and brazil. in today's increasingly global economy, experts agree that the united states will not recover from the great recession on its own. the u.s. department of commerce estimates that for every $1 billion in goods the u.s. exports, 6,000 manufacturing jobs are supported here at home. and 95% of the world's consumers live outside the united states. research released in october by the african development bank shows that africa's income is expected to triple in the next 50 years, and that most african countries ""will attain upper middle income status"" by then. all these individuals are potential consumers of american goods. always hunt for bargains for necessary items and services, bargain hunting pays off. foreign aid's real price tag is a bargain compared with what it's worth to taxpayers. year after year, polling shows that americans are willing to spend 10 times what the government now allocates to foreign aid. the majority think humanitarian aid and development programs eat up 25% of the federal budget, and then settle on 10% as an appropriate amount. and yet the real amount is less than 1% -- a bargain. five former secretaries of state -- from henry kissinger to condoleezza rice -- last week expressed their support for funding the international affairs budget not only as ""strategic investments in our nation's security and prosperity,"" but also to ""demonstrate america's proud tradition of goodwill and global leadership."" americans have always shown tremendous generosity even in tough economic times. more americans donated to haiti earthquake relief efforts than watched the super bowl last year. giving usa reports that giving by individuals is on the rise -- up 2.7% in 2010 over the previous year. and the biggest percentage increase in donations went to charities involved in international affairs: a 15% increase. no presidential candidate wants to be out of touch with voters. i urge gop candidates to frame their position on foreign aid based on what americans want: to safeguard their wallets and show compassion for people suffering overseas. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of samuel a. worthington.","gop presidential hopefuls are targeting foreign aid, says samuel a. worthington"
"it was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. an aerial endeavor that would take 17-year-old pilot haris suleman and his father, babar, around the world in just 30 days and into the record books. the journey, months in the planning, would take the pair on a 26,500-mile odyssey, with 25 stops planned in 15 countries. the aim was to raise funds for a charity in pakistan that helps poverty-stricken children go to school. instead, the american teenager is now confirmed dead and his father is missing after their plane crashed into the ocean off american samoa on tuesday night. haris had been due home in indiana on saturday, his sister hiba suleman told reporters wednesday. his body has been recovered, she said. but their father, also a pilot, has not been found. ""we're hoping my dad is alive and well, and we're going to keep praying until we have a definitive answer,"" hiba suleman said. she told reporters the plane was about 23 miles from the island when it crashed. her father wouldn't have let haris take off if the weather was bad, she said. it is unclear why the plane crashed or why the duo took off at night. ""he was doing something that he loved. he was doing something adventurous,"" she said of her brother, who received his pilot's license in june. and he was doing it for a good cause, she added. read more from cnn affiliate wthr 'on my bucket list forever' in an interview with cnn affiliate wish tv last month, only days before the pair set off, haris appeared excited as he outlined their itinerary -- which if completed in 30 days in their single-engine plane would have made him the youngest pilot to achieve the feat. he also told how he and his father had received survival training in case of having to ditch their plane in the water. babar suleman, asked about the inherent risk involved in such a venture, said he put his faith in sound preparations. ""in all these endeavors, the biggest part of the whole thing is the planning,"" he said. ""while he was training and getting his license, i was busy planning all the different segments, all the different fuel stops, different cruise profiles. i set up all of the plans and he will do all the execution."" the record-breaking attempt, he said, ""has been on my bucket list forever."" babar suleman also spoke of the importance of the work done by the seeds of learning charity, an indiana group which supports the work of the citizens foundation in pakistan. the money raised, he said, would help open schools ""for underprivileged children who otherwise would not have a hope of getting an education and may even end up in the wrong hands."" he expanded on his charitable motivation for the trip in his blog, around the world in 30 days, explaining how in the wake of the september 11, 2001, attacks in the united states he had come to the conclusion ""that lack of proper education contributed to the events of that day."" the work of the citizens foundation to provide education to thousands of impoverished pakistani children is, he said, ""the noblest of all causes."" the last entry on the blog is posted from bali, indonesia. 'huge heart' the principal of the high school where haris was a rising senior said the school was deeply saddened by his death. ""haris' adventurous spirit and huge heart led him to reaching for this personal goal while also seeking to raise funds and awareness for schools supported by the citizens foundation, a nonprofit organization headquartered in karachi, pakistan,"" said melvin siefert, principal of plainfield high school. a soccer coach at the school told the indianapolis star that haris was a great student and a talented player. ""haris loved to joke a lot,"" david knueve told the newspaper. ""he just got the team sort of laughing at the right moments."" his sister said haris planned to be an engineer like his father. the oldest sibling, a brother, was trying to get from london to american samoa to pick up haris' body but there were only a few flights, hiba suleman said. emergency beacons a coast guard spokeswoman, petty officer melissa mckenzie, said a plane would aid in the search for babar suleman. he and haris were wearing ""gumby"" suits that could help them survive a water landing, hiba suleman said. she said they had taken a course in how to survive a crash in the ocean. they also had life rafts aboard. the next legs of the trip were supposed to cross the pacific ocean, with stops in kiritimati (also known as christmas island) and hawaii. the plane has yet to be recovered, but emergency beacons were sending out signals. the national transportation safety board said the plane was a beechcraft bonanza a36. teen attempts record-setting solo flight around the world dutch teen completes historic, controversial solo sail around the globe",coach says young pilot was a soccer player who had a knack for when to tell joke
"-- it was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week the singapore airline-owned a380 completed its maiden passenger journey between singapore and sydney. making history: the first double bed on a commercial jet on board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. this was a turning point in aviation history as airbus' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft. and the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration. singapore airlines' ceo, chew choon seng named the jetliner the ""queen of the skies"". tom enders, ceo of airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds. and cnn's richard quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was ""nothing quite like it"". the luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel. it's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. but the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the singapore airlines a380 is its ''beyond first class"" cabins. behind the sliding doors of the singapore airlines suites, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading french yacht designer, jean-jacques coste. there's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed. this is two meters long with givenchy duvets and cushions. and for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds. from bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen lcd. laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a usb ports and access a suite of office tools on singapore airlines' in-flight entertainment system. celebrity chefs including britain's gordon ramsay and georges blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off givenchy tableware. unlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future a380s, singapore airlines has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money. as chew choon seng, ceo of singapore airlines reminded reporters last week, the first boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide. singapore airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion. the second is due to arrive next february with further deliveries later in 2008. tickets for the a380's first return commercial flight between singapore and sydney were sold at auction on ebay. one passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000. the $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in singapore, sydney and a global humanitarian organization. from sunday 28 october, singapore airlines will commence its scheduled service between singapore and sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction. the jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between singapore and london's heathrow airport. it's been a long road to this point for airbus, but the journey is by no means over. the airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below). next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010. tom enders, airbus' ceo doesn't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead. ""this is not a piece of cake,"" he told cnn, ""but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers."" it hasn't just been airbus that has been frantically preparing for the a380 launch. airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks. seventy airports are now ready, airbus has said. singapore's changi airport, home to the singapore airlines a380 fleet, was the first, and when its new terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be a380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks. heathrow's new terminal 5 will be able to handle four a380s at one time. british airways, the terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants baa to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to terminal 5 to accommodate them. as willie walsh, ba's ceo told cnn, ""we want to make sure that development is built with the a380 in mind."" but whether the arrival of the a380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided. as cnn's richard quest points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as boeing's up-coming 787 dreamliner. as richard quest says, ""there's no doubt the a380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount airbus needs to make money."" but those worries, he adds, are for another day. thursday was a day for celebration. some key figures orders total: 185 orders (165 firm orders) 15 customers emirates: 47 qantas: 20 singapore airlines: 19 lufthansa: 15 air france: 12 british airways: 12 ilfc: 10 emirates: 8 virgin atlantic: 6 thai airways: 6 malaysia airlines: 6 qatar: 5 kingfisher: 5 korean air: 5 china southern: 5 etihad: 4 delivery schedule 1 in 2007 13 in 2008 25 in 2009 45 in 2010 the aircraft wingspan: 79.8 meters (747 - 64.4 meters) length: 73 meters or seven london buses in a row (747 - 70.7 meters) height: 24.1 meters (747 - 19.4 meters) internal cabin width: 6.58 meters (747 - 6.1 meters) seats: 555 (747 - 416) flight range: 15,000 kilometers (747 - 13,450 kilometers) wiring: 500 kilometers ideal routes sin-lhr dxb-lhr syd-lax cdg-nrt jfk-nrt ticket sales for maiden passenger trip between singapore and sydney top ticket price: us$100,380 the bargain: us$560 for a single economy seat e-mail to a friend",singapore airlines a380 superjumbo completes historic maiden flight

""two brilliant goals, a genuine world-class player,"" stated liverpool manager brendan rodgers, to the club website. suarez might have had a hat-trick, too, had he shot on goal instead of setting up raheem sterling on a two-man break saturday. suarez now has 19 league goals this season -- despite missing the first six matches of the campaign due to a ban. that's more than cristiano ronaldo, lionel messi and diego costa. his goals-per-game ratio in the league is also better than the high-profile trio, who ply their trade in spain's la liga. if suarez keeps up his impressive pace, he will smash the record for most goals in a premier league season. suarez, deputizing as captain for the still injured steven gerrard, opened the scoring when he volleyed jordan henderson's chipped pass past david marshall in the 25th minute. he unselfishly assisted on sterling's tap in three minutes before the interval and made it 3-0 with a curled effort across goal in the 45th. liverpool struck the bar twice in the first half, with marshall thwarting sterling. cardiff pulled a goal back through jordon mutch's header in the 58th minute during a brief spell of superiority but liverpool soon reasserted its control and suarez hit the outside of the post on a rebound. ""we played very well in the first half and in the second half not as well,"" suarez told bt sport. ""but most important was that we won."" liverpool leads arsenal by a point, though the gunners can reclaim first spot monday against chelsea. manchester city later went ahead of arsenal on goal difference following a 4-2 win at fulham and defending champion manchester united ended a two-game league losing streak at home by downing west ham 3-1 in a battle of teams who this week progressed to the last four of the league cup. liverpool visits manchester city -- a perfect 8-0-0 at home with 35 goals scored -- in boxing day's standout clash. ""we have been on a fantastic run,"" said rodgers. ""the quality of our football is at a really high level. we're pressing the game very well, our aggression to get the ball back is good. ""we'll arrive there on boxing day in a really good moment. it's a game i'm really looking forward to."" manchester city has struggled away from home and looked like it might drop more points playing without injured striker sergio aguero after seeing a 2-0 lead turn to 2-2. but late goals by substitutes jesus navas and james milner bailed out city. ashley young, another substitute, scored for the second consecutive game to add to first-half strikes for danny welbeck and adnan januzaj at old trafford. united overtook idle tottenham for seventh. newly promoted cardiff stayed above the relegation zone but it may not be enough to prevent manager malky mackay from being dismissed by owner vincent tan. tan -- in attendance at anfield -- is reportedly dismayed by the amount of money mackay spent on players in the off-season and wanted the former scotland defender to resign. ""i won't be walking away,"" mackay told bt sport.

"-- a deadly explosion on a bus carrying israeli tourists outside an airport in bulgaria was ""clearly a terrorist attack,"" israeli defense minister ehud barak said wednesday. key israeli politicians pointed to iran as the likely instigator, but israel's u.s. ambassador acknowledged they had no proof. vania valkova, director of the bulgarian interior ministry press office, said that at least seven people were killed and about 30 wounded in the explosion in a parking lot outside burgas airport, on the black sea. the foreign ministry said six died and 32 people were wounded, with three in intensive care. the attack was probably initiated by a group under the auspices of ""either iran or other radical muslim groups,"" according to barak, who cited hezbollah and hamas as likely suspects. ""we are in a continued fight against them. we are determined to identify who sent them, who executed (the attack) and to settle the account,"" barak said. bulgaria's foreign minister, nikolay mladenov, told cnn he presumes the explosion was a terrorist attack. but he said it was not time to ""starting assigning blame."" bulgaria will ask the u.n. security council to condemn the attack, perhaps thursday, said mladenov, who traveled to the blast scene. the bus was scheduled to carry about 47 passengers to a resort. bulgaria is a popular destination for israelis. another spokeswoman for the interior ministry said an explosive device may have been on the bus, but authorities cannot be sure. a forensic team has begun an investigation, she said. israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu pointed to iran, saying it has been behind a string of recent attempted attacks on israelis in thailand, india and georgia, among others. ""all the signs (are) leading to iran,"" he said, according to a statement from his office. ""this is a global iranian terror onslaught and israel will react firmly to it."" michael oren, israel's ambassador to the united states, said his country was investigating the circumstances. ""we don't have proof of iranian involvement but it is part of this pattern"" of plots around the world, he told cnn's ""the situation room."" the iranian government had no immediate comment on the incident. read netanyahu's full statement bulgarian authorities also vowed to find out what happened. israel's intelligence minister told cnn's christiane amanpour that israel has ""very good indications"" iran was involved. ""they are after us, israelis, wherever they can find them,"" said dan meridor. venelin petkov, a reporter for btv in bulgaria, said that three of the wounded were in critical condition. the bulgarian bus driver was among the dead, according to valkova of the bulgarian interior ministry. the israelis had just arrived from tel aviv and were to have traveled to a beach resort about 50 kilometers (30 miles) away, he said. security expert ivan boyadjiev told bulgarian national television that israel had warned several months ago of the possibility of an attack on israelis in bulgaria. bulgarian president rosen plevneliev said he met the head of mossad, israel's intelligence service, about two months ago. ""if we'd received any kind of information about this, it would have been taken very seriously,"" he told reporters. ""the fact that such an attack was carried out here and now should not be interpreted as to say that bulgaria is not a safe country for tourists."" bulgarian interior minister tsvetan tsvetanov said he was not excluding the possibility that the explosion was a terrorist attack. ""i can assure you that we're doing all we can to strengthen security in all the areas where it might be necessary to do so,"" he said. u.s. president barack obama condemned what he called a ""barbaric terrorist attack."" ""as israel has tragically once more been a target of terrorism, the united states reaffirms our unshakeable commitment to israel's security, and our deep friendship and solidarity with the israeli people,"" said obama, who called netanyahu to express his condolences. u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton said the united states was prepared to assist bulgaria and israel in bringing those responsible to justice. neither she nor obama mentioned iran in their statements. the tourists' plane from tel aviv landed in bulgaria at 5 p.m., the israeli foreign ministry said. the flight carried 154 passengers, eight of them children. oren katz, who was with his wife and three children on a bus near the one that blew up, described a bloody scene. ""the moment we got on (the bus), we heard a very loud explosion. it was the third bus next to us. everyone started running in all directions. there was a big chaos,"" he said. ""we took our children with us and ran as far as we could away from the explosion. my oldest daughter is handicapped, so i decided to run back in order to pick up her wheelchair. ""there was a big blaze of fire, and we were not allowed to come near. suddenly, i noticed an unconscious woman laying next to me, very close to the burning bus. i picked her up together with another man, and we managed to drag her out of the fire that was about to catch her body in seconds. ""i cannot forget the sight of body parts scattered around the bus."" the travelers were on seven buses outside the terminal; they had arrived on the same flight from israel, katz said. the israeli military said it would send a medical team to bulgaria, which oren called a hospitable vacation destination. bulgarian president rossen plevneliev: ""the fact that such an attack was carried out here and now should not be interpreted as to say that bulgaria is not a safe country for tourists,"" said * the explosion came on the 18th anniversary of an attack on a jewish community center in the argentinian capital, buenos aires, in which 85 people were killed. argentina's top prosecutor last year blamed iran for the 1994 attack, which also wounded about 300 people. israel also holds iran responsible for the attack; tehran has denied any connection to the bombing, which it has condemned. tension between iran and israel has increased over the past year. iran hanged a man who was convicted of killing one of its nuclear scientists, state-run press tv reported in may. majid jamali fashi was convicted of the january 2010 killing of massoud ali mohammadi, an iranian university professor and a nuclear scientist. he was also convicted of spying. prosecutors accused him of working for the mossad, and said he was paid $120,000 by israel to carry out the hit. israel typically does not comment on such claims. the killing was among a series of attacks against iranian nuclear scientists in recent years. in january, iran sent a letter to the united nations secretary-general alleging that the killings of the scientists were terrorist attacks that followed a pattern. ""there is firm evidence that certain foreign quarters are behind such assassinations,"" the letter said. iran's efforts to build a nuclear program have unnerved many world leaders, resulting in condemnation and sanctions from the united nations. tehran insists the program is for peaceful purposes. israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and has expressed alarm over tehran's hostility toward the jewish state, has said it may attack iran to try to stop the country from developing nuclear weapons. did you witness the blast? share what you've seen. cnn's guy azriel, raja razek, stephanie halasz, ralitsa vassileva, jill dougherty, and jennifer deaton contributed to this report.","death toll reaches seven, bulgarian interior ministry says"

"(cnn)atletico madrid stunned their city rivals real after thrashing them 4-0 in what must count as one of the most humiliating derby defeats in recent memory. the spanish champions took a first half lead after real's goalkeeper iker casillas fumbled tiago's shot into his own net. although there was little casillias could do about saul niguez's stunning overhead kick that gave atletico a 2-0 halftime lead. the visitors had hoped to cement their strong position in this season's title battle with the return of cristiano ronaldo, who had been suspended for two matches following a sending off last month. but atletico pushed on in the second half with goals from antoine griezmann and mario mandzukic sealing a historic derby day victory. atletico are now unbeaten against real in six matches. angry ancelotti ""it is easy to analyze this game because atletico were better in every facet of the game: they fought more, had more quality on the ball, had better organization, everything,"" real madrid coach carlo ancelotti told afp after the match, calling it ""the worst game we have played since i have been coach.""

"some iphone 5 users are complaining that a burst of purple is showing up in their photos -- and apple seems to be acknowledging it's just part of how the camera works. since apple's new smartphone was released just over a week ago, some of the millions of users have reported that, when a strong source of light is present in their photographs, the light takes on a purple hue. the problem was first noted on the forums of online computer magazine anandtech, where a thread discussing the issue had more than 180 comments wednesday. ""yeah, i have a feeling this is going to be antennagate all over again,"" one forum member wrote, referencing antenna problems with the iphone 4. ""i've taken 20,000+ photos on my 4s, never once had this problem."" that user then posted two photos that appear to show the flare. an e-mail from apple appears to confirm that the purple haze isn't all in users' minds. tech blog gizmodo quoted an e-mail from apple support to a reader. he claims apple support staff first said the discoloration shouldn't be happening but shifted after talking to apple engineers. ""our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures,"" read the e-mail, as reported by gizmodo. ""the purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iphone 5's camera."" apple did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. a comparison by mashable, a cnn content partner, studied similar images taken with an iphone 5, an iphone 4s and a nikon d300. some of the 5's images had a purple glow around light sources, while others didn't, mashable reported. none of the images from the other two devices displayed the flares. some have speculated that the problem is caused by a sapphire cover that apple added to the phone's camera. ""the new isight camera in iphone 5 features a sapphire crystal lens cover that is thinner and more durable than standard glass with the ability to provide crystal clear images,"" apple wrote in promotional material for the phone. the iphone 5 has been apple's biggest launch to date, selling 2 million units in the first 24 hours and 5 million over its first weekend on the market. but with its popularity have come a handful of persistent complaints, the purple glow being the most recent to gain traction. foremost have been problems with apple's new maps feature, which for the first time replaced google maps as the default mapping software on apple's mobile operating system. the problems -- landmarks misplaced or misnamed, huge swaths of major cities missing -- prompted apple ceo tim cook to offer a rare apology, promising that it will be fixed and going so far as to suggest other apps in the meantime. other iphone 5 complaints have ranged from its aluminum casing scratching easily to light leaking from openings on the phone. death by theft, water and gravity: smartphone horror stories",iphone 5 uses complain about purple flare on photos

"-- on september 11, 2001, when thousands of innocent men and women lost their lives, tens of thousands more came to their assistance. we as a nation saw greater acts of heroism than we could have imagined: first responders from all over new york and all over the country came to ground zero to save lives, provide proper burial for lives that were lost and assist in the enormous effort to clean up and recover from that devastating attack on our nation. tragically, in the nine years since the attack, more than 30,000 responders and survivors from across the country have had to be medically treated because of their exposure to ground zero toxins. they are waiting for congress to pass legislation to ensure that they can continue to get the care they need. our 9/11 heroes didn't think twice that day. bound by duty, a love of our nation and their fellow americans, they joined hand in hand with heroes from every corner of america to come to our rescue. now, it's long past time we came to theirs. nine years ago, no one could have imagined that our nation would ignore our duty to the 9/11 heroes. nine years ago, no one could have imagined that our country would leave these heroes behind. the james zadroga 9/11 health and compensation act would finally provide monitoring and treatment for world trade center responders and community members who are suffering, and for those who traveled to ground zero from all across america. the legislation would establish the world trade center health program within the national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) to provide permanent medical monitoring and treatment for wtc-related conditions to responders and community members. the program administrator will establish a nationwide network of providers so that eligible individuals who live outside of the new york area can reasonably access monitoring and treatment benefits where they live. these eligible individuals are included in the caps on the number of participants in the responder and community programs. one often overlooked aspect of the legislation is its level of accountability and transparency for the disbursement funds. it will terminate the six billing systems created in the chaotic aftermath of september 11, and establish a third-party administrator, who will set reasonable rates, track expenditures and enforce eligibility requirements. and the legislation reopens the september 11 victim compensation fund to cover economic damages and losses for individuals who became ill after the original december 22, 2003 deadline. the bottom line is that this should not be a partisan fight. we have an undeniable, moral obligation to provide our 9/11 heroes with all the care they need. heroes like nypd officer robert helmke, who died from stage iv metastatic colorectal cancer caused by inhaling and swallowing toxins at ground zero. he was 43. robert worked many tours of duty at ground zero. he ate food and unknowingly inhaled toxic substances while working. at no time while working at ground zero was he instructed to wear a breathing apparatus, nor was he told that the air was unhealthy. stage iv metastatic colorectal cancer is a form of cancer in the upper gi tract, and it is very rare to see it in a man so young. he was told that treatment would not cure him, only help him live longer. in his own words, he reacted to his diagnosis: ""talk about crushing news! my wife and i sat in the car and cried, and i asked her what did i ever do to deserve this. ""on july 11th, 2006, i had major surgery to remove two tumorous parts of my small colon and have radiation on the large tumor in my liver. before my surgery, i had four chemotherapy treatments, and was in the emergency room three times to be treated for dehydration before finally having to go on an all-liquid diet and intravenous feeding. ""i have a wife, greta, and two young children, garrett and amelia, who have seen my health worsen since participating in the wtc recovery. my favorite things in life are slowly being taken away from me. my work, food, helping others and caring for my family."" officer helmke died on july 28, 2007. and the longer we delay this bill, the more heroes like officer helmke we risk losing. the u.s. house of representatives passed this bill in september and now it's time to keep our promise to 9/11 heroes and pass this bill in the u.s. senate. we can't afford to wait any longer. i'm urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what they know is right and support this legislation. republican leaders from around the country have stepped forward, including former republican presidential candidates. former new york city mayor rudy giuliani said, ""this is something that most americans want. something that republicans like me want. these are people, after all, who were hurt and harmed because of the worst attack in the history of this country. they're entitled to more consideration than this."" and former arkansas gov. mike huckabee said, ""every republican should vote for this bill."" the men and women who lived through and came to our rescue on 9/11 were not democrats or republicans or independents. they were americans first and foremost, and so were the people they saved. it's time for us in congress to honor their sacrifices by coming together as americans and keeping our promise to provide them with the care they need to save their lives. the opinions in this commentary are solely those of kirsten gillibrand.","kirsten gillibrand: thousands lost lives on 9/11, and tens of thousands came to help"
"-- for alex zanardi, losing both legs in a life-threatening crash was only the beginning of a new chapter. this year, the italian racing driver, who has competed in formula one and indycar series, added two paralympic gold medals and a win in the new york marathon's handcycle division to his career highlights. reflecting on what lies next, he says: ""i have to tell you that the possibilities are not lacking in my life, and this is something for which i feel very lucky."" at school, zanardi didn't compete in sports much, ""because i was really fat as a kid."" after his sister was killed in a car crash his parents were eager to keep him off the road -- but they did allow zanardi to race go-karts. ""i clearly remember that first day on the go-kart being the best in my life,"" he says. zanardi first raced in formula one in 1992. after a contract with lotus ended, he switched to indycar racing, ultimately winning two championships. in america he became a popular driver, making a signature move out of performing post-race donuts on the track, and earning the nickname latka (a reference to a character in '80s sitcom ""taxi""). the crash in 2001, zanardi was leading in a champ car race at lausitzring in germany, with 13 laps to go. but as he emerged from a final pit-stop, something went wrong. ""i lost control of the car in the acceleration lane, spun around and basically ended up ... a sitting duck in the middle of the racing line."" zanardi awaited his fate as his fellow drivers sped by at more than 350mph. struck by the second car to pass, his car -- and his body -- were effectively sliced in two. the blood loss was massive. ""it was like having the sink opened,"" he says. ""both arteries were completely ripped apart; the amputation was immediate."" as a racecar driver, he'd had plenty of opportunity to ponder how he would react to such a fate. ""i said i would probably kill myself,"" zanardi says. ""then i found myself in this situation and that thought never went through my mind."" ""i had a clear perception that i had cheated death. i was very happy, and full of joy at being alive."" friends and family worried about how he would manage to get by without legs. but zanardi says the question he asked himself on emerging from a coma was ""not that much different in the wording, but technically very different."" it was: ""my question was, how the hell am i going to do all the things i have to do with no legs?"" his attitude was one of ""pure curiosity."" ""i knew i was going to find a way to overcome my problems,"" he adds. more from human to hero: from builder to pritzker-winning architect being a professional athlete served zanardi well during his rehabilitation -- he already knew that it simply takes persistence to achieve a good result. ""having been involved in sport a long time made me learn that you cannot magically make things happen overnight. you can only do what you can each day, and take the next day to add to what you have done the previous day."" ""the method which allowed me to get out of my troubles was setting a list of priorities, as i did previously in sport, preparing a race."" ""my first goal was to try to get out of that bed, and then to get rid of all those tubes and wires that were keeping me alive. then go on the toilet on my own and then, step-by-step -- very metaphorical in my case -- slowly, i got to the point of thinking about rehabilitation over a pair of prosthetic legs."" the comeback within a year, he had crossed all of those problems off his list. two years later, zanardi returned to lausitzring to complete his 13 laps, averaging nearly 200mph in a hand-operated car. three years later, he was contracted to race for bmw in the european touring car championships. four years later, he won a world touring car championship race, using his hip to work a modified brake pedal attached to a prosthetic leg, an accelerating device mounted under the steering wheel, and a clutch mechanism worked by hand. he celebrated by doing donuts on the track. five years later, he was back in a modified bmw formula one car, steering with one hand and accelerating with the other. he was again subject to the same dangers, but says ""life itself is that way."" ""the simple fact that we are alive and breathe means we have something to lose. in this philosophical way, i found it absolutely normal to jump back in the car and do things as i did before. ""i knew that if there was a way to connect my brain to the racing car, i would be the same driver as before."" if anything, he says, he is now less vulnerable than before: ""if i break one of my legs, it only takes a 4mm screw to fix it."" more from human to hero: opera singers are athletes handcycling it was an invitation to speak at the 2007 new york marathon that first inspired zanardi to try handcycling. ""i thought, since i'm there, i may as well do the marathon,"" he says. with only a month's preparation, he finished fourth in his division, discovering that, not only was handcycling a great way to keep fit, but it also allowed him to apply his knowledge of aerodynamics. by 2009, he had a new goal in his sights -- the london 2012 paralympic games. as well as physical training to prepare, zanardi spent hours working as his own race engineer, fine-tuning his cycle until it perfectly complemented his body. ""every athlete has different needs, because every athlete has different residual abilities ... you have to modify in order to find the perfect machine for you."" just as a racecar driver must interpret what the instruments on his dashboard reveal, zanardi says he also had to learn to interpret his own body's inputs and outputs. ""there's nothing you can do about power in a racing car, other than telling your engineers your engine doesn't sound or feel as good as it should ... here, i'm the engine. i need to be aware of what's going on ... "" a year after winning the handcycling division of the new york marathon -- completing the race in one hour, 13 minutes and 58 seconds -- zanardi won golds in both the h4 men's road and time trial races at the paralympics. victory was sweet, but being a paralympian was also fulfilling because, zanardi says, ""finally, i saw people realizing what kind of message can come out of sport in general."" ""you are surprised by the result they're achieving, but you can't help but think, the starting point for these guys was much further back than yours.""",italian racecar driver alex zanardi lost his legs in an indycar crash in 2001
"-- it could've paid for some wedding. with fiancée caroline wozniacki watching, golf star rory mcilroy thought they were in for an unexpected early gift in dubai on saturday. seeking the record $2.5 million on offer for a hole-in-one at the 325-yard par-four 17th hole, the former world no. 1 saw his drive roll agonizingly past the cup. ""i saw the pitch mark and it must have just run past the hole -- it could have paid for my wedding,"" joked the northern irishman, who proposed to his tennis star girlfriend in sydney on new year's eve. ""it's a great shot to get it on that green and try to get it in the hole. i'll go for it again tomorrow and see what happens,"" he told reporters. but perhaps foremost in the 25-year-old's mind on sunday will be winning his first european tour title in 14 months as he seeks to regain the lead from defending desert classic champion stephen gallacher. the scot carded a sizzling nine-under-par 63 in saturday's third round to claim a two-shot advantage over mcilroy, who shot 69. the 39-year-old was 10 under for the last 10 holes as he fired eight birdies and an eagle in his bid to become the first player to retain the title on the tournament's 25th anniversary. ""that's a great stretch of holes and hopefully he doesn't continue it tomorrow!"" said 2009 winner mcilroy, who played with gallacher in the opening two rounds -- also carding 63 on the opening day before a bout of food poisoning saw him struggle to 70 on friday. mcilroy was denied victory in abu dhabi last month after a two-shot penalty incurred in the third round following an incident flagged up by a playing partner's caddy. his last victory on the european tour came at the season-ending championship in dubai in november 2012, when he clinched a money-list double by adding to his pga tour title. ""i got off to another shaky start,"" he said of saturday's effort, in which he bogeyed the opening hole but rebounded with an eagle at the par-five third. ""the conditions were tricky out there, it was breezy. it was tough to get close to some of these pins."" veteran dane thomas bjorn, the 2001 champion, shot 65 to be tied for third with 23-year-old american brooks koepa, who signed for 70 -- both were four shots adrift of gallacher. world no. 1 tiger woods, the winner in 2006 and 2008, was 11 strokes off the pace in a tie for 37th after four-birdie 70 which left the american on five-under 211. ""i wasted a lot of opportunities out there,"" woods told reporters. ""i only hit a couple of bad shots, missed a ton of putts and just threw away a lot of shots."" meanwhile, former masters champion bubba watson shared the halfway lead at the pga tour's phoenix open. watson followed his opening 64 with a 66, but was caught at the top as matt jones carded a second successive 65. british open champion phil mickelson was eight shots off the pace after his 67 on friday.",rory mcilroy two shots off the lead at the dubai desert classic after a 69 on saturday
"-- a riot at a texas detention center was ended sunday. one prison building was heavily damaged, and about 700 inmates were going to spend the night in tents, authorities said. the disturbance began saturday at the reeves county detention center near pecos in west texas, and hundreds of inmates continued rioting overnight in the second such incident at the facility in less than two months. april orsoco with the reeves county sheriff's office said the office was notified by the prison about 4 p.m. sunday that ""they got it under control."" orsoco did not have details on how the situation ended, but she said no injuries were reported as the incident ended. the office reported it had no explanation for the rioting. three inmates were hospitalized saturday after fighting began, one with a severed finger, according to the sheriff's office. in addition to prison personnel, sheriff's deputies and officers from several other agencies remained at the facility sunday night. with one of three buildings at the detention center damaged extensively in the rioting, ""the warden is trying to figure out where [the prison] can house the inmates,"" orsoco said. she said the tents were set up on prison grounds, and inmates would be transferred to other prison facilities on monday so damage could be repaired. the prison is a 2,400-bed, low-security facility, operated by geo group inc. it houses federal prisoners as well as inmates from other states. as many as 2,000 inmates from two of the center's three buildings began fighting in the prison yard about 4:30 p.m. saturday, according to the sheriff's office. the center is about 430 miles from dallas, texas. on december 12, inmates took two workers hostage and set fire to the recreation area. those inmates surrendered later that night. cnn's janet digiacomo contributed to this report.",about 700 inmates are going to spend sunday night in tents
"-- this week, i had the chance to sit down and speak to joel osteen, pastor of lakewood church, the largest church in america. if you don't immediately recognize the name, you will certainly remember his perfectly coiffed thick head of hair, megawatt smile and most of all his optimism, which i would best describe as indefatigable. you feel good just being around a guy like him. i did. if you watch him closely during the interview, you will often see him look up to the sky when answering a question. while i know many people who have difficulty maintaining eye contact, that wasn't the case for osteen. instead, it almost appeared as if he was seeking out some divine inspiration for the answers to the questions i was about to ask him. we covered a lot of ground. despite what you see on television, osteen does have bad days. he has found that the start of any day will determine what kind of day you are going to have. so, he spends a few moments every morning thinking of all the things for which he is grateful. he also cleanses out the negative thoughts, from ""i am not talented, and nothing good is in my future,"" to ""i am a person of destiny, headed for greatness."" he also took time to remind me that ""sacrifice"" around the holidays will be rewarded. we were talking about the festive nature of the season, but also the particular challenges for people in the sandwich generation -- those taking care of their children and their parents. ""we're not always going to have our loved ones,"" said osteen, whose father passed away in 1999. it was powerful stuff, and it made us both just a little misty-eyed. it immediately conjures up images of your own parents and their mortality. dr. gupta: saving emma in the storm listening to all joel osteen has to say, of course you will agree with him, despite the fact he doesn't often take a stance on hot-button issues, instead deferring to god as the ultimate decision-maker. surely, these are not new messages, but they do need frequent reminding and refreshing, especially when times are tough. it was the next topic, however, that i really wanted to explore with joel: the intersection between faith, science and healing. he started by telling the story of his own mother, dodie osteen, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer back in 1981. she was told ""there was no treatment that could be given to her."" it was liver cancer, and she was just 48 years old. osteen told me, ""she prayed, she believed, and she quoted scripture. thirty-something years later, she's alive."" osteen is describing a sort of faith healing or at least the power of prayer, and it is an issue that deeply divides the medical community. according to gallup polls, 92% of americans believe in god. and 80% believe in the power of god or prayer to improve the course of their illness. we know that many people turn to god during times of illness, either in public or private. it is a profoundly human response, but also based on belief in some mechanism that we can't explain. critics worry that studying prayer relies on the assumption of supernatural intervention, which will always place it outside the realm of science. at its worst, they say, people may rely solely on prayer instead of proven, effective treatments. it is not that science hasn't tried to prove and even describe the impact of prayer on healing. a review of nearly 50 studies involving 125,000 people showed those with low levels of religious involvement had odds of early mortality that were 1.29 times higher than for those with high levels of religious involvement. religious groups such as mormons, seventh-day adventists and amish have lower rates of heart disease and cancer. dr. gupta: better health not about obamacare, it's about you there has also been a fair amount of research into the mechanism of psychoneuroendocrinology, the relationship between psychology, endocrinology and neuroscience -- in other words, the interactions between the mind, hormones and brain. that could account for the results herbert benson cites about the positive impact of prayer on heart disease. part of the conflict for the medical community is that many of the studies show variable results even within the same groups of people. critics worry aloud that you simply can't make prayer consistent -- or ever ""dose"" it like a medicine. when it comes to the power of prayer, though, proponents and critics do find some common ground. they both cite evidence that when it comes to our health, prayers and faith may have less to do about god than it does with optimism overall. it's the same optimism that osteen embodies. it may have more to do with the resulting social network, improved coping skills and health activities promoted by many churches. we are more comfortable explaining the impact on health by remembering that religious people are less likely to engage in smoking and alcohol abuse. they are more likely to inquire about each other's health and remind their loved ones to get checked out. while writing this, i realized it is quite possible we will never have the answers we want, because the intersection between religion and science can never be fully explored. that would require trying to ""reduce it to basic elements than can be quantified, and that makes for bad science and bad religion,"" according to dr. richard sloan, author of the book ""blind faith."" it doesn't mean, however, that we will stop trying. this intersection will capture our imagination as human beings as long as we are around. i did want to point out one of the more remarkable findings in a study from the american heart journal on this topic. it showed people were more likely to suffer complications if they knew someone was praying for them. go ahead, read that sentence again. no matter your point of view, how do you explain that? nobody knows for sure, but it could be that those people didn't typically have prayer or faith in their daily lives, and only relied on it when things had become particularly bleak or desperate. they may have thought, ""i must be close to death,"" if they were now resorting to prayer. when i asked osteen about that, he immediately nodded and agreed with that explanation. but he immediately reminded me, that is the nature of faith -- the belief that it will work -- and the benefits of that optimism flow from it. it turns out that truly understanding optimism and relying on it to help you during tough times requires practicing it on a daily basis, and that may be the most important message joel osteen gives us this holiday season.",many people turn to god during times of illness
"(cnn)hollywood's leading women want to be treated with a little more respect as they parade the red carpet on oscar night this sunday. and it's not hard to sympathize with them. female nominees, it seems, are tired of simply engaging in the same old small talk about the make of their gowns, the jewels they are wearing, or the footwear they're flaunting (not to mention the intimate secrets of their personal beautification process). so they have been pushing back in the form of #askhermore, a campaign launched last year that's being waged by women in hollywood wanting to broaden the scope of their pre-telecast conversations beyond fashion. whether it be cate blanchett's pointed question to a cameraman at last year's sag awards, or contenders refusing to raise their hands for e! entertainment's ""mani-cam,"" actresses are starting to speak out about some of the more sexist treatment they face. so, can we expect a red carpet rebellion at this year's academy awards? far from it. posing like a supermodel and discussing couture delivers a big payoff -- a lucrative contract representing a luxury brand of cosmetics, watches, automobiles or even bottled water and automobiles. such contracts give stars an extra income, allowing them to refrain, if they choose, from making b-list movies or popcorn blockbusters. plus, fronting a glossy campaign can also create a sophisticated aura around the star in question. and this award season has felt even longer than usual. instead of kicking off with january's golden globes, it started two months early, in november 2014, with the hollywood film awards. purists lampooned the telecast, which despite proclaiming itself the ""official launch of the awards season"" has seemed barely known to much of the public beyond hollywood. yet that didn't stop the talent considered a shoo-in for the big prizes from being out in force at the ceremony, gamely fielding pre-telecast questions from film and fashion reporters. and this week, the oscar front-runners are still talking fashion, despite the word on the ground here in los angeles being that some nominees are nursing colds, while others already have blisters from walking miles of red carpet in their borrowed designer stilettos. for some, it seems, the thinking is #askhermore be damned! it didn't used to be like this. serious actors -- especially those intent on winning an oscar -- once refrained from the ""grubby"" work of advertising. cher's decision to promote health clubs in a series of tv commercials, for example, was seen by many as scuttling her shot as best actress for the 1985 film ""mask."" if an actor did decide to promote a brand, he or she would generally do so on the sly, in japan, and pocket big money out of sight of western audiences (much easier in the pre-youtube era). today there is no such stigma. last year's red carpet star lupita nyong'o, who secured a statuette for ""12 years a slave,"" got an early jump on the oscar buzz-generating action at the telluride film festival in august before embarking on a six-month stretch of appearances in which she seemed to divide her time between film industry functions (which allow for networking opportunities with academy voters) and fashion goings-on. on the day her golden globe nomination was announced, for example, nyong'o was attending the paris couture shows. a month after nyong'o claimed the best supporting actress oscar, lancôme paris announced she would be one of its brand ambassadors. this is all a far cry from the days when the shoe was on the other foot, and it was old hollywood's leading women who felt honored to be associated with their stylists. golden age stars like marlene dietrich and audrey hepburn were proud of their associations with style gurus like christian dior and hubert de givenchy -- and they also paid for their clothes -- while grace kelly, sophia loren, janet leigh and elizabeth taylor relied on edith head, the head of the costume department at paramount pictures, to prep them for awards-season premieres and the oscars. similarly, on her way to winning the best actress prize for ""caberet"" in 1973, liza minnelli sought out the services of design legend halston, reportedly to ensure that she would have an image that would keep her out of the shadow of her legendary mother, judy garland. halston's reported advice? minnelli should purchase a set of louis vuitton luggage, which he then filled with clothes, footwear and jewels all made to measure for her. still, for a time, the demise of the studio system and feminist ideals started to put paid to women prettifying themselves (too much) for awards season. indeed, a slew of late 1970s and '80s winners sported pantsuits and cocktail attire at the golden globes and the oscars. but sharon stone's reasoning that ""if you are going to the oscars, you might as well go to the oscars"" may have marked a resurgence of glamor. onetime model stone liked fashion and understood how to wear fine jewelry. and today, her successors on the nominations list, actresses like cate blanchett, nicole kidman and julianne moore -- respected both for their style and talent -- carry her torch. and increasingly, male leads seem interested in getting in on the act. eddie redmayne, up for best actor for ""the theory of everything,"" has been a regular presence at events on tv. and although he hasn't been nominated for an academy award, ellar coltrane of ""boyhood"" has been working the style angle, becoming a red carpet star and the face of richard linklater's coming-of-age epic. and like nyong'o, whose claim to fame prior to ""12 years a slave"" was an mtv base show, coltrane has shot to overnight stardom . clad in sharp armani tuxedos and plush velvet isaia suits, he has gamely chatted his way through e! pre-telecasts. so if you tune in on sunday, don't expect the stars to be camera-shy, even if they are cringing inside at the questions they are being asked. after all, while some of them will be collecting awards for work already completed, the oscar pre-show is also a chance for many of them to be auditioning for some more work -- whether it's on the silver screen or a magazine cover. and for that reason alone, the red carpet circus isn't going anywhere.",academy awards ceremony takes place this sunday

""i'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,"" he told reporters during a news conference in senegal, his first stop on a tour of several african nations. obama hadn't talked to leaders of china and russia about snowden -- who actually turned 30 a few days ago -- in part because he didn't want to amp up the issue and have to start ""wheeling and dealing"" in order to get the fugitive in u.s. custody. in a speech thursday, national security agency director keith alexander ceded he's worried there may be more leaks from snowden. ""these leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security,"" alexander said. ""... what is going on, in these leaks, is unconscionable in my opinion, it hurts our nation and our allies. and it's flat wrong."" snowden has said he gave reporters information about secret surveillance out of concern these programs violate privacy rights and put too much power in the hands of government officials. as snowden seeks asylum, u.s. bides its time venezuelan president nicolas maduro said tuesday his country would consider a formal request for political asylum from snowden -- which it hadn't then received -- and foreign minister elias jaua reiterated that position thursday. another latin american country, ecuador, is probably snowden's most widely rumored destination -- and subject of a growing spat with the united states because of it. snowden has sought asylum there, the same country that has already agreed to shelter wikileaks founder julian assange, albeit at its embassy in london. on wednesday, u.s. sen. robert menendez, d-new jersey, said he would move to block ecuador from two u.s. free-trade programs should snowden go there. ""our government will not reward countries for bad behavior,"" he said. 4 options for the u.s. to get snowden back ecuadorian presidential spokesman fernando alvarado responded thursday by saying his the nation would spare menendez and his senate colleagues the trouble. ""we will not accept any threats or pressure from anyone,"" alvarado told reporters. ""we will not deal or trade in our principles. no matter how important the trade advantage may be."" the programs in question aren't free-trade agreements but u.s. laws that don't require ecuadorian consent, so alvarado's declaration may have little more than a symbolic effect. ""i'm not sure you can really withdraw from them one way or another,"" state department spokesman patrick ventrell said. while he didn't offer specifics, ventrell did say he'd expect ""grave difficulties"" in relations if ecuador granted snowden asylum. the two countries have been at odds publicly, but remain linked economically. ecuador, for instance, sent about $9.6 billion of goods to the united states in 2011, according to the office of the u.s. trade representative. the head of the ecuadorian business committee said he's worried that ""very important"" commerce between the two nations could be negatively impacted as a result of this tiff. ""it's a risk to give asylum to snowden because the united states, they could consider some economic sanction, including commercial sanctions,"" said roberto aspiazu. still in moscow snowden apparently remained in limbo at moscow's airport, a free man according to russian officials but with limited options. why would snowden head for ecuador? he didn't appear to board thursday's flight from moscow to havana, where he had been rumored to be heading on his way to ecuador or some other safe haven. while he has applied to ecuador for asylum, that request has not yet been ""dealt with"" because snowden is not in the country, ecuadorian political affairs secretary betty tola told reporters. she denied the country granted snowden refugee travel papers, as assange told reporters this week. opinion: why ecuador might shelter snowden assange said snowden traveled from hong kong to moscow on sunday using documents provided by ecuador. other governments have not specified what documents the former cia employee and national security agency contractor used to leave the semi-autonomous chinese territory, where he had gone to leak details of secret u.s. telephone and internet surveillance programs. u.s. officials have accused china of deliberately letting snowden leave. and they have expressed frustration with russia's refusal to detain a man they portray almost as a common criminal -- on par with seven russian fugitives u.s. officials have repeatedly said they handed over to russia in the past two years despite the lack of an extradition treaty. snowden and others have contended that he did america and the world a service by revealing information on secret programs, which they say wrongly impinge on people's right to privacy in furtively giving too much information to the u.s. government. but in his speech thursday in baltimore, the head of the national security agency argued -- as he's done repeatedly in recent weeks -- that the programs both protect civil liberties and help keep america and its allies safe. alexander pointed to 54 related cases that congress was informed about, of which 50 led to arrests or detentions. most of these were centered overseas, with 13 exceptions such as a foiled 2009 plot to bomb new york city's subway system. exposing the programs, he and others have said, makes it harder to spot terrorists and thus puts lives at risk. ""i believe the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks,"" alexander said. ""these leaks have inflamed and sensationalized, for ignoble purposes, the work that (the) intelligence community does lawfully, over strict oversight and compliance."" possible snowden posts on wednesday, the technology website ars technica published portions of chat logs it said show comments from 2009 by someone using a forum name snowden was known to have used. the comments criticized people who leak national security information. commenting on new york times reporting based on leaks related to confidential surveillance programs involving iran, the poster compared the newspaper to wikileaks -- which enraged u.s. officials by disclosing thousands of confidential diplomatic cables. ""are they trying to start a war?"" the poster wrote. ""you don't put that s*** in the newspaper."" ars techica said it could not be certain the poster was snowden, but information revealed in the posts matches biographical information he has since publicly revealed. cnn could not verify the posts' authenticity . if they were written by snowden, they offer insight into his thinking at a time when he apparently was more accepting of government surveillance programs. according to ars technica, the poster said of the new york times and its reporting on secret surveillance programs, ""these are the same people who blew the whole 'we could listen to osama's cell phone' thingthe same people who screwed us on wiretappingover and over and over againthank god they're going out of business."" four years later, snowden would provide news organizations in the united states and the united kingdom with classified information he acknowledged copying and taking from his job as a computer contractor for the nsa in hawaii. where could snowden go next? cnn's greg botelho, matthew chance, carol cratty, elise labott, vivian kam, adam levine, catherine e. shoichet and joseph netto contributed to this report.","new: leaks caused ""irreversible damage to our nation's security,"" nsa chief says"
"(mental floss) -- your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to seek out covert items at fast food chains around the country. not all food items are always listed on restaurant menus. be warned, this mission includes very real dangers such as hardening arteries and skyrocketing cholesterol. we've compiled a list to get you started. 1. if you're at starbucks and in need of just a little caffeine, don't worry -- there's a tiny option for you. it's the short size, and they don't advertise it. it's like a little baby cup of coffee. it also comes in handy when you're scrounging for change and don't have enough for a tall (not that that has ever happened to me). 2. it's a good thing we don't have jamba juice here in iowa, because i would be all over candy-based smoothies. because it's considered a health-food chain, jamba juice doesn't officially list these on their in-store menus, but the web site mighty foods assures us that the secret flavors exist. the ones they confirmed with the company's headquarters include strawberry shortcake, white gummy bear, pb&j, various flavors of starbursts, fruity pebbles, push-up pops, and skittles. other tantalizing flavors that are rumored to exist: chocolate gummi bear, apple pie, sourpatch kid, tootsie roll, and now and later. 3. this one might be my favorite. at fatburger, you can order a hypocrite -- a veggie burger topped with crispy strips of bacon. 4. chipotle has a whole secret menu that is limited only by your imagination -- they have a store policy that says that if they have the item available, they will make it for you. things that have been tested include nachos, quesadillas, taco salads and single tacos. some stores are testing out quesadillas as a regular menu item, however, so maybe someday soon you won't need a super-secret handshake to order one. mental floss: 7 food promotions gone horribly wrong 5. if you're at wendy's and you're really hungry -- like, three-patties-just-won't-cut-it hungry -- go ahead and order the grand slam, which is four patties stacked on a bun. this option is only available at select wendy's, and it's also known as the meat cube. 6. several places, including mcdonald's and in-n-out, will serve you the neapolitan milkshake. it's just what it sounds like -- chocolate, vanilla and strawberry shakes layered in a cup. 7. in-n-out burger's ""secret menu"" isn't so secret these days -- in fact, they've posted it on their web site. but in case you're not in the habit of surfing fast food web sites, here's the skinny on their rather un-skinny items: ordering something ""animal style"" at in-n-out means you're going to get it with lettuce, tomato, a mustard-cooked beef patty, pickles, extra spread (it's sort of thousand-islandy) and grilled onions. you can even get your fries animal style. mental floss: why is it called ""thousand island"" dressing? ""protein style"" is a burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun. a grilled cheese is two slices of american cheese, lettuce, tomato and spread on a bun (grilled onions if you so choose). and you can get just about any combo of meat and cheese that you want if you order it like you're ordering lumber: 3×3 gets you three beef patties and three slices of cheese, 4×4 gets you four of each, and so on. according to photos posted at supersizedmeals.com, one gluttonous patron requested and received a 100x100 at a las vegas store a few years ago. one item not listed on the web site secret menu: the flying dutchman, which is two slices of cheese sandwiched between two patties, hold the bun. 8. feeling a little health-conscious at popeye's? if you are, you really should have gone somewhere else. but there's a little hope for you -- ordering ""naked chicken"" will get you breading-free poultry. the word is that this is on the menu at some popeye's, but not all of them, although it is an option at all of them. 9. like chipotle, taco bell will make you just about anything within reason as long as they have the ingredients for it. since most of the food at taco bell is made out of the same basic items, that means you can probably ask for most discontinued items and get them. one ""secret,"" though, is that they have a not-advertised green chili sauce at most locations, and apparently it's excellent. 10. some subways will still make you the popular pizza sub from the 1990s. once the chain decided to make their focus healthy eating, the pizza sub disappeared from the menu in most places (the word is that canadian and mexican subways still offer them on a regular basis). but if you ask, lots of places will still make it for you. be warned, though -- jared would not approve of the nine slices of pepperoni and copious amounts of cheese slathered in marinara sauce. mental floss: brief history of dubious dieting for more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com entire contents of this article copyright, mental floss llc. all rights reserved.",some fast food outlets have not-on-menu items you can get if you ask for them
"(cnn)it seems almost silly to be writing about baseball in the context of recent events. except it isn't. last weekend, as baltimore reacted to the death of freddie gray, the young man who died last week from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody, major league baseball had a problem on its hands. saturday's game between the orioles and red sox had gone into extra innings in camden yards, with plenty of fans for both teams glued to their seats. boston fans feel at home in oriole park -- a so-called retro urban park built to embrace the luxuries of modern stadiums while maintaining that nostalgic feel -- because much of it was based on boston's fenway park. the boston faithful are used to being in the heart of a city to watch sports. but when the orioles finally pulled out a win in the 10th inning, 36,000 fans remained in their seats. they had been asked to do so by baltimore officials due to ""ongoing public safety issues."" the riots of baltimore, the peaceful marches of baltimore, the fury and unrest of baltimore did not seem to have had much to do with baseball. but as the always-wise atlantic magazine writer (and baltimore native) ta-nehisi coates' take on the situation quickly went viral, it became clear that the oriole's home stand presented a problem. monday's game against the chicago white sox: postponed less than an hour before the first pitch. tuesday's game against the white sox: also postponed. such action by mlb is not without precedent. in 1967 in detroit, the 12th street riots forced the tigers to postpone one game and relocate others (to baltimore, no less). after the assassination of martin luther king jr., mlb postponed opening day games out of fear of mob violence. in the wake of the 1992 verdict in the rodney king beating, the los angeles dodgers postponed several games. the entire league went on hiatus in the wake of the terrorism and violence of september 11, 2001. politics threaten sports all the time. from the demonstrations against the brazilian government before last summer's world cup to the massacre of protesting students days before the opening ceremony of the mexico city olympics in 1968, sports knows well that it sits within the larger context of the world. our deep investment in our teams -- beyond the tax dollars that construct the stadiums and the salaries players make (and the profits the owners and sponsors draw) -- is supposed to work to create community, to unify. cheering for the home team is supposed to create a sense of belonging. ""it's interesting that i have not yet heard anyone say that baseball or sport can heal this wound,"" daniel nathan, professor of american studies at skidmore college and editor of ""rooting for the home team: sport, community and identity"" told me. ""people did say that in the weeks after 9/11. this is not 9/11 -- not even close. but it is a serious social and cultural rupture. painful."" what happens next is striking. after two postponements, the orioles will play chicago on wednesday, but no one else will be invited. in an unprecedented move by major league baseball, the public is not invited to the final game of the series, moved to the afternoon in accordance with the curfew imposed by baltimore's mayor. while there are a few examples of fan-less games being played in the united states, none have been for such reasons, while in europe, there have been a handful of incidents in which soccer teams have been punished for fan behavior with fan-less games. without fans, does baseball mean anything? when the new camden yards made its debut in 1992, people heralded the return of the old-time stadium smack in the middle of the city. but are the residents of that city ready to reminisce about the so-called good old days? in a recent episode of ""real sports,"" chris rock delivered a brilliant seven-minute diatribe on the fact that less than 10% of baseball players or fans are black. ""last year, the san francisco giants won it all without any black guys on the team,"" he said. ""the team the giants had to beat to get there, the st. louis cardinals, had no black people. none. how could you ever be in st. louis and see no black people?"" rock's thesis? that baseball's sense of nostalgia encompassed by places like camden yards does not sit well with african americans, whose memories of the old days are anything but good. to his credit, orioles executive vice president john angelos, son of majority owner peter angelos, took to twitter to prioritize the issues at hand, focusing not on the lost games, but on the ""unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state."" yet as much of america continues to grapple with the idea that black lives matter, it is clear that the country believes sports do matter, whether or not anyone is there to watch. and with mlb's announcement that baltimore's weekend games will be moved to tampa, it becomes clear that the only thing that the united states has figured out about race relations, poverty, the achievement gap, police brutality, and so on is how to keep its baseball players safe and make sure that the games go on.",amy bass: baltimore rioting caused postponement of two orioles-white sox games. now third game of series will be played to empty stadium

""even if we get two inches of rain, the ground's going to eat it up,"" said david hennig, a weather service meteorologist in midland, texas. ""we need a pattern shift."" west texas averages nearly 15 inches of rain a year, according to hennig. in the past six months, only 13-hundredths of an inch of rain have been recorded in that part of the state. while october through march is typically the dry season, that amount of rainfall is far below what it should be, hennig said. he said weather models show the possibility of more storms this weekend and perhaps next week. while the rain is needed, storms accompanied by lightning pose a fire risk, he said. the guadalupe mountains face an extreme risk of fire through thursday, according to the national weather service. van horn, which is 165 miles west of odessa, is expected to face a critical fire threat on thursday, as well as the nearby state highway 54 corridor and the southeast new mexico plains. one of the largest fires plaguing texas rampaged between the towns of graham and graford. that fire, fewer than 70 miles west of dallas-fort worth, burned into residential areas surrounding possum kingdom lake monday night, destroying and damaging homes in four or five neighborhoods, according to marq webb, a spokesman with the texas forest service. possum kingdom resident jackie fewell set up a blog to provide updates on the crisis since fire warnings first were extended to the 3,000-home lake community. crews protect texas observatory with fire of their own ""i was frustrated by a lot of misinformation that was being passed around by a lot of well-intentioned people through facebook and text-messaging,"" she said. fewell set up the blog saturday as a part of the website for pondera properties, the lake's managing real-estate company, where she works. ""we have been able to generate this incredible response,"" fewell said, noting the site has served as a bridge between residents in need of help and those able to provide it. ""we get remarks from people all over needing help,"" she said. ""if we put out a query to get 200 leather gloves to the area, we'll have those gloves within a few days."" wildfire ravages home but spares family roosters fewell said the site has been responsible for aiding residents in a number of ways, from saving abandoned pets to providing real-time updates on properties threatened by the blaze. the palo pinto county sheriff's office said it evacuated 200 residents from the town of palo pinto and moved them to shelters. two buses were sent to evacuate jail inmates, said deputy randy hunter. that evacuation order was lifted wednesday afternoon. dianne simpson told cnn affiliate ksan that she and her husband watched nervously as a wildfire approached their house near the tom green county-coke county line, where residents had evacuated. texas forest service: fire dangers and advisories ""we just sat out here on the deck and watched it burn, and it was just pretty devastating,"" simpson said.

"(cnn) -- donald trump visited ""larry king live"" on wednesday night to tout his new book, ""think like a champion."" in a wide-ranging interview, trump shared his thoughts on how to prosper in this economy, bernie madoff, how president obama is doing, taxes and his daughter's love life. on cnn's ""larry king live"" wednesday night, donald trump said it's a great time for entrepreneurs. the following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: larry king: why this book? donald trump: a lot of people wanted me to do a book right now about these troubled times that we're all in. and it's been sort of interesting. they're great times, as an entrepreneur. i don't think i've ever seen better times as an entrepreneur. but the world is a mess, and the country is a mess. king: why [is it a] good time for an entrepreneur and not necessarily for others? trump: well, this is a time for smart people. this is a time for entrepreneurial people. this is a great time for people like me -- and maybe people like you, larry, because i know you're a great investor. ... weren't you involved with [bernie] madoff? king: a little bit, yes. you weren't, huh? how did you resist him? trump: honestly, i got lucky. he might have duped me like he did a lot of other people. he is a disaster. but now he's where he belongs. king: with troubled times like this for the average guy, is this the time to think like a champion? watch larry king's entire interview with donald trump » trump: this is the best time to think like a champion. as an example, the house is being foreclosed. you go see your bank -- maybe you can make a deal, maybe you can't. but you can make a deal with a bank on another house, and much better than the one you're living in. ... they'll do any deal to get rid of their product. they have houses by the thousands. and you go see that bank and you make a deal. king: how do you assess [barack obama]? trump: well, i really like him. i think that he's working very hard. he's trying to rebuild our reputation throughout the world. the previous administration was a total disaster, a total catastrophe. and, you know, the world looks at us differently than they used to. ... he was handed a pretty bad deck of cards. and i'm not saying i agree with everything he's doing. ... i do agree with what they're doing with the banks. whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn't matter, but you have to keep the banks going. king: do you assess him as a champion? trump: oh, yes, he's a champion. i mean, he won against all odds. when he first announced, people were giving him virtually no chance. and he's just done something that's amazing. king: is fear harmful in this [economic] situation, donald, or is it realistic? trump: well, i think it's realistic. people are afraid. they're scared. they're losing their jobs. they're losing their homes. and certainly there is a word known as fear, and there's nothing wrong with being fearful. but you have to do something about it. and that's what i write about in the book. you go out. you go to the right place, where there's better employment. you get a trade where they really need people. king: have you had to lay off people? because it seems everyone has had to do that. trump: it's a sad thing, but whether it's ""the apprentice"" or not, the fact is you have to say to some people: ""you're fired."" the world is different. king: you said that this is a good time to buy real estate. what about financing? what if you want to buy and you can't get the mortgage? trump: larry, this is a great time to buy real estate. and as far as financing is concerned, the only financing you should be thinking about is seller financing. if the seller won't give you financing, don't do it, because the banks are not doing their job. they're not providing financing for deals. king: new york state is planning a so-called millionaire's tax. it would affect those with incomes starting at $300,000. yea or nay? trump: well, it's a ridiculous thing. albany is going to destroy ... this state. and they are raising taxes on rich people. the rich people have lots of options, larry. one option is palm beach, florida. you move down to palm beach; it's not the worst thing in the world. i don't have to live on fifth avenue. i don't have to live on park avenue. it's hard, psychologically, for me to leave, but very easy physically. king: why don't patriots want to pay taxes? trump: well, i don't know that that's necessarily unpatriotic. i think they want to pay taxes. obviously, you have to pay taxes. but they want to pay a reasonable tax, and they don't want to see the money squandered. money in this country is being squandered. king: ok. but then we would debate reasonable. trump: well, you always debate reasonable. i think unreasonable is the war in iraq. i mean, there's $1 trillion right there. and, more importantly, thousands of people -- both on our side and the other side -- hundreds of thousands of people killed and maimed and so badly hurt, i think it's just a shame. now, to me, that's unreasonable. and, by the way, ... saddam hussein did not knock down the world trade center. king: has the economy at all cramped your lifestyle? anything you had to change? trump: no, because i think i understand life. i think i understand how to live. i'm enjoying my life. i don't really live in an as extravagant a way as people think. as an entrepreneur, this is the best time i think i've ever seen in business. king: there's buzz that your beautiful daughter ivanka is engaged or getting engaged. what's up? trump: she has a beautiful boyfriend. he's a great guy, but they are not engaged. king: would you like them to? is he the kind of guy you would except as a son-in-law? trump: he certainly is a wonderful guy. but it's all up to her. if she's happy, i'm happy.","trump advises to take advantage of low prices, get seller to do the financing"
"-- a 4.7-magnitude earthquake struck central arkansas just after 11 p.m. sunday, the united states geological survey said. the quake, the latest in a swarm of nearly 800 since september, is the strongest since a 5.0 event recorded in 1976, according to scott ausbrooks of the arkansas geological survey. almost all of arkansas could feel the quake, as could residents in parts of missouri, tennessee, kentucky, indiana and oklahoma, ausbrooks said. the quake caused minor damage across a wide area of arkansas. most of the damage was from broken dishes, cracked drywall and, in one case, a broken window. no injuries were reported. the quake's epicenter was 37 miles from little rock, the usgs said. the area lies atop several geologic faults, but none is associated with the new madrid fault, which shook the region in 1811 -- destroying its namesake town in missouri, bringing down buildings as far away as st. louis and shaking the ground even in new york. the area around guy was the site of another historic flurry of earthquakes in 1982. geologists know it as the enola swarm, responsible for 15,000 quakes within a year's time, followed by more shaking in 2001. ausbrooks has said the state geological survey was trying to determine whether the current swarm is natural or due to some man-made cause. cnn's jeremy ryan and rick martin contributed to this report.","new: sunday's quake is the strongest since 1976, the state geological society says"

"-- in a career already groaning under the weight of titles and accolades, roger federer joined another exclusive list of tennis luminaries when he beat andy murray in this year's wimbledon final. in notching up his seventh wimbledon win a month before his 31st birthday, federer became the oldest champion since arthur ashe in 1975, and only the 11th player in the open era to win a grand slam in his 30s. only andre agassi (at the australian open in 2001 and 2003) and pete sampras (u.s. open 2002) have achieved the feat this century suggesting that, more than ever, modern tennis is a game which favors the power, agility and the sheer exuberance of youth. despite the ambition of those young guns and not forgetting the distractions of a young family, federer's desire to remain competitive appears undimmed. after dispatching the then 23-year-old juan martin del potro in the final of the atp tour event in rotterdam last february, federer said he hoped to be around for another ""three, five, six years."" and following his silver medal at the olympic tennis tournament in august he reiterated that wish. ""i'll be 35 in rio. i think it's possible, but we'll see how it goes,"" federer told cnn. the swiss champion isn't the only one enjoying a resurgence in the autumn of his career. from his perch at the summit of the world rankings -- which he reclaimed after winning wimbledon -- federer surveys a top 100 in which almost a quarter (24) of players are over the age of 30. five places below the swiss is spain's david ferrer (who turned 30 in february) while lower down lie jarkko nieminen from finland and austria's jurgen melzer. the 31-year-olds, ranked 35 and 37 respectively, have both won tournaments this year -- the finn winning the apia international in sydney in january while melzer took the memphis title the following month. germany's tommy haas, who turned 34 in april, is currently the oldest player in the top 25. the former world no.2, whose career has been plagued by injuries, started this season outside the top 200, but has shot up the rankings this year to a current high of 21 in the rankings. the rise was helped, in part, by victory over federer in the final of the atp tournament on home soil in halle last june. ""maybe 30 is the new 20,"" the german told cnn's open court, not entirely in jest. ""you know, i think a lot of the guys are becoming so much more professional ... everybody is looking more at how physical the game has gotten and how important it is to stay healthy and fit,"" haas said. ""thirty, at the end of the day, is really just a number ... if you really love something and you want to do it the right way, why not do it until you really know you can't do it anymore."" it's a philosophy which federer shares, haas thinks. ""he's a world-class athlete. he knows exactly what he is doing. he prepares as well as anyone out there ... he doesn't second guess many things, so i'm not really surprised."" gil reyes, the feted long-time fitness coach (and friend) to andre agassi, says federer is just a class apart. ""roger is a perfect athlete -- his movement, his game, his mental, his physical. there's roger and then there's everyone else,"" reyes said. technological advances and the physically demanding nature of the modern game have caught up with players less gifted and younger than federer, says reyes, leading to lots of wear and tear. with players hitting that ball harder than ever, there is simply less time to play the next shot, he says. ""you're going to be out of position unless you redirect your body very forcefully and very violently, and that's just taking its toll on our knees and our hips. so you have to counter that and prepare your body for the game,"" reyes said. watch: boris becker tours his hometown preparing his body for the game enabled agassi to play with ""great relevance"" right up to age of 36, says reyes. the american's latter playing years were the most fruitful of his career with five of his eight grand slams won after his 29th birthday. he was also world no.1 at the age of 33. ""when you stop and think about it, that's amazing,"" reyes says. strength was the key to agassi's enduring success, reyes believes, who recalls ""a rather slender fellow"" when they first met in 1989. but together they devised a fitness program tailored to the stresses and movements agassi experienced on court. ""if we were doing certain running drills, he would say: 'i don't feel that on my legs the way i do on the tennis court.' that was beautiful because then he would leave it to me to come up with the training,"" reyes said. reyes would also tailor gym work depending on the playing surface -- the high bounce at roland garros requiring different strength training to the skiddy low bounce of the all england club's grass courts. ""i can say, honestly, that he was, if not the strongest player on the tour, one of the strongest. playing to 36 in this day's game it takes a lot."" reyes thinks the next generation of tennis stars will reap the benefits of improving sports science but does not envisage too many current players emulating agassi, with one notable exception, perhaps. at the start of the year, a back injury forced federer out of the qatar open in doha. it was only his second withdrawal during a tournament in his career and prompted speculation that 2012 might be a year of diminishing returns for the great champion. ten months on, federer has a further six titles under his belt, and heads towards november's season-ending atp world tour finals with just his own records as the oldest winner and six-time champion to beat.",roger federer continues to be a major force in the men's game despite his advancing years
"-- a disabled punk band has launched a campaign to fight for the rights of disabled people to be able to party late. heavy load are a uk-based punk band with three out of five members who are disabled. ""heavy load,"" describe themselves as an ""anarcho-garage-punk"" band and are made up of five musicians, one of whom has downs syndrome and two who have unspecified learning disabilities. their campaign, ""stay up late,"" encourages carers to support disabled people who want to stay out past 10pm. heavy load's manager and bass guitarist, paul richards, 39, told cnn: ""the stay up late"" campaign is to raise awareness, and tackle the issue where disabled gig-goers end up going home at 9pm, therefore missing most of the evening, because their support workers finish their shifts at 10pm. ""we started the campaign because we'd be playing a gig and something strange happens at 9pm when people would start to go home. we were also frustrated with asking to go on earlier in the evening so that our fans would still be there. it's not very punk to go on at 8.30pm,"" he added. ""stay up late"" has received widespread support from disabled people and the uk government, richards said. even carers who may be required to work later if the campaign is successful have offered their support. ""so far, we've only had one or two support workers say that they don't think they should be required to work unsociable hours,"" richards said. the group has also partnered with the uk's leading learning disabilities charity mencap, who they say have really helped to relay their message to a wider audience. mencap and heavy load teamed up last week where the band headlined a concert in london for people with learning disabilities, giving them an opportunity to be involved in running a club night. see images from the concert » they concert was held in conjunction with london venue proud camden, and around 400 people attended the event which finished at 1am. everyone at the event, from the door girl, to bar staff and cloakroom attendants, were people with learning disabilities, venue owner alex proud told cnn. ""it's the first event of its kind for people with a learning disability and there was a real buzz about how people with learning disability are an untapped source in the entertainment industry."" he said: ""at these nights there is a lack of inhibitions. they tend to let their hair down and really know how to party; it's a hell of a lot of fun for all involved. proud is eager to put on events that include people with a learning disability and to make the public more aware of this often overlooked group. ""young people with learning disabilities want to go out, but they are not catered for in the entertainment industry,"" he added. heavy load have been together for 13 years since meeting at the southdown housing in england, a non-profit assisted-living community for people with learning disabilities. vocalist jimmy nicholls, 62, posted an advert and a week later the band including michael white, 47 (drums) simon barker, 37 (lead vocals) and mick williams, 47 (guitar and vocals) was formed. since then the band has gained many disabled and non-disabled fans and a successful documentary, ""heavy load,"" has been made about their lives. now they are looking forward to setting up the ""stay up late"" campaign around the world. richards said: ""when we visited new york last year we were surprised to find that it's an issue for people with learning disabilities to get out much at all -- so there is definitely a need there. ""we've also been asked to go to russia, serbia, other parts of the u.s., scotland and czech republic to play and promote the campaign -- which we'd love to do, but money's tight, "" he added. however, richards insists the campaign is not about partying late every night.

"-- the united states and brazil jointly agreed on tuesday to postpone brazilian president dilma rousseff's state visit to washington next month due to controversy over reports the u.s. government was spying on her communications. brazil protested recent disclosures of national security agency surveillance, which were included in media reports citing information apparently leaked by edward snowden, a former agency contractor who previously admitted leaking u.s. surveillance information to journalists. a white house statement announcing the postponement said president barack obama had previously ordered a thorough review of american intelligence activities, but it acknowledged that process would take several months to complete. as brazil's uproar over nsa grows, u.s. vows to work through tensions rousseff spoke with obama on the phone monday in a last-minute attempt to patch things up, according to both governments. they decided for now to shelve the visit that had been scheduled for october 23. brazil still is not satisfied with the situation. ""the conditions for a state visit on the previously agreed date haven't been provided,"" rousseff's office said. but the white house said the two agreed to a postponement because they did not want the visit to be ""overshadowed by a single bilateral issue, no matter how important or challenging the issue may be"" and that the trip would be rescheduled.

""warming will bring melting. melting will bring water. water will bring floods,"" new york gov. andrew cuomo told reporters friday. ""(likely) more flooding than we have seen in a long, long time."" some roofs already have crumbled, but rain may collapse more, in part because the already heavy snow perched atop buildings will soak up this weekend's rain before it melts, erie county officials have said. about 30 roofs collapsed from thursday night into friday morning, erie county deputy executive richard tobe told reporters friday morning. with the rain and melting, some communities will be at risk of flooding through tuesday ""(we) expect 5 to 6 feet of water in some areas in a short period of time,"" erie county executive mark poloncarz said. some major roads, such as parts of the new york state thruway, will reopen friday afternoon, and some local driving bans are being lifted -- but largely so that trucks can deliver food to stores and crews can remove abandoned vehicles, cuomo said. he added that no one should drive unless necessary.

"-- it's hard to imagine the president of the international olympic committee on the ""naughty step,"" forced to stay there until he had repented for his behavior. but that's more or less what has happened. jacques rogge had to ""clarify"" (in other words, backtrack on) his newsworthy comment that there was a ""question mark"" over the suitability of mcdonald's and coca-cola as olympic sponsors. apparently he had actually first flagged his concerns four years ago, but the lure of sponsors' cash far outweighed any considerations about growing obesity levels ... and apparently still does. however, now rogge is far from alone in questioning high-calorie, high-sugar fast food brands sponsoring the olympic and paralympic games. the academy of royal medical colleges made a high-profile intervention in april, specifically singling out sponsorship of the games by junk food and fizzy drink firms as sending out the wrong health message. the london assembly has also recently passed a motion calling for a ban on the sponsorship of the games (and other sporting events) by such companies. even the financial times, though not sharing that policy prescription, agrees big macs are not necessarily compatible with olympic values and in an editorial backs changes to the way sponsors are selected and expected to behave. the media has, until now, been slow to pick up what health campaigners have understood for some time: there is public unease at some of the world's biggest junk food manufacturers using the olympics to heavily promote their unhealthy products at every opportunity, and especially to children. in fact, one might expect sentiment against the company to fall further, now the torch relay -- with its super-sized coca-cola trucks and brightly dressed assistants handing out free coke samples and merchandise to children and their parents -- has passed through britain's streets. parents' worries about advertising and sponsorship undermining their efforts to encourage their children to eat healthily are supported by academic research. a systematic review commissioned by the food standards agency and more recent studies have concluded that junk food promotions to children influences their food preferences, purchasing behavior and consumption, increasing their risk of serious illness in childhood and later life. the situation is made worse by the nature of the olympic sponsorship deals, which dictate the games' experience for children far beyond the olympic park. the exclusive rights that mcdonald's, coca-cola and cadbury's have for branded food and soft drink products at the games blocks brands and manufacturers which might offer healthier alternatives. meanwhile, licensing agreements restrict the promotional use of the olympic mascots wenlock and mandeville -- and thus access to their five-15-year-old target audience -- to these same official sponsors. hence all the food tie-ins with the olympic mascots are for chocolate and sweets. the sponsors try to sugar-coat their olympic involvement with ever-grander sports and exercise schemes that they claim will make children more active. however, there is little evidence that these short-term pushes will have a lasting effect in increasing children's physical activity levels. moreover, the companies cannot disguise one salient fact: no amount of free equipment and sporting initiatives will make unhealthy diets any less unhealthy. this is what makes mcdonald's, coca-cola and cadbury's such unsuitable olympic sponsors. the games are hugely valuable to the sponsors, which is why the merest sniff of unease from the ioc president is likely to provoke a fierce response, as they seek to protect their privileged position. the relationship should not be so imbalanced -- given that the ioc derives four times as much income from broadcasting rights as it does from sponsorship deals, it remains curiously reluctant to demand more from its global sponsors. now is the time for the ioc to re-evaluate its policies and its highly-prized sponsorship deals. we must ensure that continued pressure from civil society will be felt by jacques rogge and his colleagues and give them the courage to make it happen. four years' time may be too late -- not only for the waistlines and health of citizens in 2014 and 2016 olympic hosts russia and brazil, but also those in the emerging markets of africa and asia where coca-cola and mcdonald's are already ruthlessly exploiting opportunities to promote their products. cnn invited the sponsors named to respond to malcolm clark's argument: coca-cola: ""as one of the longest, continuous sponsors of the olympic movement, we are proud that we are able to use our sponsorship to enable millions of people to experience the games and believe we have a valid role to play. as well as sharing expertise, without the support of sponsors such as coca-cola, many national olympic committees would be unable to send athletes to compete. ""people consume many different foods and beverages, so no one single food or beverage alone is responsible for people being overweight or obese. we believe all of our drinks can be enjoyed as part of an active, healthy lifestyle that includes a sensible, balanced diet and regular physical activity. ""we are also helping people be physically active and our three-year partnership with streetgames will connect 110,000 young people with sport and create a new generation of coaches. coca-cola sponsors more than 250 physical activity and nutrition education programs in more than 100 countries and we are committed to sponsoring a program in every country that we operate by the end of 2015."" jill mcdonald, ceo, mcdonald's uk: ""as a popular restaurant with millions of families here in britain, i know that parents care most about the quality of the food that we serve. they also expect us to behave responsibly in all that we do. day in and day out we take those responsibilities seriously. ""here in the uk we offer broad choice on our menu and clear, easy to understand information to help parents make the choices that are right for them and their children. we also have a long-term commitment to reducing fat, salt and sugar across our menu that has seen us cut the salt content of an average happy meal by 46% over the last 10 years and the sugar content by 31%.

"-- like most people, i'd given some thought to what meat actually is, but until i became a father and faced the prospect of having to make food choices on someone else's behalf, there was no urgency to get to the bottom of things. i'm a novelist and never had it in mind to write nonfiction. frankly, i doubt i'll ever do it again. but the subject of animal agriculture, at this moment, is something no one should ignore. as a writer, putting words on the page is how i pay attention. if the way we raise animals for food isn't the most important problem in the world right now, it's arguably the no. 1 cause of global warming: the united nations reports the livestock business generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation combined. it's the no. 1 cause of animal suffering, a decisive factor in the creation of zoonotic diseases like bird and swine flu, and the list goes on. it is the problem with the most deafening silence surrounding it. even the most political people, the most thoughtful and engaged, tend not to ""go there."" and for good reason. going there can be extremely uncomfortable. food is not just what we put in our mouths to fill up; it is culture and identity. reason plays some role in our decisions about food, but it's rarely driving the car. we need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn't ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. the more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts. and although there are many respectable ways to think about meat, there is not a person on earth whose best instincts would lead him or her to factory farming. my book, ""eating animals,"" addresses factory farming from numerous perspectives: animal welfare, the environment, the price paid by rural communities, the economic costs. in two essays, i will share some of what i've learned about how the way we raise animals for food affects human health. what we eat and what we are why aren't more people aware of, and angry about, the rates of avoidable food-borne illness? perhaps it doesn't seem obvious that something is amiss simply because anything that happens all the time -- like meat, especially poultry, becoming infected by pathogens -- tends to fade into the background. whatever the case, if you know what to look for, the pathogen problem comes into terrifying focus. for example, the next time a friend has a sudden ""flu"" -- what folks sometimes misdescribe as ""the stomach flu"" -- ask a few questions. was your friend's illness one of those ""24-hour flus"" that come and go quickly: retch or crap, then relief? the diagnosis isn't quite so simple, but if the answer to this question is yes, your friend probably didn't have the flu at all. he or she was probably suffering from one of the 76 million cases of food-borne illness the centers for disease control and prevention has estimated happen in america each year. your friend didn't ""catch a bug"" so much as eat a bug. and in all likelihood, that bug was created by factory farming. beyond the sheer number of illnesses linked to factory farming, we know that factory farms are contributing to the growth of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens simply because these farms consume so many antimicrobials. we have to go to a doctor to obtain antibiotics and other antimicrobials as a public-health measure to limit the number of such drugs being taken by humans. we accept this inconvenience because of its medical importance. microbes eventually adapt to antimicrobials, and we want to make sure it is the truly sick who benefit from the finite number of uses any antimicrobial will have before the microbes learn how to survive it. on a typical factory farm, drugs are fed to animals with every meal. in poultry factory farms, they almost have to be. it's a perfect storm: the animals have been bred to such extremes that sickness is inevitable, and the living conditions promote illness. industry saw this problem from the beginning, but rather than accept less-productive animals, it compensated for the animals' compromised immunity with drugs. as a result, farmed animals are fed antibiotics nontherapeutically: that is, before they get sick. in the united states, about 3 million pounds of antibiotics are given to humans each year, but a whopping 17.8 million pounds are fed to livestock -- at least, that is what the industry claims. the union of concerned scientists estimated that the industry underreported its antibiotic use by at least 40 percent. the group calculated that 24.6 million pounds of antibiotics were fed to chickens, pigs and other farmed animals, counting only nontherapeutic uses. and that was in 2001. in other words, for every dose of antibiotics taken by a sick human, eight doses are given to a ""healthy"" animal. the implications for creating drug-resistant pathogens are quite straightforward. study after study has shown that antimicrobial resistance follows quickly on the heels of the introduction of new drugs on factory farms. for example, in 1995, when the food and drug administration approved fluoroquinolones -- such as cipro -- for use in chickens against the protest of the centers for disease control, the percentage of bacteria resistant to this powerful new class of antibiotics rose from almost zero to 18 percent by 2002. a broader study in the new england journal of medicine showed an eightfold increase in antimicrobial resistance from 1992 to 1997 and linked this increase to the use of antimicrobials in farmed chickens. as far back as the late 1960s, scientists have warned against the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in farmed-animal feed. today, institutions as diverse as the american medical association; the centers for disease control; the institute of medicine, a division of the national academy of sciences; and the world health organization have linked nontherapeutic antibiotic use on factory farms with increased antimicrobial resistance and called for a ban. still, the factory farm industry has effectively opposed such a ban in the united states. and, unsurprisingly, the limited bans in other countries are only a limited solution. there is a glaring reason that the necessary total ban on nontherapeutic use of antibiotics hasn't happened: the factory farm industry, allied with the pharmaceutical industry, has more power than public-health professionals. what is the source of the industry's immense power? we give it to them. we have chosen, unwittingly, to fund this industry on a massive scale by eating factory-farmed animal products. and we do so daily. the same conditions that lead at least 76 million americans to become ill from their food annually and that promote antimicrobial resistance also contribute to the risk of a pandemic. at a remarkable 2004 conference, the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, the world health organization and the world organization for animal health (oie) put their tremendous resources together to evaluate the available information on ""emerging zoonotic diseases"" or those spread by humans-to- animals and animals-to-humans. at the time of the conference, h5n1 and sars topped the list of feared emerging zoonotic diseases. today, the h1n1 swine flu would be the pathogen enemy no. 1. the scientists distinguished between ""primary risk factors"" for zoonotic diseases and mere ""amplification risk factors,"" which affect only the rate at which a disease spreads. their examples of primary risk factors were ""change to an agricultural production system or consumption patterns."" what particular agricultural and consumer changes did they have in mind? first in a list of four main risk factors was ""increasing demand for animal protein,"" which is a way of saying that demand for meat, eggs, and dairy is a ""primary factor"" influencing emerging zoonotic diseases. this demand for animal products, the report continues, leads to ""changes in farming practices."" lest we have any confusion about the ""changes"" that are relevant, poultry factory farms are singled out. similar conclusions were reached by the council for agricultural science and technology, which brought together industry experts and experts from the who, oie and usda. their 2005 report argued that a major impact of factory farming is ""the rapid selection and amplification of pathogens that arise from a virulent ancestor (frequently by subtle mutation), thus there is increasing risk for disease entrance and/or dissemination."" breeding genetically uniform and sickness-prone birds in the overcrowded, stressful, feces-infested and artificially lit conditions of factory farms promotes the growth and mutation of pathogens. the ""cost of increased efficiency,"" the report concludes, is increased global risk for diseases. our choice is simple: cheap chicken or our health. today, the factory farm-pandemic link couldn't be more lucid. the primary ancestor of the recent h1n1 swine flu outbreak originated at a hog factory farm in america's most hog-factory-rich state, north carolina, and then quickly spread throughout the americas. it was in these factory farms that scientists saw, for the first time, viruses that combined genetic material from bird, pig and human viruses. scientists at columbia and princeton universities have actually been able to trace six of the eight genetic segments of the most feared virus in the world directly to u.s. factory farms. perhaps in the back of our minds we already understand, without all the science, that something terribly wrong is happening. we know that it cannot possibly be healthy to raise such grotesque animals in such grossly unnatural conditions. we know that if someone offers to show us a film on how our meat is produced, it will be a horror film. we perhaps know more than we care to admit, keeping it down in the dark places of our memory -- disavowed. when we eat factory-farmed meat, we live on tortured flesh. increasingly, those sick animals are making us sick. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jonathan safran foer.",jonathan safran foer: inhumane way we raise animals for slaughter poisons us all
"(ew.com) -- when kevin smith announced last year that his upcoming hockey movie ""hit somebody"" would be his final film as a director, you could almost hear a collective sigh of disappointment from hard-core fans of dante and randal, jay and silent bob. smith's convenience-store drones and derelicts introduced smith's jersey brand of profane wit in 1994â€²s ""clerks,"" and a successful 2006 sequel proved that audiences hadn't had enough. smith's retirement threatened to kill any chances of completing the quik stop trilogy -- a challenge you'd think might tempt the ""star wars""-obsessed smith. well, there is a new hope. last week, during a book signing in new york, he revealed that his beloved characters might be heading to broadway. after seeing the hit play, ""seminar,"" which reminded smith of the fundamental stagecraft he used to film ""clerks,"" he suddenly envisioned breathing new life into the franchise with a stage production of ""clerks iii"" in 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original. it's still only in early talks, but smith tells ew that he's already broached the subject with several members of the cast, including the hard-to-wrangle jeff anderson, who played irreverent slacker, randal. the writer/director/silent bob shared his hopes in an exclusive conversation with ew. entertainment weekly: have you had any recent discussions -- formal or informal -- with the cast from the first two ""clerks"" about another potential edition, whether it be on the stage or on the screen? kevin smith: jeff was the first person i reached out to. i sent him an email after i'd seen alan rickman in ""seminar"" in february: ""you're the first person i'm gonna tell... ""clerks iii"" is gonna be a play on broadway. we'll do a six month run and sell out the entirety in advance. you up for six shows a week, sir? live?"" to which jeff responded, ""better lay off the weed, sir."" i told jason [mewes], just before we went onstage to do our ""jay & silent bob get old"" live podcast in london. he asked if he could be his own understudy. i haven't spoken to brian [o'halloran] yet, but he's the only one of us with actual theatrical training, so this will be right up his alley. i know i'll need trevor [fehrman] as well, because elias from ""clerks ii"" will feature prominently. rosario dawson's becky would feature in a pre-recorded bit. ew: anderson was initially cool to the idea of ""clerks ii."" is anderson just a stubborn negotiator, or does he truly lack an interest in doing this again? smith: it took a long time to convince jeff to do ""clerks ii,"" but we were both really happy with how the script turned out. ultimately, i think jeff would be into it if the script is good and so long as the the weinstein company is nowhere near it. but if we don't get jeff, it won't happen. he's the key to ""clerks iii"" for me. ew: how exactly would clerks on broadway work? smith: i'll make it as painless as i can: a six month run that culminates with a one-night performance we broadcast into movie theaters -- like we did with ""live from behind"" a few months back. so ultimately, anyone who can't make it to broadway to see the show can go to the movie theater the night we stream the production and see if for like 20 bucks. the hardest part for me won't be making it happen; the hardest part at this point, for me, will be standing on a stage for two hours and not talking. ew: last we saw, dante and randal had purchased the quick stop, and dante was going to be a father/husband. where might they be now? what's changed? smith: it's finally randal's turn to fall in love -- just as everything else falls apart. ew: lastly, and most importantly, would the donkey show in a ""clerks iii"" stage production be depicted by the same puppeteers who perform in ""war horse""? smith: if we can woo those f***ers over to our stables, maybe we can get spielberg to direct the movie version of ""clerks iii."" then i can direct a ""jaws"" sequel without feeling like a d***. see the full article at ew.com. click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. all rights reserved.","last week, kevin smith revealed that his ""clerks"" characters might be heading to broadway"
"-- an ambitious employee of ""the circle,"" an all-seeing, all-knowing tech company at the heart of the new novel by dave eggers, raises her hand to pitch an idea to her bosses: use the firm's social network to register virtually everyone in america to vote. then she takes it further. ""our interfaces are infinitely easier to use than, say the patchwork of dmv sites around the country,"" she says. ""what if you could renew your license through us? what if every government service could be facilitated through our network? people would leap at the chance. instead of visiting a hundred different sites for a hundred different government services, it could all be done through the circle."" the idea of substituting a frictionless private network for clunky government sites might seem an appealing one, given the much-publicized woes of obamacare's healthcare.gov. it's just one of the ways eggers is fortunate in the timing of his book, which seems ripped from recent headlines about privacy, technology and social media. ""the circle"" will send many readers hunting for the paperback copies of ""1984"" they haven't opened since high school. but does its portrait of a digital totalitarian future inspire the same kind of foreboding that george orwell's dystopian novel did at a time when many people believed dictatorships were destined to control the world? are google, facebook and twitter taking us to, as a joe nocera column in the new york times suggested, ""a world without privacy""? eggers builds his story around mae holland, a naive employee of her hometown's public utility, who escapes the boredom of her life in a cubicle by landing a job at the circle, the most desirable tech company around. through a friend, rising circle star annie, mae is installed in a ""customer experience"" post where she is dazzled by the company's feature-rich 400-acre campus, full of benefits for workers ranging from tennis courts to gyms to theaters to a cafeteria where famous singer-songwriters show up to entertain. powerful politicians are always visiting the campus. company parties offer primo food and drink. employees are encouraged to help themselves to the merchandise at a company store stocked with cutting-edge products that haven't yet been publicly released. mae's father, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, and who, with her mother, is locked in constant battle with his health insurer for the care he needs, is soon put on the circle's generous health plan, at annie's behest. yet mae's work, a grueling round of interaction with the circle's customers, is at odds with the paradise of benefits the company touts. everything she does is instantly measured and rated and she's encouraged to keep going back to the customers to persuade them to give her higher scores. she goes to absurd lengths to win favorable ratings. and those parties aren't only a reward for her hard work; attendance is mandatory for those who want to be seen as embracing the circle's values and suitable for promotion. officials blithely talk about the importance of ""work-life balance"" when what they really mean is that people should be using their ""off hours"" to be furthering the circle's agenda through social media. eventually, mae will graduate from ""customer experience"" and gain fame as she wears a camera that makes her life almost totally transparent. she only has to look at her wrist device to see the ""zings,"" twitter-like bursts of comments her millions of followers send as they react to every conversation she has and every letter she reads. mae's ties to annie, her parents and an old boyfriend and to her passion for kayaking are steadily weakened as she falls afoul of the circle's imperatives to share and to reveal all. rather than rebel and quit her job at the prestigious company, though, she becomes the fiercest adherent of its values. at the circle, employees are encouraged to think big, to hatch ideas for new services relying on the power of big data, measurement and intrusiveness. and those ideas are breathtaking in their ambition -- and scary in that they don't seem as far from realization as they should in eggers' fantasy world. a book that begins as a lighthearted cautionary tale grows into a claustrophobic portrait of relentless effort to achieve the culmination of ""closing the circle,"" erasing privacy and anonymity to the point where anyone anywhere can be located with precision within minutes and tracked by the circle's ""seechange"" cameras or by fleets of drones. how much of ""the circle"" is tongue-in-cheek? there are parts where eggers surely is having fun with mae's innocence and her bosses' laughable rhetoric and overweening ambition. none of the characters is fully formed enough to seem real. still, he seems to be searching also for a way to prod people to ask whether the cost of surrendering privacy is always an acceptable price to pay for the newest service or the coolest device. in a recent interview with the telegraph, eggers was asked: ""what is the greatest threat to our freedom today?"" his answer: ""our feeling that we're entitled to know anything we want about anyone we want."" in this respect, ""the circle"" isn't all that far away from ""1984"" in its ability to sound an alarm. yet orwell's vision, from the vantage point of the late 1940s, was guided by the actual horrors of the soviet union's totalitarian regime. eggers, as much as his narrative evokes the events of today from the nsa surveillance controversy to the obamacare website troubles, imagines a horrific future that hasn't arrived and likely will never come.","in a novel, a character proposes that a social network should take on government functions"
"-- gen. stanley mcchrystal lost his job when rolling stone magazine ran an article in which some of his aides made disparaging remarks about the vice president and others. but a newly released investigation by the department of defense inspector general finds neither mcchrystal nor any of his aides did anything wrong. in the article called ""the runaway general"" reporter michael hastings wrote that one of mcchrystal's aides referred to vice president joseph biden as ""bite me"" and another referred to then-national security adviser gen. james jones as a ""clown."" after interviewing 15 people, the inspector general's office completed its report on april 8. it was made public monday after a freedom of information act request by the new york times. neither mcchrystal, who cooperated with an earlier army investigation, nor hastings were interviewed for the inspector general's report. in the report, the inspector general writes, ""the evidence was insufficient to substantiate a violation of applicable dod standards."" the report goes on to say, ""not all of the events at issue occurred as reported in the article."" it concluded ""none of the matters we reviewed warrant further investigation."" mcchrystal, who had been in charge of all u.s. and international security assistance force units in afghanistan, was brought back to washington after the article was published. after meeting with president barack obama, he resigned his command and later retired from the military. but four days after the inspector general's report was completed, the white house announced mcchrystal would be part of the michelle obama's and jill biden's new joining forces initiative. the organization is set up to support and honor america's service members and their families. mcchrystal is now a senior fellow at yale university.",mcchrystal commanded u.s. and isaf forces in afghanistan
"a silent, nimble, two-wheeled killing machine. that's what pentagon researchers envision, now that they've greenlighted developing a hybrid motorcycle powered by two sources: an engine that burns several types of fuel and a stealthy, super-quiet electric motor. imagine an elite u.s. fighting force deployed in a mountainous region of afghanistan, riding motorbikes that are nearly silent. the loudest sound is tires on dirt as they twist and turn down dried river beds and up narrow goat trails. when they launch their assault on a taliban stronghold, the enemy is taken by surprise. the pentagon's defense advanced research projects agency has tapped defense contractor logos technologies and motorcycle maker brd to design the motorbike. as a platform for the project, logos is talking about brd's 250-pound redshift mx. although the redshift mx is totally electric, logos wants to combine that with an engine that burns regular gasoline, as well as jet fuel and diesel. it's expected to have a range of 100 miles and make very little noise, even when the conventional engine is running. ""it looks like a nice bike,"" said michael golembesky, a former marine corps special operations staff sergeant, after watching a cnn video of the redshift mx. ""i don't know about that wheelie action though,"" he laughed. ""i can't see any of our guys doin' that."" troops mounted on stealth bikes could deploy via helicopters or verticle-landing v-22 ospreys and later switch to silent mode for the final leg of their ground approach, logos said. controlling engine noise would be an important weapon for bike-mounted forces, golembesky said. but golembesky said pentagon motorcycle developers should keep this in mind: ""the guys on the ground love to keep it simple. it has to be simple because as soon as you start making things complex, things break, fall apart, it's less feasible."" golembesky -- now a 30-something colorado-based defense contractor and writer -- knows a thing or two about fighting taliban on wheels in the afghan mountains. he did it for about a year with the u.s. marine corps forces special operations command after two deployments in iraq. during his time in afghanistan with marsoc, golembesky and his teammates used small, four-wheeled, all-terrain vehicles to push quickly through rough topography during anti-taliban missions. soon after he left the unit in 2010, golembesky said marine special ops in afghanistan began improvising and bringing motorcycles into their weapons arsenal. they started acquiring cheap ""chinese knockoff"" motorbikes in afghan bazaars and customizing them. ""they'd weld racks on the back and repaint them, camouflage them down,"" he said. ""the bikes mainly became a way to overcome covering long distances over harsh terrain."" it was really a case of fighting fire with fire. taliban have been riding mopeds and motorcycles to attack u.s. forces since the beginning of the war in 2001, said golembesky. ""they know the most practical, low stress, low impact way to get around the battlefield and maneuver."" soon the marines developed tactics using the bikes. they announced a formal training program in 2012. troops rode the motorcycles regularly during marsoc combat reconnaissance patrols, golembesky said. ""the bikes allowed marines to patrol larger areas, to easily and quickly zip up hills. quick access to higher terrain allowed a tactical advantage which was often safer than, say, a low-lying village, where marines might risk getting caught in an ambush. another advantage: by constantly moving on motorbikes, special ops forces keep enemies guessing about their location. taliban ""don't know where you're going and they don't know what your intent is,"" golembesky said. ""the motorbike just amplifies that."" u.s. forces can use the bikes to sneak up behind enemies or block their escape. ""you can do a lot of damage, just having that mobility."" american special forces including navy seals and air force combat controllers have been using motorcycles for their operations for years. logos says the widely used current u.s. military motorcycle -- imaginatively dubbed the m1030m1 -- is based on a platform that's nearly 30 years old. golembesky's forthcoming book on marsoc operations in afghanistan, ""level zero heroes,"" is set to drop in september. the book follows a 2012 article that grabbed attention on military blogs. its title: ""marsoc motorcycle gangs in afghanistan."" ""whenever you get a bunch of guys together on motorcycles with firepower, it's basically a gang,"" golembesky said.

[they said,] ""when you do a new solo record, you should put it on there. it doesn't sound like a song we would do right now."" and they were right. when we put together the last matchbox record, it was much more of a rock record. cnn: what's the most surprising thing on your ipod? thomas: britney spears. come on!

"-- it's no secret among european football fans that for many years the u.s.'s attempts to embrace football -- or soccer as they like to call it -- were treated with derision. their players weren't as good, the sport didn't have any history, the terminology was all wrong and the commentators would get way too excited over average plays. the ill-fated north american soccer league, with its countdown clock and refusal to accept a draw as a genuine result, was proof to everyone else that they just didn't get it. but things have changed dramatically in recent years and overseas fans are now being forced to accept that the americans may actually get it all too well. major league soccer has doubled its size in less than a decade, now claiming to be the seventh most supported league in the world. and the appetite to consume the game in any way possible has boomed, with the value of premier league tv rights packages tripling. it won't have escaped the attention of many english football fans that their teams are now owned by american investors. this week's announcement that manchester city will become majority shareholders in the league's 20th franchise in new york city is proof that the strongest football markets are now taking the u.s. seriously. meanwhile, city and chelsea's post-season tour of america, coming at the end of a long and tiring year for both sides, demonstrates how important the u.s. market is becoming for premier league teams. it's good for business when nbc, fox and espn fight over the right to broadcast their games from england, but those teams have to fly over the atlantic in order to cultivate a fan base and stoke the interest. on thursday, city and chelsea wowed a crowd of almost 50,000 fans in st. louis with a seven goal thriller and on saturday, new york fans were lining up for more of the same at yankee stadium. but not everyone is a big fan of these post-season tours. the players are contractually obligated but surely many of them wouldn't be here by choice. and the england manager roy hodgson has expressed his concern with the ever increasing demands on club players, who are exhausted by the time they show up for international duty. but there may come a time when premier league sides aren't made to feel quite so welcome on this side of the pond. in fact, we might be there already. as major league soccer grows in strength and stature, franchise owners want to build and promote their own fan base. they're not going to want their own potential supporters investing financially and emotionally in clubs from thousands of miles away in london and manchester. at least not now, not while those teams are bigger and better, with players whose star appeal is significantly brighter. but man city might just have struck the perfect balance. by owning a team in each league, they'll have a foot in both camps. the american team will benefit from city's scouting network and player development, and club manchester will learn from the americans' marketing expertise and reap the financial rewards of mls success. and in manchester, at least, english fans will no longer be laughing at their american cousins.",the u.s. has turned into an important market in the world of soccer
"-- say hello to the new captain. in the first issue of marvel's ""all-new captain america,"" in stores today, onetime sidekick sam wilson sheds his falcon persona and picks up the captain's patriotic shield. sam replaces steve rogers, who begins to age rapidly after losing a battle (he came from the world war ii era, after all.) with a woman taking over the role of thor, an african-american captain america is yet another example of the diversity trend in comic books. cnn recently spoke to writer rick remender on what to expect with this big change. cnn: what led to this decision to hand over the role of captain america? rick remender: i had been writing steve rogers for a little bit; he's this kid raised in the great depression, and i wanted to explore that. that story has been the status quo of captain america since the 1960s. as i was developing the series, i fell more in love with sam wilson as a character and realized that in marvel continuity time, he would be a generation x-er, as am i. he'd have a more modern sensibility and be able to speak to an audience the way steve rogers wouldn't be able to, so we started building the story from there. cnn: how will sam handle things differently than steve? remender: the two characters both come from a tumultuous, difficult place. but sam is somebody who isn't reflecting on things as a soldier. he wants to stand up and put himself between the forces of evil and corruption and things that would harm the everyday citizen. sam will not be working as closely with s.h.i.e.l.d. as steve (spoiler alert!). ultimately, the way they approach problems will be quite different. cnn: what will steve's role be now? remender: steve rogers -- who has aged now; time has caught up to him -- will still be a tactician, providing his military experience. steve is almost an eye in the sky. since he is incapable of serving as captain america, he will be at the avengers mansion at the command station. beyond that, he'll be a military strategist, the one thing that sam really isn't. cnn: what have you heard from fans? remender: the feedback's been great! obviously, there's been a few ugly comments and people who have taken offense to the change for various reasons. but that's been the challenge of the modern era, to ignore the hate online and to focus on the positivity. one of the things we got were photos of kids holding the shield. we got a photo from a predominantly african-american classroom, where the kids were jumping up and down with joy with the image of sam behind them. culturally, that's something that is significant. if it helps one kid feel a part of something and makes them feel that they are reflected in their heroes ... that's a wonderful byproduct that will hopefully have more positive effects than just being an exciting superhero comic. cnn: will sam meet up with other characters, like the new thor? remender: jason aaron -- who is the writer of ""thor"" -- he and i have been cooking up some potential crossovers for the two books, along with appearing in ""avengers"" stories. cnn: how long will this last? remender: when i proposed it originally, it was seen as ""you can't do it unless it's going to be a long-term change."" depending on how well i do my job and people's reaction, this could be a permanent change or something that goes on for a good long while. cnn: what can fans expect in upcoming issues? remender: i wanted to put sam into something that felt like a traditional ""captain america"" comic book but wanted him to come up against an insurmountable wall unlike anything steve has even faced. this is basically the rise of hydra in the marvel universe, in a way we've never seen a terrorist organization rise before. under the watch of baron zemo and chancellor cassandra, they're moving forward with some big james bond-ian evil plans. hydra has already won before sam realizes that they're up to something. we put him up against a huge wall that's going to have giant ramifications for the entire marvel universe. that has implications we can appreciate in the world we're living in today.",captain america's onetime sidekick sam wilson debuts as the new captain

"utah officials have asked the u.s. supreme court to immediately block enforcement of a federal judge's ruling allowing same-sex couples to be legally married in the state. an emergency appeal was filed on tuesday with justice sonia sotomayor, who could rule herself or ask the rest of the court to weigh in. any action from the high court would be limited and temporary and would not be the final word on the constitutionality of the state's ban on same-sex marriage. a denver-based federal appeals court will take up the larger issues on an expedited basis in coming weeks, but in the meantime has allowed those marriages to take place. sotomayor told lawyers for a group of gay and lesbian couples who brought the initial legal challenge to respond to the state's latest appeal by noon friday. the supreme court could then issue an order on the enforcement question. u.s. district court judge robert shelby struck down utah's ban on same-sex marriage on december 20, saying the law conflicted with equal protection and due process guarantees under the u.s. constitution. utah voters approved a law banning same-sex marriage in 2004. shelby's ruling drew national attention partly because utah is viewed as being among the more conservative states and because the u.s. supreme court just ruled this past summer on separate issues involving same-sex marriage. in june, the nation's highest court cleared the way for same-sex marriages in california to resume after it ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend california's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. the justices also rejected parts of the federal defense of marriage act (doma) in a 5-4 decision, concluding same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits such as tax breaks. in the utah case, the state argued tuesday that numerous same-sex marriages ""are now occurring"" daily in utah as a result of the district court decision. ""and each one is an affront not only to the interests of the states and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels, but also to this (high) court's unique role as final arbiter of the profoundly important question it so carefully preserved"" in the doma case, the state said. the federal judge's ruling prompted a rush of same-sex couples to courthouses in utah where they obtained marriage licenses, despite the state's ongoing legal challenge. utah gov. gary herbert had criticized shelby's ruling, calling him ""an activist federal judge."" shelby, appointed to the bench last year by president barack obama, said the state's ""current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason. accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional."" same-sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in: alabama, alaska, arizona, arkansas, colorado, florida, georgia, idaho, indiana, kansas, kentucky, louisiana, michigan, mississippi, missouri, montana, nebraska, nevada, north carolina, north dakota, ohio, oklahoma, oregon, pennsylvania, south carolina, south dakota, tennessee, texas, virginia, west virginia, wisconsin and wyoming. it is legal in 17 other states and the district of columbia: california, connecticut, delaware, hawaii, illinois, iowa, maine, maryland, massachusetts, minnesota, new hampshire, new jersey, new mexico, new york, rhode island, vermont and washington. sotomayor handles emergency appeals from utah and other nearby states. the same-sex marriage case is herbert v. kitchen.",state seeks immediate ruling from high court
"-- sebastian vettel recovered from a nightmare start to become the youngest ever triple formula one champion as jenson button won the brazilian grand prix. the 25-year-old was hit on the fourth turn of the opening lap and suffered damage to the left side of his car which could not be fixed. but vettel roared back through the field to finish sixth and deny title rival fernando alonso by three points with the spaniard finishing the race in second place. 'brazil suits red bull' insists vettel ""i feel very proud of my team and of the season we have had,"" said alonso. ""we have lost the championship now, but not here in brazil, instead in some other races (belgium and japan when he was involved in first corner accidents). ""when you do something 100% you have to happy and proud for the team, and we will try again next year."" it means that vettel is only the third driver in the history of the sport to win three successive titles, equalling the achievements of argentine juan manuel fangio and michael schumacher. fangio vs. senna: who is the greatest? in a race which twisted and turned at every opportunity, it was no surprise that vettel was made to sweat for his moment of glory. a slow start saw him drop to ninth before a coming together with bruno senna left his car damaged. with red bull unable to fix the problem and his title hopes sliding away, vettel produced the drive of a champion, fighting his way from the back of the field to keep the pressure on alonso. all the pressure on vettel claims alonso while alonso sat further ahead with hopes of a third world title beginning to surface, the rain began to fall, leaving the drivers at the mercy of the elements. vettel was forced to pit no less than three times as the weather continued to change, while lewis hamilton's hopes of winning on his final race for mclaren were cruelly dashed. the 2008 world champion, who will race for mercedes next year, collided with nico hulkenberg and suffered a broken front-left suspension. while he was applauded all the way back to the paddock by his mclaren team, it was button who took full advantage. as the briton remained untroubled as leader of the race, vettel was still battling to get past schumacher and claim the sixth place finish he needed to claim the title. seven-time winner schumacher finished a creditable seventh on his final race before retirement, but it was the action further up the track which was catching the eye. alonso passed ferrari teammate felipe massa to move into second, but with a few laps remaining, vettel finally passed his fellow countryman to secure the title. final brazilian gp top 10 1. jenson button - mclaren 1:45:22.656 2. fernando alonso - ferrari +2.754 3. felipe massa - ferrari +3.615 4. mark webber - red bull +4.936 5. nico hulkenberg - force india +5.708 6. sebastian vettel - red bull +9.453 7. michael schumacher - mercedes +11.907 8. jean-eric vergne - toro rosso +28.653 9. kamui kobayashi - sauber +31.250 10. kimi raikkonen - lotus +1 lap",sebastian vettel makes history by becoming youngest ever triple f1 champion
"with domestic labor costs rising, many asian manufacturing producers are now looking to relocate their factories in other regions of the world. could africa replace asia and/or china as the world's next manufacturing hub? to be sure, africa has a number of manufacturing advantages that it has yet to realize. besides low labor costs and abundant resources, these include duty-free and quota-free access to u.s. and eu markets for light manufactures under the africa growth and opportunity act and the cotonou agreement. is this enough to offset sub-saharan africa's generally low labor productivity relative to that of its asian competitors? yes, if africa can implement appropriate supportive policies to leverage its opportunities soon. this is the finding from a recent book by a team of world bank economists. china dominates the global export market in light manufacturing, and its competitive edge far exceeds that of low income exporters that recently entered the global market. but steeply rising costs of land, regulatory compliance, and especially labor in china's coastal export manufacturing centers have begun to erode the latter's cost advantage, a trend likely to accelerate in the coming years. the ongoing redistribution of cost advantages in labor-intensive manufacturing presents an opportunity for sub-saharan africa to start producing many light manufactures, enhance private investment and create millions of jobs. read more: brazil competes with china, india to invest in africa according to new evidence, feasible, low-cost, sharply focused policy initiatives aimed at enhancing private investment could launch the region on a path to becoming competitive in light manufacturing. these initiatives would complement progress on broader investment reforms and could foster industrialization and raise the market share of domestically produced goods in rapidly growing local markets for light manufacturers. and as local producers scale up, product will improve, and experience with technology, management and marketing will accumulate, allowing them to seize emerging export opportunities. in sub-saharan africa, as in china and vietnam, policies that encourage foreign direct investment can speed up industrial development and export expansion. isolated successes can be multiplied, as with ethiopia's recent foray into selling cut flowers in eu markets: a single pioneering firm opened the door to an industry that now employs 50,000 workers. previous studies identified long lists of constraints, including corruption, red tape, inadequate utilities, poor transport and skills, inadequate access to finance, and so on. in contrast, the book proposes smaller, more specific, and sometimes newly identified constraints. narrowing the analysis can make the reform agenda more manageable within the financial and human resource constraints of most african countries. take the leather industry in ethiopia. this sector employs about 8,000 workers and exported about $8 million in 2010, a fraction of similar countries in asia such as vietnam. ethiopia's labor costs are lower than asia's and the country has africa's second largest cattle population, next to sudan. read more: why asian giants scent opportunity in africa furthermore, climatic conditions mean ethiopian animal skin is among the best in the world. yet the most binding constraint is the shortage of quality processed leather due to poor disease control, lack of quality processing of raw hides and restrictive trade policies on processed leather. once the problems are identified, the proposed solutions are straightforward. treat ectoparasites (the skin disease that causes blemishes) at modest cost; allow imports and exports of raw hides and processed leather to help alleviate this constraint; and provide technical assistance. some of these measures require changing existing policies. others require provision of public goods such as industrial parks that could be inexpensive. ethiopia's comparative advantage in wages, productivity, and natural resources has led the huajian group, a chinese shoe maker, to build a factory in ethiopia in three months, with two production lines starting in january 2012, exporting 20,000 pairs of shoes a month and creating some 550 jobs. so the opportunities and the preconditions are certainly there, provided african policy makers speedily seize them, as the book notes. but will africa be the world's next manufacturing hub? not likely. manufacturing can be an unprecedented opportunity for africa to industrialize and provide productive jobs to millions of africans, especially young people who make up as much as 36% of the total working-age population; three in five of africa's unemployed are under the age of 25. read more: is the west losing out to china in africa? but the emergence of china as a powerhouse producing a variety of manufacturing goods at very cheap prices thanks to the large scale and skilful exploitation of the supply chain means that not all manufacturing jobs will be transferred from china to africa. due to widely varying country conditions, some african economies can take advantage of favorable wages and natural resources and benefit from taking timely measures to develop and export manufacturing goods. but large-scale production requirements also mean that some jobs will be transferred to countries such as india, bangladesh, cambodia and vietnam while others will move to china's interior. in short, the invisible hand of globalization will work to ensure a redistribution of cost advantages to the benefit of the ultimate consumers around the world.",low labor costs and abundant resources are some of africa's manufacturing advantages

"-- every woman who's worked in an office has her story about discrimination or, as they say in the hr confabs, ""inappropriate behavior."" mine is the day i was chatting with colleagues in a newsroom some years back when i suddenly felt two meaty hands massaging my shoulders. ""i'm not sure who you are,"" i said before turning to face my uninvited masseur. ""but take your (expletive-deleted) hands off me."" the mystery hands belonged to my editor. i thought about that day while reading ""the good girls revolt,"" the just-published history of the first class-action discrimination lawsuit ever brought against a media organization in 1970. lynn povich, a 47-year journalism veteran who started as a secretary in the paris bureau of newsweek magazine in 1965, tells the story of 46 women with degrees from top schools who got tired of a system that relegated them to jobs checking facts and clipping newspaper stories, while men with similar credentials got the bylines and big salaries. povich and her female coworkers recruited fellow plaintiffs at secret meetings in the ladies' room. they hired eleanor holmes norton, the civil rights lawyer who today is a district of columbia congresswoman. and then they announced their lawsuit on march 16, 1970, inspiring the headline ""newshens sue newsweek for equal rights"" in the new york daily news, which went out of its way to note that most of the plaintiffs were young, ""and most of them pretty."" the magazine's official response: ""the fact that most researchers at newsweek are women and that virtually all writers are men stems from a newsmagazine tradition going back almost fifty years."" noted. a string of similar lawsuits against other news organizations ensued, and journalism's male guard was embarrassed into making some changes. today, a woman is editor of the new york times, and a woman has just been named that newspaper's public editor. you might think that gutsy efforts like those of the ""dollies,"" as the newsweek women were called by their male bosses, would have led to a media world that was all fixed on the gender front 42 years later. you'd be thinking wrong. it's a funny thing about journalism. the public has this idea that the media world is run by bleeding-heart liberals more focused on homeless shelters than tax shelters. you know, progressive thinkers looking to change the world. reality is it's a business like most others, run largely by men who push back at serious threats to their authority. in the old days, i had to stand up to cretins like massage man. betsy carter, a newsweek researcher who would go on to found new york woman magazine in 1987, had to put up with some guy she barely knew who walked by on deadline and ""planted a soft kiss on her neck,"" as povich describes it. today's woman journalists are less likely to get massaged and smooched on the job. but 42 years after that lawsuit, women are still shut out: men make up 60% of newspaper employees, write 80% of newspaper op-eds and author most articles in ""thought leader"" magazines such as the new yorker, which last year had 242 female bylines, 613 male. the record for ""new media"" is better than print, though men and women are still nowhere near parity. in a report earlier this year, the op-ed project said 33% of op-eds in the huffington post and on salon were written by women. at newsweek, where a woman, tina brown, has run the show since the merger of newsweek and the daily beast website in november of 2010, the imbalance has improved in the four decades since the women's lawsuit. in a march 18, 2010 cover story ""are we there yet"" written by three newsweek women, the authors said 39 percent of the people on the masthead were women, up from 25% in 1970. but men still had the star power, writing 43 of the 49 cover stories the previous year. now try to square those numbers with these: over the past 10 years, between 70 and 76% of all journalism and mass communications graduates have been women. at one of my journalism jobs, i blew a fuse one day over my male colleagues getting the high-profile web page spots where readers would find their stories while my work was out of sight. i complained, and my boss shot back an e-mail saying i'd cooked up a ""conspiracy theory."" lest i should get any future impulses to be uppity, he warned, ""i don't plan to address this issue again."" even a newshen with a byline is supposed to know her place. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of susan antilla.",susan antilla: women used to be routinely harassed and passed over in newsrooms

""hahahahaha,"" wrote erick erickson on the conservative ""redstate"" blog, ""i thought the world would love us more now that bush was gone."" what the critics don't see is that obama's loss on the olympics is america's loss. any red-blooded american who loves to see the american flag raised and the national anthem played when one of our own wins a gold medal should blast the republicans' giddiness over the loss. i can recall crying along with millions of americans when our hockey team beat the russians and won the hockey gold in 1980. where were those games? lake placid, new york. euphoria spread all across the nation, not only because we beat the mighty russians, but also because it took place on american soil. when carl lewis and mary lou retton dominated the 1984 olympic games, we all beamed with pride because they represented the united states on american soil in los angeles, california. and when michael johnson stormed around the track to obliterate the world record in the 200-meter dash (since broken by jamaica's usain bolt), we relished the win as he took a victory lap around the stadium in atlanta, georgia. americans love home field advantage, and we always desire to show the rest of the world what we are made of. i don't care if republicans want to rip president obama over going to copenhagen, denmark, to pitch for the games. this isn't about politics. it's not about ideology. this is about america. our pride. our chance to shine. our loss of the games. so, to all the critics happy about us losing the 2016 games, turn in your flag lapel pins and stop boasting of being so patriotic. when an american city loses, like new york did in the the last go-round, we all lose. and all you critics are on the same level as the america haters all across the world. you should be shouted down for not backing your own country. the next time any of you bang out a press release about ""buy american"" or ""support our troops,"" remember this moment when your cynical, callous and small-minded brains happily rejoiced when america lost the 2016 olympic games. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of roland martin.",roland martin: the chicago bid was made on behalf of the whole country
"-- prime minister yoshihiko noda of japan reorganized his cabinet ministers on monday, bringing in a woman with strong links to china amid a smoldering dispute between the two nations over a group of remote islands. noda named makiko tanaka, whose father oversaw the normalization of relations with china 40 years ago, as education minister -- one of string of new appointments. tanaka, who served as foreign minister more than 10 years ago under former prime minister junichiro koizumi, returns to the cabinet as noda tries to manage the fallout from the clash with beijing over the disputed islands in the east china sea. dangerous waters: behind the islands dispute japan controls and administers the islands, but china says they are an integral part of its territory that tokyo ""stole"" in the 19th century. the islands are known as senkaku in japanese and diaoyu in chinese. the japanese government's announcement last month of the acquisition of several of the disputed islands from a japanese family has heightened tensions between the two countries. violent anti-japanese protests have taken place in chinese cities, and economic ties between asia's two largest economies have started to sour. meanwhile, patrol vessels from the two countries have been frequently locked in tense games of cat and mouse in the waters around the islands after china sent a flotilla of ships to the area. chinese passion, fury fuels anti-japan attacks the appointment monday of tanaka to the cabinet may be interpreted as an effort to soothe those tensions by noda. her father, kakuei tanaka, was prime minister in 1972 when tokyo and beijing resumed diplomatic relations decades after japan's occupation of large swathes of eastern china in the 1930s and 40s. she was nonetheless a controversial figure during her time as foreign minister at the start of this century for the liberal democratic party (ldp), the political opponents of noda's democratic party of japan (dpj). koizumi sacked her in 2002, saying a public dispute between her and her top aides was effectively preventing critical budget bills from passing through parliament. she once reportedly called the foreign ministry a ""den of devils, an evil place where conspiracies are plotted."" her outspokenness earned her bureaucratic enemies but gained her popularity with the japanese public. how a remote rock split china and japan she also contradicted koizumi's government policy on relations between china and taiwan and on a controversial history textbook approved by tokyo that critics in asia said whitewashed japanese war crimes. it is unclear what influence she will have on diplomatic relations in her role as education minister. koichiro gemba will remain as foreign minister under the reshuffle. the others changes to noda's cabinet included the appointment of koriki jojima, a senior dpj lawmaker, as finance minister.",makiko tanaka is appointed to the post of education minister
"-- the blast was so catastrophic, it destroyed marty marak's home, killed his dog and leveled houses for blocks around. but he had no time for panic or grief. marak darted right toward the danger, even as the threat of a second explosion loomed. like the rest of the firefighters in the town of west, texas, population 2,800, marak is a volunteer firefighter. he doesn't get paid to battle flames or save lives; he actually runs a heating and air conditioning company. what we know about the explosion but he risks his life just to help his tight-knit central texas city. on wednesday night, the valor of the volunteers was put to the ultimate test. firefighters were already battling an enormous blaze at west fertilizer co. when an earth-shaking explosion blasted windows and walls off homes. rolling fireballs leaped into the sky, and residents 50 miles away felt the force of the blast. west mayor tommy muska, also a volunteer firefighter, said ""it was a like a nuclear bomb went off."" deadly fertilizer plant blast devastates texas town the explosion devastated marak's family. ""it demolished both the houses there, mine and my mom's, and it killed my dog,"" marak's wife, cheryl, told cnn's piers morgan. but marty marak took off, trying to extinguish the blaze before it could trigger a second explosion at a nearby fertilizer tank at any moment. a flood of other volunteers also scrambled to the scene, including firefighters and emergency medical personnel from hundreds of miles away, the texas department of public safety said. with her house annihilated, cheryl marak took cover in her brother's home, about two miles away from town. for hours, she wondered if her husband was still ok. ""for all those people who are still there ... responders that remain ... you just worry about everybody,"" she said, her voice cracking. what is anhydrous ammonia? the dread was amplified when the director of the city's emergency management system said two ems personnel and possibly three firefighters were killed. finally, shortly before midnight, cheryl marak was able to speak with her husband and hear he was ok. ""i'm begging him to come home, to let me come and get him ... but he said he can't. he's going to stay with his guys,"" cheryl said. so the excruciating wait continued. rep. bill flores, whose district represents the town of west, said the courage of marak in the face of loss isn't uncommon. ""that's just the way that we texans are wired,"" he said.

"-- president barack obama has invited congressional leaders from both parties to join him in a meeting to discuss what to do in the waning days of the current congress, vowing thursday that it will ""not be just a photo-op."" ""i want us to talk substantively about how to move the american people's agenda forward,"" obama said. the meeting is set for november 18, obama said, following elections tuesday in which his democratic party lost control of the house of representatives and saw its senate majority reduced. current members of congress keep their jobs until the end of the year in what's known as the ""lame-duck"" session. obama said he wants the meeting to discuss the future of the bush-era tax cuts that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. republicans and democrats disagree about how to extend them. the president calls for extending the lower tax rates for income up to $200,000 a year for individuals or $250,000 a year for families. income above those levels would be taxed at rates from the 1990s, before the tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003. most republicans oppose letting anyone's tax rates go up, including the 2 percent of the population that earns income greater than the thresholds proposed by obama. ""we have to act in order to assure that middle-class families don't see a big tax spike because of how the bush tax cuts have been structured,"" obama said. ""it is very important that we extend those middle-class tax cuts."" the president said businesses also needed ""certainty"" about the future concerning tax rates. republicans argue that the income levels in obama's proposal would hit too many small business owners and harm job creation. potential compromises under discussion would raise the income level for the tax cut extensions to $1 million, or temporarily extend all the tax cuts with time limits for higher income levels. obama conceded wednesday that his party had taken a ""shellacking"" from the voters the day before, and the republican leader in the senate has signaled that he wants to roll back what obama's administration and the democratic-controlled congress have done instead of working with them to seek compromises on major issues. ""for the past two years, democrat lawmakers chose to ignore the american people, so on tuesday the american people chose new lawmakers,"" sen. mitch mcconnell, r-kentucky, said in a speech thursday to the heritage foundation. ""the white house has a choice: they can change course, or they can double down on a vision of government that the american people have roundly rejected,"" mcconnell said. in response, white house press secretary robert gibbs said thursday that any consensus reached in talks between obama the congressional republicans would not give everyone what they wanted. gibbs also said he expected the november 18 meeting to be just the start of discussions, saying: ""i anticipate that this is the first of many."" obama used his brief statement after a cabinet meeting to highlight his legislative priorities. he urged the upcoming lame-duck congress to approve an arms control agreement with russia, saying it is neither a republican nor a democratic issue. the senate must approve international treaties for them to take effect. ""we have negotiated with the russians significant reductions in our nuclear arms"" in the new start treaty, obama said. that has given the united states leverage in seeking increased pressure against iran's controversial nuclear program, obama argued, because ""people have seen that we are serious about taking our responsibilities when it comes to non-proliferation."" obama is also planning to meet newly elected governors from both parties, he said. he's invited them to the white house on december 2. the meeting will be a ""terrific opportunity to hear from them ... about what they're seeing, what ideas they think washington needs to be paying attention to,"" obama said. ""they've got very practical problems that they've got to solve,"" he said, praising their ""common-sense approach that the american people are looking for right now."" cnn's richard allen greene and tom cohen contributed to this story.",new: white house spokesman says he expects multiple meetings to occur

"(cnn)let's call this nfl game balls for dummies. oh, don't take offense. up until a few days ago, when the deflategate ""scandal"" broke, we were all dummies when it came to the esoterica of nfl ball rules. hell, let's be honest; we were imbeciles. now, we're learning all sorts of fancy things about the league's regulations and how teams and referees handle footballs before and during a game. for instance, did you know the ball must be a ""prolate spheroid""? and did you know that before today, the term ""prolate spheroid"" had appeared on cnn.com only four times in its history? perhaps that's for the better. anyway, you've got questions, and as so often is the case, we have answers. let's get pumped up! (sorry, it's tough for writers to resist a play on words, no matter how terrible.) what on earth is going on? the nfl is investigating the new england patriots to determine why 11 of the 12 game balls they provided for sunday's afc championship game were under-inflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each. the pats supplied their own balls? isn't that letting the fox watch the hen house? wellllllll, for lack of a more elaborate answer ... yes? according to nfl regulations, each team provides a dozen balls to the referee for testing two hours and 15 minutes before kickoff. the home team also supplies 12 backup balls, and for outdoor games, the visiting team has the option of bringing another 12 balls. in addition, the ball manufacturer -- in this case, wilson (cue ""cast away"" jokes) -- ships eight more balls, in what the nfl scientifically terms ""a special box,"" directly to the referee. the box is opened two hours and 15 minutes before the game, and the referee marks each ball with a ""k,"" to designate it for kicking. espn writer kate fagan pointed out the curiosity of the regulation in an appearance on ""around the horn"" on wednesday. when fagan played college basketball, she said, the referees brought out ncaa-supplied balls an hour before the game. those balls were used for warmups and the game, and they were not to leave the court, she said. if the ncaa has such a rule for women's basketball games, she posited, how can the ludicrously profitable nfl not provide its own game balls? a fine question. who's in charge of making sure balls are up to snuff? ""the referee shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications. a pump is to be furnished by the home club, and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game,"" nfl rules state. the ball attendant transports the footballs to the field, and ball boys keep them on the sideline, espn reports. ball boys are usually vetted by teams and paid by the nfl and can be sons or daughters of team employees, the network reports. so it was the ball boy! yes, with a candlestick in the conservatory. that's a joke. if the nfl had pinpointed a culprit, cnn wouldn't need to devote writers to deciphering the league's game-ball rules. what other rules pertain to a game ball? as mentioned, it has to be a prolate spheroid, which in layman's terms means ""shaped like a football,"" and it has to be signed by commissioner roger goodell -- as opposed to, say, kate upton or ""weird"" al yankovic. it should have between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds of air per square inch and weigh 14 to 15 ounces. it should have a long axis of 11 to 11.25 inches, a long circumference of 28 to 28.5 inches and a short circumference of 21 to 21.25 inches. and, perhaps most importantly, it needs to be constructed of a urethane bladder encased in pebble-grained leather of ""natural tan color."" so, no purple footballs. why would someone deflate the balls? it supposedly makes them easier to grip for the quarterback and receivers. that would've been especially important in the wet conditions in which the afc championship was played. is it always an advantage? eh, unclear. green bay packers quarterback aaron rodgers allegedly once told commentator and former quarterback phil simms that he could get a better grip on an over-inflated ball. how was the issue even raised? in the second half of sunday's game, indianapolis colts linebacker d'qwell jackson intercepted patriots quarterback tom brady. according to newsday, he took the ball to his team's equipment staff, which then informed head coach chuck pagano, who told general manager ryan grigson, who told nfl director of football operations mike kensil, who told the officials on the field. this should remind you of that kindergarten game where you sat in a circle whispering things in your classmates' ears to demonstrate how messages are lost as they're conveyed from one person to the next. thus, it's entirely possible jackson told the equipment staff he wanted to go for pizza after the game, and by the time it got to the officials we had deflategate. what about the wing official and umpire who spot the ball before each play? wouldn't they have noticed? hmm, you would think so. has this ever happened before? there are lots of tales of ball manipulation surfacing in the wake of deflategate, but one particular story stands out. in 2012, the university of southern california, which kind of has this thing for cheating, was accused of under-inflating balls used in a game against the oregon ducks. the school was reprimanded and fined, and a student-manager was axed when he conceded that he had under-inflated the balls after the officials had approved them. the unnamed student said he did it all by his lonesome, and no other usc coach, staff member or administrator had any knowledge of his shenanigans. could weather have played a role? there have been numerous reports that cold weather can diminish ball pressure, which would normally be pertinent for the boston area ... except that it was 51 degrees in foxborough, massachusetts, at kickoff. is it possible patriots coach bill belichick knew? outside of massachusetts, the general public puts belichick somewhere on par with whitey bulger, so you'll find no shortage of people who say, ""oh, most definitely,"" especially after spygate. the coach says, however, ""in my entire coaching career, i have never talked to any player (or) staff member about football air pressure."" what about brady? asked about it monday on a boston radio show, the three-time super bowl winner responded, ""i don't even respond to stuff like this."" he also responded by calling the accusation ""ridiculous."" on thursday, he told reporters he didn't alter the balls and assured them, ""i've always played by the rules."" at least one football icon has his doubts that gisele bundchen's lesser half was not complicit. in one of the most damning non-accusations in history, hall of fame coach john madden told the sports xchange he believed belichick was clueless about the ball pressure, but ""i can see -- and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone -- but i can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy."" he also said, ""that's something that wouldn't be driven by a coach or just the equipment guy. nobody, not even the head coach, would do anything to the football unilaterally, such as adjust the amount of pressure in a ball, without the quarterback not knowing. it would have to be the quarterback's idea."" what to make of that? no idea, but they did name the greatest video game the world has ever known after the dude. has the rest of the team spoken up? several patriots have called the controversy ""stupid"" and accused the media of fueling the controversy.

"-- agents arrested 20 out of 42 people accused in a california medicaid fraud ring that allegedly bilked the state out of nearly $4.6 million and put the lives of disabled children at risk, a prosecutor said. the defendants are accused of either posing as licensed nurses or organizing a scheme to send unlicensed nurses to provide home- or school-based care to disabled patients, many of them children with cerebral palsy or other developmental disabilities, the office of the u.s. attorney for central california said in a written statement. the long defendant's list makes the case the largest of medicaid fraud in california, u.s. attorney thomas o'brien said in the statement. each defendant has been charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and at least one count of health care fraud, according to the statement. some parents and patients became suspicious of the nurses when they noticed their lack of skills. ""in one case, a 'nurse' was unable to replace a tracheotomy tube that had fallen out of a young patient's neck. in another case, an impostor nurse simply fled a medical situation when she apparently was unable to provide assistance,"" according to the statement. some of the unlicensed nurses had foreign training, but never passed a u.s. qualifying nursing exam, the attorney's office said, while others had no medical training at all. two defendants -- susan bendigo and priscilla villabroza, the accused ringleaders -- were charged separately. bendigo and villabroza instructed the workers to lie about their status and used the names of licensed nurses on documents, the indictment says. villabroza operated a home health agency -- the santa fe springs company medicare plus home health providers -- the indictment said. villabroza, a registered nurse, knowingly hired unlicensed nurses and billed medi-cal, california's medicaid program, for the work of licensed vocational nurses from august 2004 through 2007, the indictment alleges. villabroza pleaded guilty last year to five federal counts of health care fraud, the attorney's office said. bendigo, a registered nurse, was also director of santa fe springs' excel plus home health services, which provided nurses to home health agencies, according to the indictment. bendigo also was charged last year but fled the country, the statement said. officials think she is hiding in the philippines, said u.s. attorney's spokesman thom mrozek. villabroza is awaiting sentencing, and could be sent to prison for up to 50 years, mrozek said. each of the 42 new defendants faces a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison for each charge if convicted, according to the statement.",prosecutor: long defendants list makes case the largest medicaid fraud in california
"-- meet bailey. she's a registered therapy dog, but you won't find her in hospitals or nursing homes. instead, bailey makes weekly visits to libraries and schools. she sits quietly or snuggles up to kids as they read her a book. and no, she's not napping, and the kids don't have treats in their pockets. she's actually helping these children learn to read. it sounds implausible. after all, dogs can't read. how could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? but it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working. the philosophy is simple. children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. but reading to a dog isn't so scary. it won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. in a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. and for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference. kathy klotz is executive director of intermountain therapy animals, which runs a nationwide program called r.e.a.d. -- reading education assistance dogs. she says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence. ""a factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,"" she says. ""they get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...they just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog."" video: meet bailey and wilmoth the children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. and now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher. ""one of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,"" says klotz. ""like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. and then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together."" bailey and her owner, jim wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in west virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. they're part of the ""sit. stay. read."" program, which is similar to r.e.a.d. programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the united states. ""the kids come in and read stories to bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,"" says wilmoth, who was interviewed by ireporter jennifer sias at the west virginia book festival. ""it encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system."" ireport.com: wilmoth explains how he and bailey got started and then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. according to the researchers at the center for the human-animal bond at purdue university, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. the national institutes of health confirms what any dog owner knows: dogs have been found to reduce stress. each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading. for older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs. ""a comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,"" she explains. ""they get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... they love it."" it's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. however, klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. she says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. she's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. and klotz thinks that reading comprehension is just the beginning of how these dogs help kids. ""it's not just reading scores,"" she says. ""they start to speak up in class, and volunteer, and finish homework. they don't want to miss school when they're going to read to the dog, so it improves attendance. it kind of just flows over onto everything."" r.e.a.d. staff and volunteers know people are skeptical about the program's results at first, but klotz says anyone who's spent time with a dog will understand. ""it sounds a little kooky when people first hear the idea,"" she admits. ""but if they know dogs at all, and the way people relate to dogs, it quickly starts to make sense. but you don't quite ever grasp how really lovely it is until you see it happen and you see the kids light up and you see how excited they are. you see all these changes in them that they just weren't able to make.""",therapy dogs in libraries can help kids become more comfortable with reading
"karen garner sometimes catches her husband, jim, crying in the kitchen of their virginia home. ""all i'm good for now is doing the dishes and the laundry,"" the former air force senior master sergeant complains through his tears. ""i want to come back to him and say, 'no, that's not true' and rattle off some examples ... but i stop myself,"" garner said. ""because he's right."" jim was diagnosed with early-onset alzheimer's disease three years ago. he was 48. he lost his job as his cognitive ability declined and now spends his days trying to complete the list of few simple tasks his wife leaves him. he often calls garner at her job with questions. she worries constantly that this will be the day that he'll get lost or hurt himself or set the house on fire. ""he hasn't done anything yet to cause me concern, but i know it's coming. i know that one day, something will happen,"" garner said. more than 35 million people worldwide live with dementia today, according to a new report. by 2050, that number is expected to more than triple to 115 million. the majority require constant care; they're dependent -- and that dependence can impact their loved ones in unmeasurable ways. ""people with dementia have special needs for care,"" the report from alzheimer's disease international says. ""they need more personal care, more hours of care, and more supervision, all of which is associated with greater caregiver strain, and higher costs."" the 2013 world alzheimer's report, titled ""journey of care,"" examines global trends related to older people who need dementia care, including those with alzheimer's disease. 5 things i learned at 'dementia village' in the early stages of dementia, patients become forgetful. they get confused about the time or their location. decisions are difficult. as the disease progresses, patients have a harder time communicating and caring for themselves. by the final stage, patients can no longer recognize their loved ones, eat without assistance or even move. it's a slow, torturous decline, garner says. jim breaks some things and loses others. he provides off-the-wall answers to people's questions. he's emotionally detached from their two kids, aged 9 and 12. she worries that her kids won't remember what an ""awesome"" father jim was. he was the dad who got up in the middle of the night to help with feedings and change diapers. he read to the kids, played with them, took care of them when they were sick. garner is brutally honest about the impact the disease is having on the family. ""it would be a little bit easier if he would just decline quickly and get it over with,"" garner said. ""but unfortunately, alzheimer's doesn't work that way."" people with alzheimer's live on average four to eight years after they're diagnosed, but some may live 20 years beyond their initial diagnosis. caregivers, whether they're family or professionals, share many traits, the world alzheimer report notes; they often do demanding work with minimal training or preparation. they're also underpaid and undervalued. professional caregivers usually earn minimum wage and often report poor job satisfaction. family members, of course, earn nothing and make many personal sacrifices to care for a loved one. ""because of the progressive nature of the disease and the length of its duration, alzheimer's care needs only escalate, often to the point of impacting the caregiver's own health,"" angela geiger, chief strategy officer of the alzheimer's association, said in a statement. and the problem is getting worse. increasing life expectancies and an aging population are creating a group of seniors that's bigger than the working-age population that supports them, the report says. approximately 4% of the population in developed countries now is currently over the age of 80; in 2050, experts predict, that number will rise to 10%. the world alzheimer's report identifies four areas in which ""specific actions could lead to improvements in the quality of care for people with dementia"" and seven strategies to make this care more affordable. overall, the report authors say, governments need to make dementia a bigger priority. ""no two families are alike in their needs for care and support, and we need to find ways to make care more person-centred, and care packages more flexible and individualised,"" the report says. ""earlier diagnosis enables the person with dementia to make decisions about the care that they will receive."" alzheimer's disease cannot be prevented, cured or delayed. but experts say an earlier diagnosis may help patients live better day-to-day. the 10 warning signs of alzheimer's the alzheimer's association predicts that by 2050, u.s. costs for caring for the dementia population will total $1.2 trillion. to compare, the total cost worldwide in 2010 was about $604 billion. ""if dementia were a country, it would be the world's 21st largest economy,"" the report says, ""ranking between poland and saudi arabia."" garner went back to work full-time after jim lost his job, but she makes less than half what he did. the family used to go on vacations and go out to eat without stretching their budget too much. now, even back-to-school shopping is a financial burden. ""it's impacted us tremendously, and i don't even pay yet for care of him,"" garner said. ""when i have to hire someone for in-home care, which insurance doesn't cover, i have absolutely no idea how i'm going to do it."" when jim was diagnosed, she was a ""woman on fire,"" talking about alzheimer's all the time, asking jim about his bucket list, encouraging him to write letters and tape videos for their kids. but as time, and his disease, progress, her life has become a day-to-day struggle to live peacefully in the moment. unless someone has a family member with alzheimer's, she says, they can't understand the overwhelming frustration that comes with it. financially. emotionally. dealing with the medical system. planning for the future.

"on a sunny monday morning, over the open fields of baylands park in sunnyvale, california, an unmanned aerial vehicle was turning heads -- and it came with a cargo of carne asada. world, meet the burrito bomber. the bomber is the beans and rice-filled brainchild of two engineers at popular reviews and recommendations website, yelp. their ultimate goal is to send the burrito bomber into the wild, blue yonder, wait for a customer to place an order through a mobile app, then have the tortilla-toting plane do a fly-by delivery based on gps coordinates. ""you have a little parachute that kind of hides up here [under the plane],"" said yoni de beule, one of the plane's designers, ""and when the burrito releases, the parachute gets pulled out and allows for the burrito to drop to the ground a little more safely."" the bomber's engineers used a 3-d printer to create their own custom-made parts to allow for burrito storage and deployment, and added a fully remote controlled camera and transmitter to stream live video back down to the ground during flight. ""the plane can totally fly itself,"" says former yelp engineer john boiles, ""but these are nice to have as a backup."" that's right. the burrito bomber is a drone. although it currently has to be launched by hand -- and boiles briefly controls the drone as it ascends -- once the plane hits altitude and a flight plan is in place, the burrito bomber operates on its own. step one for takeoff includes boiles and de beule running through a checklist to ensure everything is operating properly. it's like their version of mission control, just down the road from the mission district, where yelp's headquarters are located in san francisco. step two is a little less technical. boiles grabs a few sprigs of grass and flips them into the air to see which way the breeze is blowing, sort of like nearby stanford university attendee tiger woods sizing up his approach to the 18th green. step three, flight. on the count of three, boiles fires up the propeller and de beule tosses the bomber into the air. after a brief wobble, the burrito bomber is soaring skyward and preparing to deploy its tasty payload. the idea of airborne munchies isn't entirely new. the tacocopter turned out to be a hoax. and domino's ""domicopter"" is a recent youtube sensation, showing a high-flying pizza delivery near london. the burrito bomber was dreamed up during a yelp hackathon -- a two-day event held every quarter where engineers tap into their creative side. yelp provides resources such as 3-d printers, tons of tools and lots of space -- a commodity in dense san francisco -- to keep their workers inspired. boiles and de beule's first hackathon project was a weather balloon they hoped would result in the first ever yelp ""check-in"" from space. however, the balloon flew a lot farther than expected and they later recovered it in the nevada desert. after a few other high-flying hijinks, the idea for the burrito bomber took hold. along with other projects from fellow engineers, boiles and de beule dubbed their creative corner of yelp headquarters darwin aerospace -- named after ceo jeremy stoppelman's dog, darwin, who is frequently found wandering yelp's offices. sadly, anyone hoping for an aerial munchies fix will have to keep hoping for a while. the burrito bomber is currently just a prototype. current federal aviation administration regulations prohibit commercial use of unmanned aircraft, but that could change. ""pending regulations from the faa in 2015, we'll be able to drop a burrito to a neighborhood near you,"" says boiles. until then, parachuting pico de gallo will have to wait.",engineers from yelp build the burrito bomber

""either playing a game of basketball, teaching or inspiring the game of basketball, there's been some great opportunities for me and there have been some great times with the kids here who love the game of basketball."" he then credited chinese former nba star yao ming as a role model. ""that's the most inspiring thing,"" james said. ""not only was yao in their backyard, he could also really play the game at a high level so it definitely helps a lot of kids as far as saying 'i can do this and i can do it at a high level.'"" the nba is one of the most followed sports leagues in china -- its account even has 52 million followers on weibo, china's twitter-like social network site. james was joined on court thursday by teammate and fellow superstar, dwayne wade, who has been recovering from off-season knee surgery, but played for several minutes even though it was only an exhibition game. wade even wore a pair of li-ning sneakers, just days after signing an endorsement deal with chinese sportswear company of the same name. the beijing-based company is giving the miami star his own line of shoes. the heat point guard becomes the biggest nba name to endorse the li-ning brand since his former miami teammate shaquille o'neal. but he's not the only nba star to endorse chinese products. heat forward shane battier has endorsed chinese sneakers brand peak since 2006. on the playing front, there has long been a well-established connection between the nba and the china basketball association (cba), the local professional league founded in 1995. several chinese players, such as yao, played in the cba before moving on to the nba. in 2011, the nba and cba launched a basketball academy to help train more coaches and players. during the nba lockdown last year, caused by dispute between nba players and owners, several stars, including jr smith and wilson chandler, played for chinese teams in the cba. china has also emerged as alternative destination for former nba stars in the twilight of their career. tracy mcgrady, 33, has reportedly signed a one-year deal to play this season with cba side, qingdao. the former all-star, who has played with several nba teams including the houston rockets, finished last season with the atlanta hawks. his long-time team up with now retired houston rockets center yao made mcgrady a popular figure in china. qingdao has never made it to the cba finals. his appearance in the cba is expected to attract more fans to domestic games.

"(cnn)former cycling champ lance armstrong struck two parked vehicles as he drove home from a night of partying but wasn't charged until his longtime girlfriend said she wasn't behind the wheel, according to police in aspen, colorado. armstrong, 43, was cited for two misdemeanors: duty to report accidents and exceeding the safe speed for conditions, police said. police served a summons on armstrong through his lawyer so armstrong was not questioned by police or quoted in the police report. the same charges had been filed against his girlfriend, anna hansen, 33, but were dropped after she admitted lying, the police report said. no other charges were filed. when asked if armstrong persuaded her to take the blame, hansen said, according to the police report: ""no, that was a joint decision and um, you know we've had our family name smeared over every paper in the world in the last couple of years and ... i thought, 'gosh, anna hansen hit some cars, it's not going to show up in the papers, but lance armstrong hit some cars, it's going to be a national story.' "" the arrest is another embarrassing incident for armstrong, who fell from grace after being one of the world's most revered and inspirational athletes. armstrong recovered from a near-fatal bout of testicular cancer and went on to win seven tour de frances, raising millions for cancer research and making millions for himself. but rumors he used performance-enhancing drugs dogged him for years. in 2012, the u.s. anti-doping agency filed a report alleging armstrong was at the center of a doping program during his heyday in cycling -- something armstrong had always denied. after he stopped contesting the doping allegations, armstrong was stripped of his tour de france titles and olympic cycling medal. he went on oprah winfrey's television network and admitted he doped and had lied about it. he was sued and lost endorsements. hansen told police she drove an suv home from an art museum party the night of december 28 because ""lance had a little bit to drink,"" the report said. she said she lost control on a snowy street, hit two parked vehicles, parked around the corner and provided contact information to the people renting the vehicles, the report said. she told them she and armstrong would pay for the damage and drove home, the report said. police talked to her the next day and got her side of the story. the officer was suspicious of hansen's story and talked to a car valet at the museum, who said armstrong drove away that night, the report said. on december 31, hansen talked to police again, this time with her lawyer, and changed her story to say armstrong was the driver. when the officer asked if armstrong was intoxicated, as she earlier indicated, hansen said, according to the report: ""he was not intoxicated, and that was um, you know, i'm sorry i lied to you that morning but i was trying to make it sound like, well, i was driving because that was just, i don't know, i'm not in the habit of lying in general and especially not to police officers so, i don't know, i was just trying to make something up at that time."" she said armstrong is ""prepared to admit driving the car and accept responsibility for the crash,"" the report said. armstrong is scheduled to appear in pitkin county court on march 17.","aspen, colorado, police cite former cycling champ lance armstrong with two traffic offenses"
"nigeria, africa's largest oil producer, ended oil subsidies on new year's day that had kept gasoline prices artificially low. the cost of a liter of gasoline shot up from 65 naira (40 cents) to at least 141 naira (86 cents) virtually overnight. furious nigerians have since taken to the streets, staging 'occupy nigeria' protests and mass demonstrations across the country. police have responded forcefully with many arrests. at least one person has died amid the unrest: 23-year-old student muyideen mustafa was allegedly hit by a police bullet in ilorin, kwara state, on january 03. are you there? send your images or video a police spokesman in kano state also confirmed to cnn that they fired teargas into a crowd staging a midnight protest last week in order to disperse a largely peaceful demonstration by muslims and christians. what is the background to the decision? the government is attempting to deregulate the oil sector in the country and believes subsidizing consumption of oil is a drain on public finances that will prove unsustainable in the long term. many argue that the only people the subsidy benefited were fuel importers. the government says the move will save the treasury more than 1 trillion naira ($6.13 billion) in 2012. reuben abati, spokesman for president goodluck jonathan, told cnn the money saved from removing the subsidy will help to improve public amenities and build much-needed infrastructure in a country with poor roads, lack of power and non-functioning refineries. nigeria produces around 2.4 million barrels of crude oil a day but imports roughly 70% of its gasoline from countries as far afield as the united kingdom and venezuela, because its own refineries are inoperative after years of corruption-fueled neglect. why has it caused such an outcry? nigerians are angry because they believe the government has introduced the plan without any regard to how it will affect the cost of living in the country. they say they are already experiencing undue hardship as a result of the move, which they say has already affected the cost of transport, food, medicine, rent and school fees. feyi fawehinmi, an accountant and analyst, told cnn the government's abrupt move was like having a ""tooth pulled without a plier."" ""when you have so much poverty, a lot of business and lives have been built on petrol being at n65, which is not exactly cheap, even at subsidized rates. people are just not moving out of poverty quickly in nigeria. there is an economic case but this is not something that can be quantified economically,"" he said. ""the government cannot tell how many businesses will be ruined or even how many people will die,"" fawehinmi continued. ""the impact will be so wide-ranging. there should have been a plan to remove this in a sensible way, not in this crude manner."" he said. many nigerians see the subsidy, which gives them the cheapest gas price in the region, as the only benefit of being an oil producing country. most live in grinding poverty and on less than $2 a day. there is little infrastructure, high unemployment and only intermittent electric power. nigerians routinely have to buy generators to provide power and supporters of the subsidies say some may be left in the dark because they simply cannot afford fuel costs. is there an economic case for the removal? those who support ending the subsidy removal say the move is long overdue because of simple economics. they argue that nigerians have been paying n65 (40 cents) per liter for at least five years, while petrol prices have risen significantly elsewhere in the world, which means the government foots the bill when worldwide oil prices go up. they also say that the only people who get any real benefit from the subsidy are those involved in importing oil. the nigerian oil traders import refined gasoline, claim the subsidy and then sell it on at a higher rate to neighboring countries. how will nigerians benefit from any money saved? there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure it says it will. nigeria is regularly voted among the most corrupt countries in the world and citizens complain that the money saved will be siphoned by a few and salted away into off-shore accounts, as has happened in the past. they also bemoan the high salaries and daily allowances of government officials. according to transparency for nigeria website, the country's senators receive an annual pay of n182m ($1.2m). the national monthly minimum wage is set at n18,000 ($112), although all nigerians do not currently receive this basic wage. while at the 2012 national expenditure reading in december, n992.57m alone ($6.2m) was allocated for the president and vice president's annual food and general catering services. the sum includes the cost of purchasing foodstuffs, catering supplies and kitchen equipment for the president and his deputy's offices and residences, according to the 2012 appropriation bill presented to the nigerian national assembly. however, government spokesman reuben abati told cnn he understood nigerians' concerns regarding a lack of trust because they had been let down by previous administrations. he added that the president has set up a high-powered committee to ensure money saved from ending the subsidy would not be misappropriated. what will happen next? mass unrest and instability in the country is expected over the next few days, with citizens calling for a return to the cheap prices. so far, the government has refused but has announced the ""immediate distribution of 1600 mass transit buses to major cities."" labor union leaders have called for national strikes and protests that they hope will lead to a mass shutdown across the country. ""we call on all nigerians to participate actively in this movement to rescue our country. the emphasis is on peaceful protests, rallies and strikes while refusing to be intimidated,"" the unions' statement said. there are also calls from some quarters for president jonathan to be impeached.",nigeria's government removed fuel subsidy on new year's day ending

"-- engineers used a flying drone to peer into the damaged reactors at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant sunday as the crisis spurred more than 2,000 people to march against nuclear energy in tokyo. ""i was just a couch potato critic, but here we are today with friends for the first time, and i'm sure it's the first time for a lot of people today,"" said karima asuma stickan, one of the protesters. monday marks a full month in the battle to prevent a worse disaster at fukushima daiichi, which was battered by the earthquake and resulting tsunami that struck northern japan on march 11. japan's largest utility, tokyo electric power company, has been struggling to cool down three damaged reactors and prevent a wider release of radioactivity than has already occurred. improvisation, frustration in week four of crisis a camera was mounted on a remote-controlled helicopter to get pictures of the damaged reactors from above sunday in hopes of getting a better look at the damaged housings of the no. 1, 3 and 4 reactors and hopefully the pools of spent fuel inside, company spokesman junichi matsumoto said. the drone hovered over the plant for 28 minutes at an altitude of about 150 meters (492 feet), he said. the t-hawk drone, built by the u.s. company honeywell, can transmit ordinary pictures as well as infrared images, matsumoto told reporters. images captured by the drone are expected to be released monday, he said. in addition, the company is now using remote-controlled heavy machinery to clear away debris outside the plant and has begun the process of laying new pipes to start pumping radioactive water out of the flooded basements of the turbine plants behind units 1 through 3. driving into japan's radiation zone one worker fell ill during the work on sunday, the company said. the man, in his 30s, was placing hoses for collecting the contaminated water from reactor no. 2 when he became ill, nearly two hours into his shift. the subcontractor was taken to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with exhaustion, tokyo electric said. he was exposed to 4.82 millisieverts of radiation, but no radioactive substances were found on his body. his cumulative exposure is 16 millisieverts, well below the 250-millisievert limit for workers in the plant. he was with a group of 30 subcontractors working in the area, and was wearing protective gear, the company said. japan launches new search for quake victims the man had been working four-hour shifts since march 23, tokyo electric said. it was unclear whether he had received a day off. meanwhile, two of the world's largest concrete pumps were en route to japan on sunday as part of the effort to help resolve the crisis. the pumps left the united states on saturday -- one from los angeles and the other from atlanta, said bill dwyer, vice president of sales and marketing for putzmeister america, the pumps' manufacturer. although the pumps were built to pump concrete, they can be modified to pump water at high pressure, with a 230-feet reach and ""pinpoint accuracy,"" dwyer said sunday. ""it allows workers to work from a greater distance,"" he said. one pump is set to arrive in japan on monday and the second on tuesday, he said. workers have been pouring hundreds of tons of fresh water a day into the three damaged reactors and the spent fuel pools of units 1-4 to keep them cool until normal circulation systems can be restored. the no. 2 reactor is believed to be leaking highly radioactive water, some of which had been spilling into the pacific until wednesday, while flooded basements in the turbine plants of all three units are making it impossible to restore power, company officials say. to make room for the fluid, tokyo electric has been dumping less contaminated water into the pacific ocean from a waste treatment facility on the site. that process -- which also includes the release of radioactive water from the drainage basins beneath reactors 5 and 6 -- was nearly complete sunday evening, japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency reported. the radioactive particles in the water are dispersing into the ocean. but concentrations of radioactive iodine-131 remained 25 times higher than the japanese legal standard in water sampled 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of the plant on saturday. that's down from 93 times the limit on wednesday, according to sampling data released sunday. levels of longer-lived cesium-137, which takes 30 years to lose half its radioactivity, remained nearly six times the legal limit but well below levels reported earlier this week. the discharge was billed as an emergency measure, but it infuriated japan's fishing industry and drew protests from neighboring south korea. and participants in sunday's protest in shiba park, at the foot of the landmark tokyo tower, expressed concern about the long-term effects of the radioactive releases so far. japanese turn in cash found in tsunami zone ""the air pollution gets into the lungs,"" said dr. nobuhiko murapsu, a pulmonary care physician from chiba prefecture, north of tokyo.

""the problem is, i think i'm not sure they know the whole picture themselves,"" mikami said.

"-- the decision of english premier league giants manchester united to ban their players from signing autographs at the team's training ground won't affect the sports memorabilia market significantly, an industry expert says. sorry kids: manchester united will no longer be giving autographs at their carrington training ground. the move to ban autographs was announced by sir alex ferguson in the team's match day program for saturday's 2-1 win over blackburn rovers at old trafford. ferguson said in the program he wanted to put a stop to memorabilia dealers using the autographs for financial gain. ""i offer apologies to fans who come to the carrington training ground looking for autographs, he wrote. ""the problem is that we have had too many opportunists selling on signed merchandise. they are not fans at all,"" ferguson said. while the independent manchester united supporters' association declined to comment on the issue, a spokesman from a kent-based supporters' club ""invicta reds"" said he was happy to agree with the manager's decision.

""it has definitely been growing, it's big business. in the past, people hadn't realized the price they could get for some of these items. ""the power of the internet has changed this. however, with more players signing more autographs, the market is a little flooded with the items,"" he said. gallucci said less accessibility to players for some fans shouldn't alter the market too much as the items sourced from official routes were usually the most popular. ""people who want a 100 percent genuine item will buy through a company where they can verify the authenticity,"" he said. a spokeswoman for ebay said the trading of football memorabilia was very popular on the site and had grown in recent years. more than 90,000 items had been listed in the last three months, and ebay had noticed ""a shift in people starting to sell their memorabilia on the site to make money,"" the spokeswoman told cnn. in the u.s. market, players in sports such as baseball sometimes only signed autographed items on pre-arranged and contracted deals with memorabilia companies, galluci said. a 2007 forbes magazine list rating the top ten sports collectibles ranked baseball star mark mcgwire's record 70th home-run ball as the most expensive -- with an estimated value of $3,005,000. all of the top ten items on the list are baseball memorabilia. see the list here.",manchester united have banned players from giving autographs at training

"-- at the heart of florida researchers' high-tech efforts to protect black bears is a rather low-tech tool: day-old doughnuts. a young bear sits next to a pine tree after being snared by one of the traps set by researchers. researchers use the doughnuts and other stale pastries to bait traps for the bears. once snared, the bears are tranquilized and then fitted with a gps collar. using cell phone technology, every 15 minutes the collar sends a text message that tells researchers where the bear is located. tracking the bears' movements -- or lack thereof -- is important. dr. john cox, head of the south-central florida bear project, said the bear population, in order to stay healthy, must be able to travel to different locations throughout the state. they need to travel between different bear populations. but that mobility has been decreasing. there was a time, cox said, when the bears were free to roam the entire state. as development increased, however, the black bear lost much of its habitat. and the habitat that remained has become more fragmented due to development, primarily roads. the result: the bears become more isolated, with inbreeding within that isolated population. ""this population of bears is actually losing genetic diversity,"" cox said. ""you see that loss of healthy genes in the population over time. ""that is a sign of isolation."" having the bears wear the gps collars is ""wonderful because the bears are telling us what habitat we need to protect,"" said tricia martin of the nature conservancy. as of now, 55 black bears in the area have been fitted with collars. watch the researchers at work » researchers want to know whether the bears' travels have them crossing a road, an orange grove, or somewhere else in order to get from place to place. collecting data on the corridors the bears need to travel will help in pinpointing what land should be sought for conservation purposes. but first the bears must be snared -- and that's where the doughnuts come in. ""the doughnuts are a good bait, they can smell and it'll bring them in,"" said wade ulrey, one of the researchers with the south-central florida bear project. recently a young female bear was found in a snare trap -- lured there by the doughnuts, or perhaps the brownie with whipped cream and a cherry that also had been placed there. ulrey and fellow university of kentucky research scientist joe guthrie slowly approached the trapped bear. the animal, with a cable around its paw, tried to climb a pine tree to escape. see photos of a snared bear » the researchers waited for the bear to calm down, then they injected her with a tranquilizer that was at the end of an 8-foot-long pole. as they waited for the drug to take effect, ulrey and guthrie returned to their truck to gather the tools they needed to examine the bear. ""we have a couple of bags of ice here to help keep her cool,"" ulrey said as he placed the bags under the legs and arms of the unconscious bear. the team scanned the 2½-year-old and realized she already had a microchip implanted under her skin. ""it's similar to an id system used for pets,"" said ulrey. the chip tells the researchers that this bear was caught in 2007, when she was a cub still roaming florida with her mother. the researchers weighed and measured the bear. then ulrey used tweezers to pull out a bit of hair. ""we can get a dna sample from this to see if she is related to any other bears we've captured in the area,"" ulrey said. this young black bear, however, won't be telling researchers where she will be traveling. she is too young to be outfitted with a gps collar. ninety minutes later, the tranquilizer wears off. the bear is awake and appears unharmed. ""usually the things you'll see is a little bit of an abrasion where they've rubbed some of the fur off, or maybe a cut,"" cox said when asked about the danger of using a snare trap. as this young cub wanders off, the research team can only hope she finds a road less traveled -- and stays off the highways.","researchers in south florida capture bears, outfit them with gps collars"

"-- two years ago, karen daniel was wider around than she was tall. ""it's a lot harder to be fat than it is to work so hard at being fit,"" says karen daniel who has lost 175 pounds. weighing 375 pounds, the 45-year-old wife and mother had high blood pressure; her knees hurt and she was always hot. she felt fatigued and could barely breathe at the slightest exertion. even the simplest things became a chore -- tying her shoes, crossing her legs, getting in and out of the car or trying to fit into a chair with arms. ""i wasn't living ... i was just existing,"" recalled daniel. she hadn't always struggled with her weight. daniel said she started gaining weight at age 18 after moving out of her parents' home to live on her own. by the time she married her husband, paul, at age 22, she weighed 225 pounds. ""whenever something happened, i used food,"" said daniel. ""it was like my drug of choice was food. i never did drugs or alcohol. i was addicted to food."" seven months after her wedding and another 50 pounds later, daniel became pregnant with her first child. instead of gaining weight during the pregnancy, she lost 75 pounds after a doctor warned her not to use it as an excuse to eat. but after her daughter sarah was born, daniel gained back all the weight she'd lost and then some. ten years later, she weighed 300 pounds and became pregnant with their second child, mckenna. again, she lost weight during the pregnancy, but with the stress of having another child and running her own business, she turned to food. by the time her youngest daughter was 10 years old, daniel weighed 375 pounds. ""i ate all the time. ... i was stuffing my emotions, i was eating my emotions,"" said daniel. ""when i would finally get [mckenna] to bed at night, i would stay up late and that was my time alone. i tried to de-stress and wind down and i'd watch tv and eat. it was mindless eating."" mentally, something started to click and daniel began to wonder how and why she had allowed her weight to spiral out of control. she said there was no ""lightbulb"" moment or wake-up call that made her realize she'd had enough. for her, there was a series of events that helped her finally realize she was tired of being morbidly obese. watch karen daniel take flight to achieve a lifelong dream » ""i couldn't bend over to tie my shoes, get down on the ground or fit into chairs. everything was hard,"" said daniel. ""you're constantly worried about fitting on the toilet or in the shower or visiting someone's house and [worrying] about breaking a chair. it affects every minute of your life and you don't realize it."" as fate would have it, she saw a tv commercial for exercise equipment that was being sold at a local gym. it was geared toward senior citizens, but daniel saw it as a start. when she showed up to buy it, she met the gym's owner, bill crawford. ""he gave me some of his literature and told me if i needed anything or a jump-start to give him a call,"" said daniel. see daniel's before-and-after photos » when daniel got home, she told her sister, jan, she was thinking about hiring crawford as her personal trainer, but she was hesitant. her sister asked if she would have to think twice about hiring a trainer if it were for her husband or daughters. ""she made me realize i was worth it as much as they were,"" said daniel, whose fear of failure kept her from telling people outside her family about her plans to work out. on september 15, 2006, daniel showed up for her first training session. she was wearing a dress over her workout clothes because she refused to be seen in size 40w pants. ""when karen first walked in the door, she weighed 375 pounds and she could barely make it from the car to the front door,"" recalled crawford, founder of basic training in phoenix, arizona. ""i knew that just making it to the front door of a fitness center was a big deal."" before her first workout, crawford took her measurements, but the tape measure wasn't long enough to fit around her hips. he needed seven more inches. ""i was 67 inches around on my butt and 65 inches tall. so i was two inches bigger around than i was tall,"" said daniel, who had a body fat percentage of 54.60 percent. ""i also couldn't fit on his scale or in some of his machines when i started."" crawford and daniel improvised and she made it through her first hourlong workout. she continued to train for one hour, three times a week and said even though she ""hated every minute of it"" she pushed herself. ""it was extremely hard, i'm not gonna lie,"" said daniel. ""i couldn't count down the minutes fast enough. it was something i did not enjoy -- i was so out of breath. i was sweaty, hot. but as soon as i stepped out that door, it was so worth it to me because i felt so much better about what i had accomplished. i knew i made it through one more workout. i knew it was getting me closer to where i wanted to be."" in addition to the one-on-one training sessions, daniel modified her diet, eating more proteins and complex carbohydrates. she also eliminated bread and pasta and reduced her intake of sugar, salt and processed foods. if she craved something sweet, she ate a piece of fruit. she cooked with olive oil instead of butter. just short of her one-year anniversary, she had lost 102 pounds. her daughters gave her a tiffany bracelet and her sister, jan, treated her to her first pedicure. crawford, her trainer, celebrated her success with a reminder. ""i had her take two 50-pound dumbbells and walk out to the street and walk back,"" recalled crawford. ""when she got back she was exhausted and that's the kind of weight people have to carry when they're overweight like that."" on her one-year anniversary, daniel had lost 114 pounds. by her two-year anniversary on september 15, 2008, she had lost 170 pounds. now weighing around 200 pounds, she has gone from wearing a women's size 30 dress to a size 14 and she's gone from wearing a double-wide shoe to a medium width. since losing the weight, daniel has celebrated many milestones she never would have achieved weighing nearly 400 pounds, such as attending sporting events with her family, white-water rafting, kayaking, flying on an airplane without buying two tickets or using a seatbelt extender or simply being able to look down and see her feet. she recently achieved one of her lifelong dreams: riding in a hot air balloon over the arizona desert. today, she works out nine times a week -- doing cardio and weight training twice a day with crawford on monday, wednesday and friday. then she does a mix of cardio and weight-resistance classes on tuesday, thursday and saturday. even though she now enjoys working out, staying on track is a constant struggle. daniel said losing weight has been the hardest thing she's ever done. ""every minute of my life was about my weight. what i couldn't do. things i couldn't accomplish,"" said daniel, who admitted it was hard to get started. ""it's a lot harder to be fat than it is to work so hard at being fit. fit feels so good."" what's next for daniel? she wants to lose 35 to 40 more pounds before her 48th birthday and keep adding to the list of things she wants to do to make sure she savors every moment. most of all, daniel hopes to inspire others by sharing her weight-loss story on her web site, www.ihavebones.com. ""i just wish they would take the first step, because it's so worth it. your life is so much better than worrying about where you're going to sit and how you're going to sit. you can actually ... enjoy life!"" matt sloane contributed to this report.","at her heaviest, karen daniel weighed 375 pounds; she was 67 inches around"

"-- literary circles were abuzz after three previously unpublished short stories by american author j.d. salinger showed up on the internet this week. the reported works by the reclusive writer of ""the catcher in the rye"" appeared numerous places online, including upload sites imgur and mediafire. they were previously only available for academic study. the 41-page album is simply called ""three stories."" it contains these offerings: ""the ocean full of bowling balls,"" ""birthday boy"" and ""paula."" so, could this be legit? los angeles times book critic david l. ulin says yes. ""i've never read ""the ocean full of bowling balls"": it's part of a collection of salinger material at the princeton university library and available only to scholars who are supervised as they read,"" he said in the online edition of the paper. ""i have read the other two stories, however, at the university of texas' ransom center, and the versions of them in 'three stories' are the real deal."" another affirmation comes from salinger scholar kenneth slawenski, author of ""j.d. salinger: a life,"" who talked with buzzfeed. ""while i do quibble with the ethics (or lack of ethics) in posting the salinger stories, they look to be true transcripts of the originals and match my own copies,"" slawenski told buzzfeed in an e-mail. princeton had its own theories on how the stories could have made it to the public. ""the story is probably an unauthorized version transcribed longhand in our reading room,"" said martin mbugua, a princeton spokesman. ""it's also possible that it came from photocopies of the typescript probably made before the mid-1980s when we decided that we would no longer allow photo-duplication for any work by salinger."" but several reports point to a september auction on ebay of ""three stories unpublished jd salinger (catcher in the rye) first edition"" which went for about $110, as the source of the online material. the pages were scanned and uploaded, the reports suggest. a photo included with the listing says it was first printed in london in 1999 and identifies it as copy number six out of 25 numbered copies. ironically, the page also says: ""the three stories in this book remain unpublished and locked by j. d. salinger for publishing."" salinger was known to fiercely guard his writings and only allowed a relatively small number to be published before his death in 2010 at age 91. rare book sells for $14.2 million",the previously unpublished stories appeared online this week

"the steady drumbeat of preparations for some sort of a u.s. strike in syria is stirring up old anxieties. americans have no appetite for another military campaign in a foreign land. syria feels far away; a tragedy, no doubt, but to many who strongly oppose any kind of intervention, it is simply too removed, too complicated, too foreign to view as an american problem. military action, the skeptics rightly say, has consequences, often unpredictable ones. but so does inaction. inaction is more dangerous -- potentially riskier and costlier -- than smart, limited intervention. syria may seem far away, but every passing day, every calamitous, explosive, hate-infused day, makes it more america's -- and the world's -- problem. here are five reasons why: 1) other dictators are watching: when the president of the united states says the use of chemical weapons is a ""red line,"" other dangerous regimes pay very close attention to see what he means. if that line is crossed -- as is gruesomely visible in syria -- and nothing happens, it sends a clear signal to current and future powers that may threaten american interests and fundamental international norms. the message that america's warnings can be ignored, that the international community's warnings can be disregarded, is most welcome in places like iran and north korea, whose pursuits of weapons are a threat not just to the united states but to the entire world. syria: chemical weapons -- how did we get here? 2) chemical weapons will be used in future battlegrounds: more than 100,000 people have been killed in syria. that alone should stir the conscience of humanity. but there is something uniquely dangerous about the introduction of chemical weapons. horrified by the effects of chemical weapons in the battlefield, nations have come together over the years to develop international bans on nerve gases, blister agents, blood agents and choking agents. the syrian government, by all appearances, used nerve gas to kill hundreds of its own citizens. if it passes without a response, this will not be the last time we see these weapons in use -- and not just in a distant battlefield. chemical weapons are not only appealing to dictators refusing to relinquish power, but they also could make an appearance in other wars, and they are ideal for terrorist groups seeking to inflict maximum fear. gingrich: stay out of syria's civil war 3) the war is spreading, the choices are worsening: the united states has largely kept its distance in the syrian civil war. two years ago, president obama declared that president bashar al-assad must go. a year ago, he drew his famous red line. but any hope that the situation would somehow resolve itself has only produced the worst possible outcome. the u.s. should have provided material and logistical help to the more moderate among the rebels early on. failure to do so resulted in today's terrible dearth of good choices, in which america wants al-assad to fall, but the opposition is dominated by extremist jihadists, some of them affiliated with al qaeda. in the meantime, the war is bursting beyond syrian borders. millions of syrians have fled their homes, straining resources and occasionally raining fire into jordan, lebanon, turkey, iraq and even israel. the war threatens to engulf the region. the middle east remains the most explosive region of the world. it produces a big portion of oil supplies and it lies at the crossroads of global commerce. this is the last place to allow a wildfire to spread before trying to affect its direction and ultimately extinguish it. opinion: why western intervention in syria will leave chaos 4) inaction will hand a victory to al-assad, iran and hezbollah: the obama administration is telegraphing an attack against syria aimed at punishing al-assad and sending a message to the world, rather than seeking to change the course of this civil war. but the course of the war matters. without forceful american action, al-assad's latest maneuvers constitute a victory for his regime and its top allies, iran and hezbollah. giving a boost to this alliance runs counter to regional and global peace and stability. iran and hezbollah have a nefarious track record. they have carried out a wave of terrorist attacks in asia, europe and latin america. just last week a judge in thailand sentenced an iranian man to life in prison for his role in a terrorist plot against israeli diplomats in bangkok. iranian and hezbollah agents have been implicated in terrorist plots in argentina, cyprus, bulgaria, india and elsewhere. even if you don't care about syria or the middle east, handing a victory to this dangerous threesome should worry everyone. 'red line' debate: chemical weapons worse than attacks? 5) a new generation of hatred will perpetuate this tragedy: the war in syria has raged for 2½ years. during that time, it has descended into ever greater levels of brutality and carnage. it has also become increasingly sectarian. it all started as a peaceful uprising demanding a dictator step down and allow a democratic government representing the different religions and ethnicities in syria. it is now a hate-filled maelstrom of sunnis, shiites, allawites, christians, kurds and others. people are being killed based on their community of origin. this is how you create hatreds that burn through the ages, enduring for generations of revenge-seeking, and triggering new wars. the longer this fire rages, the more likely its sparks will start new fires, far into the future. the united states and its friends should strike al-assad in a way that shows the world will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons, and prove that america's threats and international commitments have meaning and muscle. beyond that, washington should do what it should have done long ago. without sending any u.s. troops into syria, the united states and its allies should find and strengthen the more moderate members of the opposition so they will gain the upper hand against extremists within opposition ranks. then they can remove al-assad from power by wining what is, most assuredly, their war, the syrians' war, but one that is of great consequence to america and to the rest of the world.",frida ghitis: u.s. inaction in syria is risky; the situation endangers the world
"-- a bipartisan group of senators is scrambling to reach a fresh compromise they hope can propel a proposal to overhaul u.s. immigration policy toward passage in that chamber and provide momentum heading into the republican-controlled house. a deal remained elusive, however, on tuesday evening and it was uncertain whether the stark differences that have stalled immigration reform for years in congress could be bridged with time running out on debate. raising new questions on whether any immigration bill will get through congress this year, house speaker john boehner said earlier in the day that he did not see any way of bringing a bill on that issue to the floor that relied on democrats to pass. under enormous pressure from conservatives opposed to the bipartisan senate bill, boehner has until now sidestepped questions about how he would move forward. ""i don't see any way of bringing an immigration bill to the floor that doesn't have majority support of republicans,"" he told reporters following a closed-door gop conference meeting where a source said he made similar comments to reassure members. efforts to push forward immigration reform are emotionally charged as the issue has huge political stakes for both sides. president barack obama and democrats want to fulfill a promise to hispanic americans, the nation's fastest-growing demographic, to address the limbo of immigrants living illegally in the country and maintain their overall support. republican strategists are concerned about the gop's long term viability in national elections if it does not win over the important voting bloc, which went strongly for obama in november. the senate bill negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators dubbed the ""gang of eight"" proposes a path to citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants in the united states. but conservatives consider any measure offering a path to citizenship tantamount to amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. in addition, concerns about whether the bill will tighten security along the nation's porous borders, as asserted by backers of the plan, may make it difficult for conservatives to support it -- especially those up for re-election next year. debate began last week and senators have been sorting through amendments. sen. marco rubio, a key player in the senate debate, senses that significant progress has been made in trying to bridge the gap. ""i think we're on the right track,"" the florida republican said. during a series of afternoon votes, members of the ""gang of eight"" huddled on the floor and separately with other key senators -- twisting arms, cajoling, convincing. in a rare scene, a large group of republicans anxiously worked the room seeking compromises. the ""gang of eight"" and sen. bob corker, a tennessee republican, and sen. john hoeven, a north dakota republican, are attempting to broker a compromise. as of now, it would tighten border security requirements primarily by having congress dictate exactly how secure the border must be before immigrants in the united states illegally can begin the process of gaining citizenship. by shifting that responsibility to congress and away from the executive branch, negotiators hope to pick up support from republican senators who are reluctant to leave that determination to the administration. 5 things to know about immigration reform the emerging deal also would include several other republican priorities related to entry and exit biometrics, the e-verify workplace verification program, and rules that would prevent immigrants from getting public benefits. ""corker and i are trying to get enough of these together so you can get a meaningful bipartisan group on the bill,"" explained hoeven, who said he hoped to introduce the proposal as early as wednesday. a package of amendments is ""something that creates a momentum around the building that people are seeking,"" said corker. senate majority leader harry reid said time was critical as he threatened to end debate on the bill soon in order to keep a promise to finish the bill by the end of the month. love or country: immigration law means hard choices for gay couples 5 things to know about immigration reform a bipartisan group of seven house members -- three republicans and four democrats -- is still finalizing its own comprehensive immigration bill that mirrors many of the provisions in the senate bill, including eventual citizenship for undocumented workers. a cnn/orc poll released tuesday shows a small majority of americans support the approach in the senate bill. the poll shows that 51% say they support a bill that would attempt to increase border security and create a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, with 45% saying they are opposed to such a measure. cnn poll: big generational divide in immigration battle",new: key senators seek new compromise on immigration with time running short
"-- the leader of this week's coup in guinea assured senior officials thursday ""they are safe,"" a journalist with the state-run newspaper told cnn. capt. moussa dadis camara with prime minister ahmed tidiane souare. coup leader capt. moussa dadis camara met with prime minister ahmed tidiane souare and about 30 other top officials at a military camp in conakry, the nation's capital, said ousmane barry, a correspondent for the state-run horoya newspaper. camara has declared himself president of the national council for democracy, which he called a transitional body that will oversee the country's return to democracy. in effect, that makes camara president of guinea, which was thrown into turmoil monday after the death of president lansana conte. souare called camara ""mr. president"" at thursday's meeting, which was witnessed by journalists, barry said. the two men also discussed conte's funeral, scheduled for friday. camara has suspended the government, constitution, political parties and trade unions and formed his own government, africa news reporter mamdou dian donghol diallo told cnn on wednesday. the newly formed government, made up of 26 military personnel and six civilians, is negotiating a power-sharing deal that would reflect its ethnic make-up, diallo said. international institutions, including the african union, have condemned the coup. ""what we want to see is the transition to a more democratic governing structure for the people of guinea,"" u.s. state department spokesman sean mccormack said earlier this week. guinea, in western africa bordering the atlantic ocean, has had only two presidents since gaining independence from france in 1958. conte came to power in 1984, when the military seized control of the government after the death of the first president, sekou toure. the country did not hold democratic elections until 1993, when conte was elected president. he was re-elected in 1998 and 2003 amid allegations of electoral irregularities. worsening economic conditions and dissatisfaction with corruption and bad governance prompted two massive strikes in 2006, the cia world factbook says. a third nationwide strike in early 2007 sparked violent protests that resulted in two weeks of martial law. to appease the unions and end the unrest, the factbook says, conte named a new prime minister in march 2007.","safety guarantees given to leading guinea officials, reporter tells cnn"
"-- olympic hero michael phelps was suspended from competitive swimming for three months on thursday -- just hours after one of his sponsors announced it would not renew his contract after a photo surfaced of him smoking from a bong. michael phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" after a photo of him smoking from a bong was published. usa swimming, the nation's governing body for competitive swimming, said it was withdrawing financial support for phelps and barring him from competition during the period of his ""reprimand."" ""this is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated, but we decided to send a strong message to michael because he disappointed so many people, particularly the hundreds of thousands of usa swimming-member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero,"" they said in a statement. ""michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust,"" the statement continued. earlier thursday, kellogg co. said it will not renew phelps' advertising contract. ""michael's most recent behavior is not consistent with the image of kellogg,"" company spokeswoman susanne norwitz said. ""his contract expires at the end of february, and we have made a decision not to extend his contract."" norwitz said kellogg's relationship with phelps began with the company's support of the u.s. olympic team. kellogg did not renew its sponsorship of the team when it expired in december, she said. phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" on sunday after a british newspaper published the photograph. the tabloid news of the world showed phelps using the bong during what it said was a november party at the university of south carolina in columbia. the richland county, south carolina, sheriff's office said tuesday it was investigating whether phelps smoked marijuana on the school campus, adding it would file criminal charges if it determined he did. both university police and columbia, south carolina, police said they would not pursue charges, according to the state newspaper in columbia. it was unclear where the party took place, the paper said, or whether it was on campus. on thursday, before the decisions by usa swimming and kellogg were announced, phelps told cnn affiliate wbal that the incident was a result of ""bad judgment."" watch phelps' comments to wbal » ""i can learn from it and try to make my life better than it has been in the past,"" he told wbal. ""i think it's hard to really be ready for any of this. but i've actually been able to talk to a lot of people, and lot of people that have been in my shoes in other sports, and i've been able to get their perspective and just talk to them a little bit, and that's been helpful over the last few days,"" phelps said. in a statement released sunday, phelps, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 olympic games in beijing, china, said: ""i engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment."" ""i'm 23 years old, and despite the successes i have had in the pool, i acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me,"" he said. ""for this, i am sorry. i promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again."" ireport.com: should phelps have been suspended? the u.s. olympic committee also issued a statement that said in part: ""michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions. we are confident that, going forward, michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great olympic champion."" in 2004, phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in salisbury, maryland. he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. he also issued an apology after that incident. phelps is one of 12 olympic athletes who pledged to ""my victory,"" an initiative launched last year by the u.s. anti-doping agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean.",usa swimming suspends michael phelps from competition for three months
"-- terrace crowds are controlled by men wearing army fatigues and holding kalashnikov rifles, players and press pray on the pitch at half-time and when the final whistle is blown, the trophy is handed to the winning captain by one of israel's most wanted men. welcome to football, gaza style. more than 5,000 fans crammed into the palestine stadium in gaza city for what is an increasingly rare occasion these days: a game of football. the ""gaza dialogue and tolerance cup final"" between al shate (a mixed team of hamas and fatah members that represents the 80,000 strong al shate refugee camp) played al salah islamic association (a team aligned with hamas) in a tight match in front of raucous fans who flew blue and yellow flags and fired off flames from lit cans of hairspray in support of their side. however, as with most things in the gaza strip, war, politics and internal divisions are never far away. the beautiful game is inordinately popular in the tiny strip of 1.5 million people. the palestinian national football squad has no less than 15 players representing gaza and over the past 50 years dozens of teams have flourished, each with its own affiliation to different political groups. even hamas' ismail haniyeh -- the de facto palestinian prime minister who is a high-profile fugitive from israeli authorities -- has a soft spot for the game. in his youth he was a talented, no-nonsense defender for al shate, his home neighborhood. to underline the importance of the match, designed to promote harmony between political factions, haniyeh turned up to present the cup. but since hamas, a militant islamist group, seized control of gaza from fatah in 2007, football has been brought to the brink of extinction. hamas did more than take over gaza's political and economic apparatus. they also took over all of gaza's top sports and football clubs. ""we as sports people want to remove sport from politics but politicians on both sides, hamas and fatah, play on this, they try to make politics come into sport,"" explained ibraheem abu saleem, vice president of the palestinian football association [pfa] and the man in charge of the game in gaza. ""the main problem lies with hamas. when hamas hands back the clubs to their legal board of directors, sport will be running again in gaza as in the west bank."" angered by the political intrusion in sport, the pfa, based in the west bank, refused to organize a league until the teams were handed back. hamas declined and the football league has been dormant ever since the putsch. instead the clubs have been left to organize their own small, increasingly irregular tournaments. the best players simply left for the west bank, but since israel's war in gaza last winter, that exodus has been halted due to movement restrictions. in comparison football in the fatah-controlled west bank is thriving. the league was non existent three years ago. now palestinians turn up in huge numbers to matches, sometimes attracting as many as 15,000 fans. private businesses have poured money into sponsoring their favorite teams and a brand new stadium was built on the outskirts of east jerusalem to host the palestinian national team's first ever home international last year. ""here in the west bank we have two members of hamas on the board. we have teams for hamas, the pflp [popular front for the liberation of palestine],"" said jibril rajoub, president of the pfa, a former national security advisor to yasser arafat and a leading member of fatah recently elected to the fatah central committee. ""there is a wall here between politics and factionalism in sport [in the west bank]. i think the same should happen in gaza."" back in gaza, al shate and their non-aligned fans left the happier, securing a 2-0 victory. but for the players, stuck between hamas and the pfa, it was bittersweet. ""the takeover of the clubs is the main reason for us not having any competition and i want hamas to give the clubs back,"" agreed hamada shbair, the winning captain of al shate and a palestinian international who hasn't played for the national team since 2008 because of israeli and egyptian travel restrictions. shbair celebrated along with thousands of fans who carried their cup from the stadium back to the camp in procession. it was the first silverware in a quarter of a century for al shate, who have so far escaped the hamas takeover. but shbair used the victory to make his views known to haniyeh during the presentation of the cup. ""i told him: 'you used to be a player, please solve this problem of the players quickly.' he replied: 'i hope so, inshallah (god willing).'"" gaza's football-mad population may have to savour al shate's victorious cup campaign for a while yet as no one knows when, or even if, the next competition will take place. but for shbair, victory has sent a powerful message to his people. ""the beach camp [al shate] is very crowded, 80,000 people, and we wanted this team to make people happy after the war and the martyrs and the siege,"" he said. ""but this club is also open to all people in gaza. so it is a victory for moderation.""","5,000 palestinians turn out for a rare football tournament in gaza city."
"-- a now-retracted british study that linked autism to childhood vaccines is an ""elaborate fraud,"" according to a medical journal -- a charge the physician behind the study vigorously denies. the british medical journal bmj, which published the results of its investigation, concluded dr. andrew wakefield misrepresented or altered the medical histories of all 12 of the patients whose cases formed the basis of the 1998 study -- and that there was ""no doubt"" wakefield was responsible. the journalist who wrote the bmj articles said thursday he believes wakefield should face criminal charges. however, wakefield said his work has been ""grossly distorted."" speaking on cnn's ""anderson cooper 360,"" he said wednesday he is the target of ""a ruthless, pragmatic attempt to crush any attempt to investigate valid vaccine safety concerns."" the medical publication says the study has done long-lasting damage to public health. read autism coverage on ""the chart"" blog. ""it's one thing to have a bad study, a study full of error, and for the authors then to admit that they made errors,"" fiona godlee, bmj's editor-in-chief, told cnn. ""but in this case, we have a very different picture of what seems to be a deliberate attempt to create an impression that there was a link by falsifying the data."" britain stripped wakefield of his medical license in may. what causes autism? ""meanwhile, the damage to public health continues, fueled by unbalanced media reporting and an ineffective response from government, researchers, journals and the medical profession,"" bmj states in an editorial accompanying the work. wakefield dismissed brian deer, the writer of the british medical journal articles, as ""a hit man who has been brought in to take me down"" by pharmaceutical interests. deer has signed a disclosure form stating that he has no financial interest in the business. on cnn's ""american morning"" thursday, deer did not deny he was paid by the bmj. ""i was commissioned by bmj to write the piece,"" he said. ""that's what journalists do."" he said he is also paid by the sunday times of london, where he has been employed since the early 1980s. ""i was being paid as a journalist,"" he told cnn's kiran chetry. ""like you are. you're being paid to do your job."" ""the point you have to remember about all this, firstly, it's not me saying this. it's the editors of the bmj,"" deer said. ""... secondly, this material has been published in the united kingdom in extraordinary detail. if it is true that andrew wakefield is not guilty as charged, he has the remedy of bringing a libel action against myself, the sunday times of london, against the medical journal here, and he would be the richest man in america."" he said wakefield's remarks amount to a smear campaign against him, noting that wakefield has previously sued him and lost. the autism assignment was a ""routine assignment"" given to him in 2003, he said, adding that he expected it to be finished in a week or two. however, ""when you're a journalist and you see that somebody you're dealing with is lying to you,"" it must be pursued, he said. wakefield, he said, is attempting to ""cloud the picture... some people say he's a liar and he says i'm a liar. what he's basically trying to do is split the difference."" allegations that he is in collusion with the pharmaceutical industry are ""another one of andrew wakefield's concoctions,"" deer said. ""he knows it's not true."" asked whether he thinks wakefield should face criminal charges, deer said, ""i personally do."" in addition, he said the department of homeland security should take a close look at wakefield's visa application and how he got into the united states, ""how he's been able to export his mischief."" wendy fournier, president of the national autism association, defended wakefield in a cnn interview. ""i cannot imagine for a second that dr. wakefield would have any reason to falsify data,"" she said. ""he's a man of integrity and honesty and truly wants to find the answers for millions of children who have been affected by autism."" fournier accused pharmaceutical companies of trying to protect their turf. ""you can't question vaccines without being destroyed,"" she said. ""there's too much money at stake here."" j.b. handley, the father of an 8-year-old with autism and a co-founder of generation rescue -- a group that believes there's a connection between autism and vaccinations -- also questioned the motivation behind the investigation into wakefield's work. ""children are given 36 vaccines in the u.s. by the time they reach the age of five,"" he said. ""this is an attempt to whitewash, once and for all, the notion that vaccines cause autism."" the now-discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella. vaccination rates dropped sharply in britain after its publication, falling as low as 80% by 2004. measles cases have gone up sharply in the ensuing years. in the united states, more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. more than 90% of those infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the cdc reported. ""but perhaps as important as the scare's effect on infectious disease is the energy, emotion and money that have been diverted away from efforts to understand the real causes of autism and how to help children and families who live with it,"" the bmj editorial states. wakefield has been unable to reproduce his results in the face of criticism, and other researchers have been unable to match them. most of his co-authors withdrew their names from the study in 2004 after learning he had had been paid by a law firm that intended to sue vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose. after years of controversy, the lancet, the prestigious journal that originally published the research, retracted wakefield's paper last february. actress jenny mccarthy, founder of generation rescue and whose son also has autism, declined to comment on wednesday's developments, but has previously supported wakefield. ""it is our most sincere belief that dr. wakefield and parents of children with autism around the world are being subjected to a remarkable media campaign engineered by vaccine manufacturers reporting on the retraction,"" she said after the lancet retraction. deer said wakefield ""chiseled"" the data before him, ""falsifying medical histories of children and essentially concocting a picture, which was the picture he was contracted to find by lawyers hoping to sue vaccine manufacturers and to create a vaccine scare."" according to bmj, wakefield received more than 435,000 pounds ($674,000) from the lawyers. godlee, the journal's editor-in-chief, said the study shows that of the 12 cases wakefield examined in his paper, five showed developmental problems before receiving the mmr vaccine and three never had autism. ""it's always hard to explain fraud and where it affects people to lie in science,"" godlee said. ""but it does seem a financial motive was underlying this, both in terms of payments by lawyers and through legal aid grants that he received but also through financial schemes that he hoped would benefit him through diagnostic and other tests for autism and mmr-related issues."" but wakefield told cnn that claims of a link between the mmr vaccine and autism ""came from the parents, not me,"" and that his paper had ""nothing to do with the litigation."" ""these children were seen on the basis of their clinical symptoms, for their clinical need, and they were seen by expert clinicians and their disease diagnosed by them, not by me,"" he said. dr. max wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at rainbow babies & children's hospital in cleveland, said the reporting ""represents wakefield as a person where the ends justified the means."" but he said the latest news may have little effect on those families who still blame vaccines for their children's conditions. ""unfortunately, his core group of supporters is not going to let the facts dissuade their beliefs that mmr causes autism,"" wiznitzer said. ""they need to be open-minded and examine the information as everybody else."" wakefield's defenders include david kirby, a journalist who has written extensively on autism. he told cnn that wakefield not only has denied falsifying data, he has said he had no way to do so. ""i have known him for a number of years. he does not strike me as a charlatan or a liar,"" kirby said. if the bmj allegations are true, then wakefield ""did a terrible thing"" -- but he added, ""i personally find it hard to believe that he did that."" cnn's elizabeth cohen, miriam falco and ed payne contributed to this report.",the journalist who wrote the articles says wakefield should face criminal charges

"-- here's a scary thought: there's a country where officials are suggesting that the visas of gay partners of u.s. diplomats be revoked and these individuals be put in jail -- not because the country recently outlawed same-sex relationships but to crack down on americans. in that country, the government is also curtailing the privileges traditionally granted to u.s. consulate staff, taking down protective barricades in front of the u.s. consulate and snubbing u.s. diplomatic officers. where do you suppose you'll find this anti-american backlash brewing? north korea? cuba? iran? surely, it must be a place where the citizens hate the united states. perhaps it's a political adversary with which relations have never been particularly good. nope. all this is happening in india, which has long been a good and dependable friend and ally to the united states, most recently during the war on terror. these are tense times in u.s.-india relations. and it's all because of how agents with the u.s. marshals service treated devyani khobragade when she was recently arrested and detained. the 39-year-old deputy counsel general of india was taken into custody in new york on december 12 after she dropped her daughter off at school, and she was charged with visa fraud for allegedly lying on the application that she filled out to get permission for her nanny to legally work in the united states. court documents allege that she stated on the application that she was paying the nanny the minimum wage in new york -- $9.75 per hour, when she was really only paying her what worked out to be about $3.31 per hour. even that part of the story is fuzzy. imagine someone coming into your home and calculating what you're paying a housekeeper or nanny or gardener by the hour, when you're paying them a flat rate for the day. i know friends who have live-in nannies, and those baby sitters are essentially on-call around the clock. they're probably making less than minimum wage as well, but with room and board thrown in. anyway, what happened next isn't being disputed by either side. khobragade was put in a holding cell with other female detainees and strip-searched. she eventually posted bond, and she was released. she is now staying at india's permanent mission to the united nations. the u.s. marshals service claims that a strip-search is standard operating procedure and that none of its policies were violated in this case. a spokesman says that khobragade was treated just like anyone else. that's the problem. khobragade is not just like anyone else. she is a diplomatic officer with limited immunity. she's in the united states representing a proud country filled with reserved and modest people, many of whom consider a strip-search to be, as one indian official said, ""barbaric."" this is a country that in recent years has had good relations with the united states and where we have foreign officers stationed who we expect to be treated fairly and humanely. besides, she is not a violent criminal or a terror suspect, and she doesn't appear to be a threat to public safety. if there is a labor law violation here, it would a civil crime, not a criminal offense. and if the u.s. government is going to throw the book at people who mistreat workers, i could -- as someone who writes about the immigration issue -- provide dozens of names of u.s. citizens, from farmers to soccer moms, who belong in a lineup. lying on a visa application is no small matter, but we're still not sure that is what happened given how wages are sometimes arrived at. either way, it does seem that u.s. marshals might have overreacted in this case. like other law enforcement officers, many federal agents already get what is referred to as cultural sensitivity training. but, it turns out, what they really need is a crash course in international relations 101. the indian government is incensed, and it has a right to be. there are questions about the procedure that agents followed in this case, and they need to be answered. those policies need to be reviewed. indian officials also want an apology, and they should get one. secretary of state john kerry should deliver it himself, going beyond what the state department said in a statement is kerry's ""regret"" over the incident. questions of khobragade's guilt or innocence can wait for another day. yet, decency and common sense can be dealt with now. those things tell us something went wrong in this case. it's up to the obama administration to make it right before this diplomatic crisis gets any bigger. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette.",india is retaliating against the u.s. over treatment of consular official who was strip-searched
"-- the leader of nepal's former communist rebels was named as the country's new prime minister friday. prachanda is still the supreme commander of the maoists people's liberation army. pushpa kamal dahal, also known as prachanda, was elected four months after elections in which his communist party of nepal (maoist) became the largest party in the 601-member constituent assembly. prachanda received 464 votes of the 577 votes cast, while his rival sher bahadur deuba of the nepali congress party received 113 votes. most of the parties in the assembly voted for the maoist candidate. a simple majority was enough to be elected the prime minister. prachanda's victory became certain on thursday when the third and fourth biggest parties in nepal's assembly decided to back him. he will now lead a coalition government, although talks are ongoing on about the allocation of ministerial portfolios. the maoists signed a peace deal with the government in november 2006, joined an interim parliament and government in 2007 and fought multi-party elections in april this year. the communist party of nepal unexpectedly became the largest party in the elections, winning 220 of the 575 elected seats in the assembly. the assembly declared nepal a republic in may and in july elected nepal's first president, physician ram baran yadav. prachanda, 54, entered politics when he was 17 but went underground in 1981, making his first public appearance after 25 years in 2006. the maoists launched an insurgency to abolish the monarchy in 1996 and the ten-year conflict claimed more than 13,000 lives. according to the peace deal agreed in 2008, the estimated 19,602 maoist combatants would be integrated into the country's security structure, the process of which is yet to be worked out. prachanda remains the supreme commander of the maoists people's liberation army. besides completing the peace process, the new government has to face many challenges including inflation, lawlessness, impunity and ethnic aspirations.","prachanda, communist party of nepal chairman, won 464 out of 577 votes"

"-- when clinging to life at sea, even a non-believer might be moved to pray for salvation. imagine their surprise then, when on the horizon they see not only a rescue vessel inspired by pope francis, but hollywood star angelina jolie. the glamorous actress was the unlikely guest at a naval base in malta recently, meeting syrian refugees who had survived deadly boat journeys to europe. among them were a couple from damascus whose three children had died during the crossing, and a doctor from aleppo whose wife and three-year-old daughter drowned. ""we have to understand what drives people to take the fearful step of risking their children's lives on crowded, unsafe vessels,"" said jolie, the special envoy of the united nations high commissioner for refugees. ""it is the overwhelming desire to find refuge."" as conflict rages in the middle east, over 130,000 people have arrived in europe by sea so far this year -- 2,500 of these dying while attempting to cross the mediterranean, according to the united nations refugee agency. jolie is not alone in her mission to save them. a wealthy philanthropist couple has backed her campaign, saying: ""the world needs to wake up to the scale of this crisis."" now they've put their money where their mouths are, launching a state-of-the-art rescue vessel -- inspired by the leader of the vatican. sea savior introducing the ""phoenix,"" a 40-meter converted fishing trawler owned by chris and regina catrambone; a couple describing themselves as ""social entrepreneurs,"" who make their money by running an insurance, emergency assistance, and intelligence company. digging deep into their own pockets, they are spending $445,000 each month on the ship's operating costs. the boat has so far helped over 2,000 migrants crossing the mediterranean from north african shores -- believed to be the first privately-funded vessel ever to do so. it follows the pope's visit to the small island of lampedusa -- where 366 migrants died in shipwreck last year -- where he criticized the ""global indifference"" to the refugee crisis. just a few weeks ago another migrant boat sank carrying 500 people near malta, in one of the worst wrecks in the region. ""the words of the pope, appealing to people to help with their skills, their ability, their free time -- we had to do something,"" said regina catrambone, originally from italy and now living in malta with her american husband and daughter. ""when you see in the face of a seven-year-old child that they are safe on the boat -- there's no price you can put on that."" while other ships celebrate their maiden voyage with a bottle of champagne, this hefty 483-ton boat was launched with holy water sprinkled by a priest. ""we are normal people that are wealthy, but we are far from millionaires,"" said regina, adding that the family choose to invest their money in human life, rather than making a profit. ""it's a lot of time, and a lot of energy. but our belief and our faith is the big push."" reality check the biggest wake-up call for the couple -- both in their 30s -- came while holidaying on board a luxury yacht in the mediterranean last summer. ""i saw a winter jacket in the water, and i said to the captain, who is also a retired coast guard of malta: 'look isn't it strange,'"" said regina. ""and his face became very sad, and he told me: 'the person who was wearing this jacket is not with us anymore.'"" the comment struck regina like a lightning bolt --""it was like 'boom!'"" she said. ""here we were in this nice boat, when the migrants, people like us, are attempting to cross because there's a war in their country."" mission improbable? if sending one boat to rescue hundreds of thousands of people seems naã¯ve, the project -- called migrant offshore aid station (moas) -- comes with serious credentials. director of operations, martin xuereb, is the former chief of defense of the armed forces of malta -- the body responsible for search-and-rescue in the area. along with a crew of 16, including two paramedics, the boat is equipped with two high-tech drones, a medical clinic, 1,000 liters of water, hundreds of life jackets, and food. ""the primary aim is to prevent the loss of life, not ferry migrants,"" says the organization on its website. once at sea, the phoenix sends out drones equipped with camcorders to search for migrant boats. the moas team then reports back to the nearest authorities and awaits instructions and help. if necessary, it will offer life jackets, medical assistance, and evacuate refugees on board. captain filippo marini, spokesman for the italian coastal guard, would not comment on the merits of the maltese-based mission, saying: ''they are a resource but it's not up to us to say if it's an appropriate initiative."" the maltese government was unable to provide a comment on the moas mission, despite numerous requests. after recently rescuing nearly 250 people -- including nearly 50 children -- from a leaking wooden boat, the phoenix later transferred the migrants to an italian navy ship, where they were taken to italy and processed by authorities, they said in a statement ""they were syrians and palestinians,"" said xuereb. ""and talking to these people, one realizes they are fleeing from desperate times,"" he said.

"-- wouldn't moving objects with your mind be fun? but the implications go deeper: for the millions of americans who live with paralysis, mentally controlling artificial limbs and mobility devices would be a big step forward toward more independent living. melody moore jackson, director of the brainlab at the georgia institute of technology, is trying to make that happen. jackson started this lab in 1998 to look at methods of brain control that didn't involve surgery. at that time, she estimates, there were about five labs working on the same topic of brain-computer interfaces. now there are about 300. the brainlab was one of the first to demonstrate that a person can control a robotic arm and a wheelchair with brain signals, jackson said. ""we can literally influence the wiring of the brain, rewiring the brain, so to speak, to allow them to make new neural connections, and hopefully to restore movement to a paralyzed arm,"" jackson said. about 6 million americans live with paralysis, according to the christopher & dana reeve foundation. a smaller subset in need of such technologies consists of patients with locked-in syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. these patients feel, think, and understand language, but cannot move or speak -- they are ""prisoners in their own bodies,"" jackson explained. a famous example is jean-dominique bauby, who became locked-in after a stroke, and wrote the memoir ""the diving bell and the butterfly"" by blinking to indicate individual letters. jackson wants to open up possibilities for people with locked-in syndrome to communicate and move. there has been a lot of activity in brain-computer interfaces to help such people. another pioneering research group in this area is the laboratory of miguel nicolelis at duke university center for neuroengineering. nicolelis and colleagues have shown that a rhesus monkey in north carolina could, using only its brain, control the walking patterns of a robot in japan. in 2011, they got a monkey to move a virtual arm and feel sensations from it. this team is leading the walk again project, an international consortium of research centers dedicated to creating brain-computer interfaces to restore movement. one technique that jackson and colleagues use to harness brain signals is called functional near-infrared spectroscopy. this involves shining a light into the brain to discern how much activity is there, and examining the corresponding oxygen level. light at a specific wavelength is beamed into the brain, and the oxygen present will absorb some of that light. this allows scientists to pick up on small differences in the blood's oxygenation. for example, scientists can place a sensor over the brocca's area, a part of the brain essential for language. this area is activated when you talk to yourself inside your head or count silently, which is called subvocal speech. scientists can use the oxygen levels associated with this to create a system of allowing a person to say ""yes"" and ""no"" just by thinking; ""no"" corresponds to no subvocal speech or nonsense syllables. the original hardware for a device that utilizes this technique was developed by hitachi, and it allows a person with locked-in syndrome to say ""yes"" or ""no,"" jackson said. but jackson wanted to make something more interesting to learn. her group created a hot-air balloon video game, where the balloon reflects the blood oxygenation level. multiple locked-in syndrome patients can compete with each other in this game. ""it's not necessarily just for fun,"" jackson said. ""we can actually say, 'well, they got 70% of the obstacles correct, they were able to jump over the mountains or get through the wind.' and so it also allows us to collect data."" in the stroke rehabilitation arena, jackson's group hopes to restore movement in people who have paralysis or partial paralysis in a limb. researchers are looking at a rehabilitation robot called an exoskeleton, a device that a person sits in to be able to move limbs that they wouldn't otherwise. the robot can detect the brain signal corresponding to a person thinking about moving an arm, and then move the arm. ""what we're trying to do is make new neural connections from the brain to the arm,"" jackson said. the lab has also developed a wheelchair that a person can drive by using brain signals, rather than moving a joystick or pressing buttons. such brain-computer interfaces require that the user wear an eeg cap to measure brain signals, but setting one up is very complicated. jackson hopes to make it accessible for anyone to use in their own home. ""you can imagine how much faster the therapy would go if you were doing it all the time,"" she said.",melody moore jackson is the director of georgia tech's brainlab
"-- horrific events, such as the massacre in aurora, can be catalysts for social and political change. sometimes it seems that they're the only catalyst; recall how drastically our policies toward terrorism changed after 9/11 despite how moribund they were before. the problem is that fear can cloud our reasoning, causing us to overreact and to overly focus on the specifics. and the key is to steer our desire for change in that time of fear. our brains aren't very good at probability and risk analysis. we tend to exaggerate spectacular, strange and rare events, and downplay ordinary, familiar and common ones. we think rare risks are more common than they are. we fear them more than probability indicates we should. there is a lot of psychological research that tries to explain this, but one of the key findings is this: people tend to base risk analysis more on stories than on data. stories engage us at a much more visceral level, especially stories that are vivid, exciting or personally involving. when it's not 'only a movie' if a friend tells you about getting mugged in a foreign country, that story is more likely to affect how safe you feel traveling to that country than reading a page of abstract crime statistics will. novelty plus dread plus a good story equals overreaction. and who are the major storytellers these days? television and the internet. so when news programs and sites endlessly repeat the story from aurora, with interviews with those in the theater, interviews with the families and commentary by anyone who has a point to make, we start to think this is something to fear, rather than a rare event that almost never happens and isn't worth worrying about. in other words, reading five stories about the same event feels somewhat like five separate events, and that skews our perceptions. we see the effects of this all the time. it's strangers by whom we fear being murdered, kidnapped, raped and assaulted, when it's far more likely that any perpetrator of such offenses is a relative or a friend. we worry about airplane crashes and rampaging shooters instead of automobile crashes and domestic violence -- both of which are far more common and far, far more deadly. our greatest recent overreaction to a rare event was our response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. i remember then-attorney general john ashcroft giving a speech in minnesota -- where i live -- in 2003 in which he claimed that the fact there were no new terrorist attacks since 9/11 was proof that his policies were working. i remember thinking: ""there were no terrorist attacks in the two years preceding 9/11, and you didn't have any policies. what does that prove?"" what it proves is that terrorist attacks are very rare, and perhaps our national response wasn't worth the enormous expense, loss of liberty, attacks on our constitution and damage to our credibility on the world stage. still, overreacting was the natural thing for us to do. yes, it was security theater and not real security, but it made many of us feel safer. the rarity of events such as the aurora massacre doesn't mean we should ignore any lessons it might teach us. because people overreact to rare events, they're useful catalysts for social introspection and policy change. the key here is to focus not on the details of the particular event but on the broader issues common to all similar events. opinion: average americans don't need assault weapons installing metal detectors at movie theaters doesn't make sense -- there's no reason to think the next crazy gunman will choose a movie theater as his venue, and how effectively would a metal detector deter a lone gunman anyway? -- but understanding the reasons why the united states has so many gun deaths compared with other countries does. the particular motivations of alleged killer james holmes aren't relevant -- the next gunman will have different motivations -- but the general state of mental health care in the united states is. even with this, the most important lesson of the aurora massacre is how rare these events actually are. our brains are primed to believe that movie theaters are more dangerous than they used to be, but they're not. the riskiest part of the evening is still the car ride to and from the movie theater, and even that's very safe. but wear a seat belt all the same. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of bruce schneier","bruce schneier: when horrific events happen, we look for lessons"
"her paintings may sell for thousands of dollars, but she is best known for a modeling shot 50 years ago that helped launch a money-spinning business empire. now 72, but looking a decade younger, babette beatty was the first sports illustrated swimsuit issue cover star. discovered on a beach in florida, these days she resides in a mountain town far from the glamor and glitz of the entertainment industry that has made household names of her successors. it all started on a whim -- for her a chance of some mexican sunshine; for sports illustrated a chance, for one week, to fill the void left by a lack of content in the winter months. today, the swimsuit issue, launched half a century ago on january 20, has outgrown the magazine that first spawned it. the 2012 edition generated more than $40 million in advertising revenue, 7% of the weekly publication's total for the entire year, not to mention the millions it makes in sales to the public. that issue had 34.5 million video views online, while a free mobile app had 500,000 downloads in the opening week alone. so it's a very happy 50th birthday indeed for owner time inc. the swimsuit issue is more than just scantily-clad women in bikinis gallivanting around the world's most picturesque beaches -- it's a business behemoth. supermodels such as christine brinkley, elle macpherson, tyra banks and heidi klum have featured on the cover, while sports stars including maria sharapova and danica patrick have featured along with pop star beyonce knowles. but leading the way was an aspiring young german, then living in new york after spending several years in brazil. known at the time as babette march, she had featured on the paris catwalks and been a regular on the pages of vogue and elle. in november 1963 she received a call from j. frederick smith, a renowned glamor photographer with whom she had worked regularly. ""there were about five or six photographers who seemed to like me, and that's how things started for me really -- he was one of them,"" she told cnn. ""we did a lot of pictures together and he worked for sports illustrated on and off. he asked if i wanted to come on a trip to mexico and i thought, 'why not?' "" it wasn't the money -- as little as $50 a day for the 10-day shoot -- that persuaded her, rather the lure of a trip to the sun-drenched island resort of cozumel. ""it was a great trip -- so much fun,"" she recalls. ""there weren't any people there, not like now. you have to remember cancun (on the mainland) didn't really exist then, the only people there were the mexican air force. and they seemed to enjoy the shoot! ""there was nothing about it being a cover shoot, it was just a shoot, something fun and something different. ""each day, we'd have breakfast and then the photographer would tell as where to go. he was just constantly snapping pictures. i was put in my bathing suit, and that was it."" when she and the rest of the team boarded the plane back to the united states, their high spirits were shattered soon after touching down in dallas, texas. ""when we landed, we were grounded and it was announced that president john f. kennedy had been shot dead,"" beatty says. ""the whole plan was just crushed. people were screaming and crying, it was awful. i'll never forget that. the dream trip had ended on such a terribly sad note."" beatty quickly moved on to her next job -- she continued modeling until 1979 -- and gave very little thought to sports illustrated, as did they to her. ""that was the only time i ever worked for them,"" she says. ""i never heard from them again. ""of course i had no idea i'd be on the cover of the first issue (which was merely a short supplement to the magazine) and of course i had no idea it would become as big as it did."" but she made the cover: her head turned to the side, smiling cheekily in a white bikini as the mexican waters lapped against her ankles. even now, people still send her copies of the magazine asking for an autograph. ""there are marriage proposals too,"" says the married beatty, ""and i'm 72, i tell you!"" it's perhaps apt that her modeling career should have begun with her wearing a white bikini. as a 15-year-old, she went to the beach in fort lauderdale, where she lived with her family at the time, wearing a white, tassled outfit -- which proved to be too risque for the time. ""it was 1959 and i got asked to leave the beach because of what i was wearing,"" she says. ""but also on the beach was a photographer for eastman kodak, and he basically discovered me. my first job was outside a camera shop for $25. i still think i've got the check for it somewhere. i then started modeling properly in new york in 1961."" beatty, and her husband dale, live nowhere near the beach these days. they relocated from california to halfway, a small town of 350 people in oregon, where he works as a sculptor and she paints. art has been a big part of her life, from self-portraits to the nature landscapes and home interiors that hang from the walls of her home gallery -- which sell for $7,000 each. and when not painting, she loves nothing more than hiking with her dogs in the surrounding, undulating terrain, where it's not uncommon to see coyote, deer, antelope and elk. ""painting's always been a big part of my life and where i live is the perfect setting for inspiration,"" she says.

"-- the dock on katsurashima island off the coast of japan's miyagi prefecture has sunk by half a meter because of last year's great east japan earthquake. walking along the cracked and sandbagged quayside, oyster farmer yoshimasa koizumi spies his fishing gear that has been lying untouched for over a year. in fact the 37-year-old has never used it to fish with; he moved from tokyo to katsurashima, part of the urato islands, just one day before the devastating tsunami struck. koizumi was safe on a bridge when the huge black wall of water swept almost all before it, destroying his new fishing boat and making the house he had spent only one night in uninhabitable. he's one of thousands whose homes and livelihoods were ruined. the japanese government has estimated that around 90% of fishing boats from iwate , miyagi and fukushima prefectures were destroyed by the tsunami.

""a positive thing was that it made everyone come together. i was an outsider and many were kind to me."" the quiet life koizumi hoped for after quitting a job at a lumber company in tokyo is still to be realized, and some residents of katsurashima don't think fishing, a way of life for all on the urato islands and livelihood for most of the communities along the northeast coast of japan, is possible anymore. ""there's not much future for fishing here,"" said 75-year-old former fisherman mr. keikichi, a lifelong resident of katsurashima. however koizumi sees things differently. even though only one oyster processing factory is still functioning and a third of fishermen of the urato islands remain, he is determined to revive his new community and create a sustainable fishing industry. just a month after the tsunami, koizumi set up ""uminoko saisei"" (children of the sea), a cooperative project for fishermen from the urato islands and outside ""stakeholders."" the stakeholders' donations to help the area's recovery will eventually be repaid with fishermen's produce like oysters and seaweed. koizumi used twitter and facebook to promote the project, and since april 2011 over 14,000 people from across the world have sent donations. ""i didn't want (fishermen on the islands) to quit,"" he said. ""i wasn't a fisherman before. it's very hard to be a fisherman. if i could succeed, it could help those who quit to come back."" but koizumi's plan hasn't been without some controversy. some of his ideas have been hard for some of the established fishermen and the local fisherman's guild to digest. ""at first many local fishermen didn't have a clue what i was doing, like planning some innovative ideas and selling to new markets. it has taken time to convince them. ""before, let's just say that communication didn't happen often between islanders,"" he said, explaining that the fisherman's guild had a tight hold on how fishing was regulated and before the tsunami most fishermen operated as individuals. more than half of miyagi prefecture's fishermen are over 50, but some of the younger residents of the urato islands are happy to follow koizumi's lead. mr. yoshinori suzuki, who returned to the area from yokohama to help his father's fishing business on nearby nonoshima island, says he's open to koizumi's plans, but he currently has to work in construction as well fishing to make a living. the tsunami has actually made this a good year for the bay's oyster beds, as it brought in nutrients from the deep ocean, although this year's harvest will still be half what was produced before the tsunami. forecasts are for oyster and seaweed production to return to pre-tsunami levels by 2014, but if the bay's sea life is sure to recover, the life for those ashore is much less certain. even koizumi's project has changed from what he first thought it would be. while support from individuals and ngos has been forthcoming, the children of the sea foundation was created to help manage the project and japanese medical company tokibo became a partner. executives from the company now sit on the board, along with koizumi and members from the urato islands fisherman's guild. it's part of a wider phenomenon of companies in japan partnering or helping previously independent communities or cooperatives affected by the earthquake. ""many companies want to help the communities recover, but after two years when the local economy gets better, who knows what may happen,"" said professor masahiro yamao of hiroshima university, who has studied the economics of post-tsunami recovery plans. ""some companies may want more and more return for their investment,"" he added. ""but you can't say what is right or wrong for these communities, they are all quite different, some more isolated than others, some more damaged than others. many traditional communities will be okay without companies, so there is no one solution."" the simple life of a fisherman still eludes koizumi, administering the foundation now takes nearly all of his time. ""now there are lots of different opinions, and it makes it much more difficult,"" he said. ""i just want to be able to prepare my own boat and fish."" unfortunately that day still seems a long way off.",urato islands off coast of miyagi prefecture a microcosm of troubles affecting fishing communities
"boston (cnn)she knew something awful had happened. it was smoky and all she could hear were muffled screams. her foot was turned sideways and her legs wouldn't work right. and her good friend, krystle campbell, was just lying there on the ground. karen rand -- she's karen mcwatters now -- dragged herself across the pavement. she wanted to get closer to krystle so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos. ""i got close to her, "" she recalled. ""for some reason, i got close to her head and we put our faces together."" krystle said that her legs hurt. they were the last words she'd speak. the two women held hands until krystle's went limp. mcwatters was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev, who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the united states for policies they believe inflict suffering on muslims. three people were killed in the blasts: campbell, a 29-year-old manager for a restaurant chain; martin richard, an 8-year-old boy; and lingzi lu, a 23-year-old grad student. more than 250 others were injured. and the first day of the trial -- after opening statements -- revolved around a number of survivors of the attack, who recounted in detail the chaos of that day. prosecutors called them to the stand to paint a picture of the havoc and pain the bombings inflicted. tsarnaev's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors. mcwatters fought her emotions as she looked at a photograph that showed her and her friend of eight years lying amid a heap of dazed and broken people. their two faces, side by side, stand out among the jumble of limbs. krystle's mouth is open, but she is very pale. ""i was really scared,"" mcwatters testified, ""and i remember screaming for someone to help us. everybody was screaming, everybody was screaming for help. it seemed like a long time before help got to us, but it probably wasn't."" by the time first responders reached krystle, it was too late. ""they were doing cpr on krystle and i started to think she didn't make it,"" mcwatters said. she grabbed her friend's cell phone and tucked it in her pocket. by the time she arrived at the hospital, shock had set in. she was confused. for a while, that phone led hospital staffers to believe she was krystle campbell. when krystle's parents rushed to her bedside and saw she wasn't their daughter, they were heartbroken, mcwatters said. krystle's boyfriend recognized her and called her parents. two days later, doctors told her they were taking her leg. her body was broken, and it hurt like crazy, she said. but not as much as losing her friend. campbell's death was the first to be described in detail at tsarnaev's trial. but descriptions of the other two deaths at the marathon and the death of a police officer at the massachusetts institute of technology will come soon. there were runners conquering a 26.2-mile feat nearby, but noah's attention was elsewhere, playing with rocks and pretending to be a scientist. the 5-year-old thought it was a very cool idea to handle the rocks, his mother, rebekah gregory, told jurors. gregory recalled that she thought it lucky that noah was happy playing scientist. the next thing she remembers is being hoisted and thrown back. other witnesses used similar phrases: blown through the air, deafening explosion, cries for help. shane o'hara, the manager at marathon sports, a running store near where the bombs went off, said it sounded like a loud cannon, followed by an instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows. o'hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair. the decisions about whom to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunts him, he said. there were cries, sirens and screams, he said in answer to prosecutors' questions. he sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the courtroom. he told the jury the plea he heard: ""stay with me, stay with me."" outside, gregory tried to sit up, but could not rise much. ""my first instinct as a mother was where in the world was my baby, where was my son,"" gregory said. she couldn't see her legs, but she saw her bones lying next to her on the sidewalk, she testified. ""at that point i thought that was the day i would die,"" she said. gregory lifted her arms and her bones were sticking out of her flesh. somehow, over the cacophony, she heard noah calling for her. she wasn't imagining it. colton kilgore, who was also part of gregory's group and another of wednesday's witnesses, remembered the terrified boy looking for his mother. boston marathon bombing timeline the day's testimony was dramatic and emotional, most likely as the prosecutors wanted it. anyone who follows the news has seen footage of the bombings and read accounts of what happened. the power of the survivors' testimonies in the courtroom was in the details that made what some would call an unimaginable crime into something very real. they shared small memories, like what people said in the immediate aftermath of the attack. gregory told the jury about how she knew noah was being cared for. then she focused on the tourniquet that was being twisted on her leg by aid-givers. ""we have an amputee,"" she saw one of them mouth. what they told her aloud was something along the lines of ""this is really, really bad, but we will help you."" another survivor, sydney corcoran, testified that after the blasts -- which left her ears ringing ""just like leaving a concert"" -- she was hurt but didn't know that she was severely injured. she limped to a railing, grabbed it, and passed out, she said. eyes open again shortly afterward, she found herself on her back, with a group of men applying pressure on her thigh, trying to figure out where she was bleeding. ""i remember a man putting his forehead to my head and telling me i'd be all right,"" she said. corcoran was a senior in high school. after the one man told her she would be ok, another said he could see her eyes going white. ""i could feel my body going tingly and i was getting increasingly cold. i knew i was dying,"" she testified. in court, she was asked if she knew why she was feeling cold. ""i was dying. the blood was leaving my body. i was bleeding out,"" she answered. it felt like she was sliding into sleep. almost peaceful, corcoran said. like she was going to go to sleep and fade away. doctors saved the teen, but her life was not spared the pain of the attack. corcoran awoke in a hospital and saw her father, she testified. because she was intubated, she motioned for a pen and a paper and wrote a question for her father. was her mother alive? ""once he looked at what i'd written he started to cry,"" corcoran told jurors. the father responded: ""she's ok, but her legs are gone."" cnn's ann o'neill reported from boston. cnn's mariano castillo reported from atlanta. cnn's sonia moghe contributed to this report.","""i remember screaming for someone to help us,"" one survivor recalls"
"the mexican senate has just passed, 72-2, an 8% tax on candy, chips and other high-calorie foods. it continues to debate a special additional tax of about 8 cents per liter on sugary soda. you can understand why mexican leaders are worried about their nation's eating habits. mexicans consume more sugary soft drinks per person than any other people on earth. mexico suffers the highest incidence of diabetes among the 34 countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development. mexicans are more likely to be obese even than americans, the next runner-up. taxes on junk foods constitute just a part of a vast fiscal reform proposed by mexico's new president, enrique peña nieto. the overall plan aims to rationalize tax collections, curtail tax evasion and shift mexico away from dependence on oil revenues. that's all a topic for another day. the question for today is: will fat taxes work? there's reason for pessimism. in 2011, denmark became the first country to impose a tax on fatty foods. less than a year later, it became the first country to abolish the tax. in the words of the danish tax ministry: ""the fat tax and the extension of the chocolate tax, the so-called sugar tax, has been criticized for increasing prices for consumers, increasing companies' administrative costs and putting danish jobs at risk. at the same time it is believed that the fat tax has, to a lesser extent, contributed to danes traveling across the border to make purchases."" economists doubt that the moderate tax increases imposed in denmark or proposed for mexico will suffice to alter behavior. adjusting for inflation, soda prices have declined by nearly 40% in the last three decades, and soda consumption was already disturbingly high in 1980. to counteract such a price drop would require very large tax increases. but high soda taxes would likely encourage smuggling, tax evasion and other efforts to game the system. it might work better to pay people to eat better, rather than tax them for making unhealthy choices. britain's daily telegraph reported in 2012 on a study at northwestern university in which participants were offered cash if they ate more fruits and vegetables and exercised more. researchers were surprised to see that the participants kept up their new good habits even after the payments stopped, according the study's lead author, bonnie spring. ""we thought they'd do it while we were paying them, but the minute we stopped they'd go back to their bad habits. but they continued to maintain a large improvement in their health behaviors."" the mexican fat-tax experiment isn't bolstered by payouts of pesos. but it's probably still worth a try, and for three reasons: first, the danish failure is not dispositive. denmark is a small place with a lively tradition of cross-border shopping. from copenhagen, it is an easy 35-minute drive to malmo, sweden's third-largest city. southern denmark conveniently adjoins shopping in northern germany. mexico's population is concentrated in and around the capital city, far from any border. second, while incentives may work better than penalties in controlled experiments, it seems administratively unfeasible to operate such schemes on any large scale. it's one thing to weigh and pay 204 people, a very different thing to weigh and pay millions of them. finally mexico's obesity problem is much worse than denmark's -- and trending fast in the wrong direction. even marginal improvements are worth pursuing there. in particular, simply reducing mexican soda consumption could yield substantial benefits. when things are bad enough, policymakers have more reason to say: ""what the heck, it's worth a try."" there's one last thing that needs to be said about mexico's emerging experiment with fat taxes. when americans talk about immigration from mexico, there exists a tendency to speak of mexico as a nation of desperate poverty, a kind of somalia on the caribbean, from which people naturally wish to flee by any means possible. in fact, by any global standard, mexico is a reasonably successful country. mexico is not especially poor: gross domestic product per capita is well above the global median. within the americas, mexico is poorer than chile and argentina, but richer than brazil and oil-producing venezuela. mexico's election system is fairer, more impartial and more reliable than that of the united states. mexico is a country of free speech and free exercise of religion. it scores poorly on international rankings of social mobility. but so does the united states, and the indications are that mexicans who migrate to the united states face particularly poor opportunities here. there is one respect, however, in which mexico has historically done poorly: providing enough work for all its people. mexico's economy is slowed by a wasteful and expensive public sector and by rules biased toward monopoly and oligopoly in the private sector. mexican elites have historically preferred to address their employment problems by encouraging the discontented to migrate northward. almost one in 10 of people born in mexico now live in the united states, mostly illegally. this migration has helped mexico avoid reckoning with its domestic problems, by the simple device of transferring the people disadvantaged by those problems to another jurisdiction. very understandably, mexicans want jobs and higher wages. aware that powerful interest groups in the united states have paralyzed the enforcement of immigration laws, many ambitious mexicans have ignored u.s. law to seek those jobs and higher wages north of the border. that migration has had real costs for americans, however. and when it is suggested that those who migrated illegally be pressed to return home, immigration advocates respond with horror: how can any decent person propose such a thing? return these destitute people home to starve? but as the mexican senate acknowledges, mexicans are not fleeing starvation. just the opposite. americans should pay mexico the respect of acknowledging its success and advances -- and expect in return that mexican authorities will respect american law and cooperate in its enforcement.",david frum: mexican senate passed junk food tax and is mulling a tax on sugary soda
"amanda knox and raffaele sollecito were not in the florentine appellate court monday for the opening day of their appeal against their 2009 convictions for the 2007 murder of meredith kercher. knox and sollecito were convicted of kercher's murder in a highly divisive murder trial that, at times, pitted americans against italians who formed two camps. the ""innocentisti"" or those who supported knox's innocence were convinced the italian court was corrupt and spoon fed by a very successful public relations campaign out of seattle, washington. the ""colpevolisti"" were those who thought knox was culpable in either the murder or the perceived cover up. kercher was found semi-nude in a student apartment she shared with knox and two italian women. in an early interrogation, knox confessed to being in the house when kercher was killed, describing her screams in vivid detail. she later retracted the confession and accused perugia police of hitting her on the back of the head. giuliano mignini, the perugia prosecutor who won the original conviction and then lost the appeal also did not attend monday's hearing, but almost everyone else from the original trials was there, including patrick lumumba, the congolese bartender knox originally accused of kercher's murder. lumumba attended almost every hearing of the earlier trials and his presence underscored the complexity of the case. ""i am proof that amanda knox is a liar,"" he told cnn on monday. ""that's why i am here."" lumumba spent several weeks in jail after knox accused him of kercher's murder, and he definitively won a defamation suit against her, for which she was ordered to pay €22,000 ($29,800) for his court costs. his lawyer carlo pacelli told the court monday that knox had not yet paid that fine. there were even locals from perugia who were fixtures in the public gallery during the original trials who made the trip to florence to see the story through. amanda knox: 'i'm afraid to go back' to italy serious place the presiding judge, alessandro nencini, and the assisting judge, luciana cicerchia, oversaw the proceedings in the austere justice palace in a nondescript suburb of florence, far away from the tourist attractions like the ponte vecchio and duomo. six lay judges and two alternates -- who act more as conscientious objectors to bring the voice of the people to the judicial proceeding than as american-style jurors who have absolute voting power -- were draped in sashes with the colors of the italian flag. the presiding judge, whose deep baritone voice filled the courtroom, interrupted the lawyers when they were long-winded, and had little patience for any distractions in the court. only once, when a journalist's mobile phone rang out the rossini music used as the ""lone ranger"" theme tune -- which gave prosecutor alessandro crini a momentary case of the giggles -- did the mood lighten. the rest of the time, nencini's court was a serious place. the court is meeting to hear a new appeal by knox and sollecito, whose 2011 acquittal was overturned by italy's supreme court based on what judges said were ""shortcomings, contradictions and inconsistencies,"" writing in their final reasoning ""too many questions remain unanswered."" half of all cases in italy are altered some way during the appellate process, so knox's case is not an anomaly. francesco maresca, the lawyer representing kercher, told cnn: ""the high court ruling will be the guide the defense teams for knox and sollecito will need to follow to try to win another acquittal."" the session began with the judge reading out the facts of the case, beginning with the discovery of kercher's semi-nude body in the apartment she shared with knox in 2007, and ending with the supreme court's decision to overturn the acquittal. nencini also read the details of the rudy guede aspect of the case. guede, an ivory coast native who was convicted in a fast-track trial for his role in kercher's murder in 2008, has been definitively convicted for his role in the murder in the case, passing the first degree, appeal and high court, which is necessary for any case in italy to be considered definitive. the court ruled that he was one of three murderers, but did not name the other two. guede's sentence was reduced from 30 to 16 years on appeal meaning he will be eligible for parole in 2016. the discovery of guede's fingerprints in kercher's bedroom is what led to lumumba's release. knox concedes being 'tone-deaf' in days after roommate's murder defense requests nencini then asked for the defense teams to list their requests for the court, which included retesting some of the crucial evidence in the case, like kercher's bra clasp on which sollecito's dna was found, but which had been left for 47 days in the murder room before it was collected. the judge did not allow the retesting of the clasp. the defense teams also asked that a suspect stain, which was referred to as the ""sperm stain"" on a pillow found under kercher's body be tested. during the original trial, investigators chose to test a bloody foot print on the pillow instead of the stain because they presumed it was old stain, and most likely from kercher's boyfriend. they also wanted to take another look at what they called the lack of evidence of a clean-up by knox and sollecito. the judge again denied the requests. the judge did agree to accept three of the defense's requests. one was to retest a knife found in sollecito's apartment with knox's dna on the handle and what was found to be kercher's dna in a groove on the blade. the blade sample was too small to retest, so the results were not considered valid by the original appellate court. the new appellate judge agreed to have another stain on the knife, which had never been tested, subjected to forensic review. aviello testimony the new appellate court also ruled to accept the testimony from luciano aviello, a witness who testified in the first appeal. luciano aviello -- who served time with sollecito in jail -- had written to the court to say that his brother antonio had killed kercher and that the knife he had used was buried in a garden in perugia. he testified in court: ""my brother came in and sat on the sofa. the right arm of his jacket was ripped and he could see blood on his arm. my brother then pulled out a pocket knife and a set of keys. he was very afraid. he didn't want to create problems for me in perugia. my brother was very emotional."" he said that his brother then buried the murder weapon in a garden. aviello's brother is currently on the run, according to perugia police who tried to find him to investigate the allegations. the defense asked that luciano aviello's testimony be heard again since perugia police apparently did not investigate the mysterious claim. the new appellate judge also accepted a request to enter into evidence photos of sollecito's bitten fingernails taken the day after the murder. a lawyer for sollecito, luca maori, told cnn that the photos proved that sollecito did not have enough nail to successfully pry off the clasp of kercher's bra. ""he bit his nails,"" maori said. ""there is no way he could have unclasped the bra."" the court adjourned until friday, october 4, when aviello will testify and investigators from the ris -- italy's department of defense staff information and security -- in rome will be given the mandate to retest the knife. knox says she will not attend the trial, but sollecito is expected to attend some sessions, his father said. an appeal verdict is expected by the end of the year. opinion: what knox can and can't tell us",amanda knox and raffaele sollecito were in 2009 convicted of meredith kercher's murder
"(cnn)the islamist militant group boko haram kidnapped 40 boys and young men -- ages 10 to 23 -- from a village in the northeastern nigerian state of borno, some of those fleeing said saturday. the terrorists arrived in the village of malari carrying assault rifles and then preached to them about the group's extremist ideology before forcibly taking 40 hostages and driving toward the sambisa forest on december 31, villagers who fled to maiduguri said. it took days for information on this mass abduction to emerge due to poor communications stemming from the destruction of cell phone towers in previous boko haram attacks.this act, while horrific, is hardly unprecedented. boko haram has been blamed for numerous attacks, from assassinations of officials to bombings of crowded markets, in recent years as part of its quest to impose a strict version of sharia law across nigeria. mass kidnappings have been part of that campaign, most notably the taking of more than 200 schoolgirls from chibok in april. there was talk of a ceasefire deal that would pave the way for the girls' release, but boko haram leader abubakar shekau laughed it off, claiming that those abducted had converted to islam and been married off. boko haram leader says 200 abducted girls married off as the latest incident proves, it's not only young women who have been targeted. boko haram kidnapped at least 97 young men and boys in a deadly raid in august in and around the village of doron baga, a local leader and residents said. twenty-eight residents died, and 25 more were injured in that raid, according to residents. journalist aminu abubakar reported from kano, nigeria. cnn's greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta.","armed boko haram militants went into a village, preached, then abducted 40"

"-- a judge has concluded that 13-year-old jahi mcmath, who suffered complications after tonsil surgery, is brain dead. but it's unclear what will happen next to the california teen. an attorney representing her family told reporters they haven't decided yet whether to appeal the judge's decision, which came after a court-appointed doctor testified tuesday that jahi was brain dead. the judge has ruled that jahi will remain on life support at least until december 30. family members said they planned to spend christmas in her hospital room, opening gifts and sipping hot chocolate. earlier tuesday, children's hospital & research center oakland argued that the court should lift a restraining order that requires life support for the girl. ""because ms. mcmath is dead, practically and legally, there is no course of medical treatment to continue or discontinue; there is nothing to which the family's consent is applicable,"" the hospital wrote in court papers. standing outside the courthouse on tuesday, family members said they were hoping for a holiday miracle while jahi remains hospitalized. ""christmas is tomorrow, so it'd be great if she woke up tomorrow. ... if this was your daughter, wouldn't you want her to wake up in the next five minutes?"" said omari sealey, the girl's uncle. mother: 'i won't stop fighting' for daughter complications after tonsil surgery jahi was declared brain dead december 12, three days after tonsil surgery. the case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital should have provided better care. on monday, a judge appointed dr. paul fisher, chief of pediatric neurology at stanford children's hospital, to evaluate jahi as an independent expert. fisher testified tuesday that jahi meets the criteria for brain death. alameda superior court judge evelio grillo previously ruled that the hospital must hold off on any decisions regarding discontinuing life support until december 30 and encouraged both sides to work together. ""this is a very, very charged case. the stakes are very high. there is a young girl involved, and i think it would suit both parties well if you would speak with each other about how we are going to get through the next few days,"" grillo said. attorney: family needs to process judge's ruling attorney christopher dolan said family members need to evaluate what the judge said on tuesday before they decide on their next move. ""this involves some very serious religious beliefs about life and death,"" he said. but he said he hoped the judge's decision sends a message to hospitals everywhere: ""the parents come first."" ""what this case represents legally is that parents can say no when a hospital says, 'we're pulling the plug.' they thought that a hospital shouldn't tell them their child was going to be removed from a ventilator,"" dolan told reporters. mom vows to keep fighting mother nailah winkfield has said she'll keep fighting no matter what. ""i'm going to support her. it's my job to do it. any mother would do it,"" winkfield said in an exclusive interview with cnn's ""the lead"" on monday. ""i just want her to have more time. there are so many stories of people waking up in her situation."" doctors say people don't wake up from jahi's situation and that in her arguments, winkfield has pointed to cases in which the patient had brain activity. ""children's is currently merely preserving ms. mcmath's body from the natural post-mortem course of events. there is no legal, ethical or moral requirement that it continue to do so or that the family consent in the decision to stop doing so,"" the hospital's filing said. ""we have the deepest sympathy for jahi's mother, who wishes her daughter was alive; but the ventilator cannot reverse the brain death that has occurred and it would be wrong to give false hope that jahi will ever come back to life,"" dr. david durand, the hospital's chief of pediatrics, said in a statement monday. winkfield told cnn on monday that she'd seen recent improvements in her daughter's condition. a hospital monitor suggests her daughter is trying to breathe on her own, she said. ""they told me without your brain, you can't take your own breath,"" winkfield said. ""well, she's trying, so that means something's working."" hospital says they're investigating durand said monday that hospital officials are looking into the matter and are ""committed to learning what led to this catastrophic outcome."" ""we are sorry that jahi mcmath suffered tragic complications from her complex surgery,"" he said. ""our hearts go out to the grieving family and community about this sad situation."" in its court filing tuesday, the hospital also fought against a request by winkfield to bring in dr. paul byrne as an expert to study the case. byrne, a neonatologist and pediatrician, wrote on the website renewamerica.com that he believes ""jahi is not truly dead."" the political site pushes its view of the constitution. he is ""a crusader with an ideology-based bias,"" and is ""neither a neurologist nor a california physician,"" the hospital argued. when routine surgeries go wrong cnn's dan simon reported from oakland. cnn's catherine e. shoichet reported from atlanta. cnn's josh levs, dana bash, elizabeth chmurak and stephanie elam contributed to this report.",new: an attorney says the family hasn't decided whether to appeal
"-- bill clinton, while on the campaign trail in 1992, attacked the george h.w. bush administration for collaborating with ""the butchers of beijing."" if he won the white house, clinton promised, he would put human rights first when dealing with the people's republic of china. but six months after assuming the oval office, clinton tossed those promises out the window, and dealing with china returned to ""business as usual,"" according to william galston, a former clinton policy adviser. clinton isn't alone. candidates, once elected, usually struggle to live up to their rhetoric on foreign policy. the reason is simple, according to a cadre of international affairs experts: the view from inside the oval office is much different from the view from outside. ""it is very difficult for presidential candidates to know even a fraction of the facts and the texture of diplomatic relations between the united states and other countries,"" said galston. ""once you get inside the white house, the world looks very different."" with foreign policy about to take center stage on monday during the last presidential debate of the 2012 cycle, experts say republican challenger mitt romney should be cautious about over-promising. but some say he already has. in romney's october 8 foreign policy address, the republican candidate promised to increase sanctions on iran, help arm syrian rebels who ""share our values,"" and close the ""daylight"" between israel and the united states. robert pastor, a professor of international relations at american university and a former national security adviser to president jimmy carter, said romney joins a long line of candidates who promise too much. ""he will have to wake up if he were elected,"" pastor said. ""it would be irresponsible for him to implement"" some of those promises, and ""i suspect his new secretary of state would tell him that."" if romney wants proof of the pitfalls of foreign policy promises, all he has to do is look across the table at monday's debate at the man he is trying to unseat. during the 2008 campaign, then-candidate barack obama advocated for regional conferences with syria and iran, said his administration would enter diplomatic talks with governments that his predecessor, president george w. bush, would not, and pledged to eliminate north korea's nuclear weapons program. syria has fallen into a long civil war, iran continues to be a provocateur in the middle east, and north korea is still developing its nuclear program. possibly obama's biggest broken promise is the one to close the prison at guantanamo bay, cuba. ""i have said repeatedly that i intend to close guantanamo, and i will follow through on that,"" obama told cbs news' steve kroft in 2008. guantanamo remains open, even though obama signed an executive order to have it closed two days after he took office in 2009. the issue has largely been put on the back burner in light of issues on the economy. governing on foreign policy is more difficult than talking tough on it, galston said, because it hinges on the instability of the globe and can change in the blink of an eye. ""i think this is the reality of political campaigns,"" galston said. ""you can say things (on the campaign trail) in good faith, based on consulting with experts -- and it is rarely the case that candidates say things about foreign policy that they know not to be the case. the issue is once you get inside the white house, the world looks very different."" pastor, the former carter adviser, says these unmet foreign policy promises can be broken up into three distinct groups. there are the promises that are sincere but difficult -- or impossible -- to meet because they require action from other governments. ""secondly, there are promises that are sincere but cannot be implemented because the political opposition makes it impossible,"" pastor said. lastly, according to pastor, are promises that are made because they are political expedient but prove irresponsible once the ramifications are understood. presidential history is littered with promises that fall into these categories. during the 2000 campaign, then-texas gov. george w. bush promised to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem, a promise that many of his predecessors had also made. the embassy, however, to this day remains in tel aviv. upon assuming office in 1981, ronald reagan promised to get tough and stop the sandinistas, a left-wing nicaraguan political party that swept across central america. the sandinistas were still around when reagan left office in 1989 and to this day continue to hold political power in nicaragua. in 1960, then-sen. john f. kennedy used soaring foreign policy rhetoric to help catapult him to the white house at the young age of 43. according to the state department's office of the historian, kennedy failed to live up to his rhetoric on international affairs. ""the execution of kennedy's foreign policy did not quite live up to the stirring rhetoric of his inaugural speech. ... in fact, his foreign policy was marred by a string of failures,"" reads the state department website. in april of 1961, kennedy had only been in office for a short three months when he called for a meeting with dwight d. eisenhower, his predecessor in the office. the bay of pigs invasion, a carryover from the eisenhower administration, had been a massive failure that month and an early blunder by the kennedy presidency -- even though many attributed the failure to eisenhower. the kennedy-eisenhower relationship had been frosty, at best, after the young senator defeated the former general's vice president, richard nixon, in the 1960 campaign. even though eisenhower had long viewed kennedy as naive -- he referred to kennedy as ""little boy blue"" -- the two put their chilly relationship aside and the sitting president invited the former general to camp david to review the mistakes in cuba. according to eisenhower's notes from the meeting and a number of media reports, the conversation between the new and former president previewed the pitfalls of foreign policy campaign promises: kennedy: ""no one knows how tough this job is until he's been in it a few months."" eisenhower: ""mr. president. if you will forgive me, i think i mentioned that to you three months ago.""",candidates often struggle in office to live up to foreign policy promises
"in zambia, bicycles are grown from the ground. making the most of the southern african country's bamboo plants, two americans and two zambians have set up a company that is crafting high-end, lightweight bicycles with frames made out of the locally-grown wooden weed. dubbed zambikes, the company is putting its custom-built zambian bikes on roads around the world, offering pedal enthusiasts a unique ride while helping to empower local communities back home. ""it's a plus to have a product that is grown in africa, made in africa and exported to everywhere else in the world,"" says zambikes co-founder mwewa chikamba. ""it's rare that we have such incentives coming through -- mostly we are importing stuff from the rest of the world."" eye-catching, super light and extremely durable, bamboo bicycles have gained traction in recent years, becoming a popular alternative to traditional steel or aluminium bikes. the material, one of nature's fastest growing resources, has great shock absorbing abilities that contribute to a smooth and eco-friendly ride. ""it's a green project and we are encouraging other entities and industries to look at ways and means of bringing down the levels of pollution,"" says lusaka-born chikamba, 43. ""we produce it in a manner that is pollution-free and isn't by any chance devastating to the global warming issues."" read more: rise of the 'repats' the idea for zambikes first surfaced in 2004 when two young americans, vaughn spethmann and dustin mcbride, visited zambia on a six-week university field trip. the two college friends were impressed by the hospitality of zambians but also witnessed first-hand the economic hardship that many of the country's people were suffering. ""we noticed that unemployment was well over 60%,"" says 27-year-old spethmann. ""everybody we talked to didn't have jobs or couldn't find jobs and when we looked around nobody had decent bicycles."" spethmann and mcbride decided to return to zambia straight after their graduation. they teamed up with chikamba and fellow zambian gershom sikaala and together they set the zambikes operation in motion in july 2007. so far, the company, which employs some 40 people, has produced about 500 hand-made bamboo frames, but this year alone it expects to crank out another 450. with a price tag of around $900, the company's bamboo bikes are primarily aimed at the international market, with countries such as japan, singapore, germany, brazil, finland and the united states driving demand. but from planting the bamboo in the zambian forests to shipping the bicycles to the concrete urban jungles across the world, the process of manufacturing the bikes is far from an easy task. spethmann says the bamboo is chosen carefully for its quality and thickness. it is then cut and treated before being dried and placed in a jig. the frame is then joined with glue and wrapped in natural fibers and affixed to its conventional metal components. ""it is quite labor intensive -- each frame takes between 40 and 60 man hours to make,"" says spethmann. ""every piece of bamboo is having different colors, different bend, so every frame is unique."" read more: africa's daily commuting grind as well as their bamboo bikes, zambikes is also making steel bicycles to cater to the local market's needs for cheap transport, having so far produced about 10,000 of them. it is also producing spare parts and cargo carts as well as bicycle ambulances that are designed to easily transport patients or pregnant women from their homes to a health center. ""in rural areas where there's no roads, no fuel, nothing, these bicycle ambulances that are very low maintenance allow these people to be ferried to the clinic,"" says spethmann, noting that the company has so far, distributed over 900 ""zambulances."" running such a business in zambia, however, is not without challenges. notwithstanding difficulties such as huge transportation costs, high import rates, currency fluctuations and bureaucracy, zambikes' founders say that attracting capable staff has been hard at times. ""finding good workforce has been challenging,"" admits spethmann, ""but that's one of the reasons that we came in zambia,"" he adds. ""we saw a need and we saw people that needed opportunities, so on one hand this is a challenge but on the other hand we are happy to help."" more than just a business, the company says its mission is to save lives and develop efficient and affordable transport solutions in a country where most people live on $2 a day -- zambia ranks a gloomy 164 out of 187 on the 2011 human development index by the united nations development program. viewing social business growth as a sustainable answer to the country's economic woes, zambikes founders say the want to benefit local communities by providing employment and skills training to the ""uneducated and underprivileged."" ""the main goal we have is firstly to make the most vulnerable zambians realize that they have an equal opportunity in life to excel, to move from where they are to the next point and begin to grow into what they are meant to be,"" says chikamba. the company is also offering additional business training and interest-free loans to its staff as part of its commitment on community development.

"-- while the zintan militia leads the battle for control of tripoli's airport, another set of militia and radicalized islamist insurgents in the east are threatening a fragile libya. the increasingly unstable political and social climate in the country is indicative of a weak and ineffective government that is failing to answer internal security concerns as well as the basic aspirations of its citizens. for these reasons primarily do the zintan militia and renegade general khalifa haftar feel they have a mark to make in the security and political vacuum left by a corrupt and inept national government. while politicians in the highest echelons continue to siphon the country's oil wealth, the armed militias in response are taking over oil terminals in the east, including marsa al hariga. haftar, a libyan exile since 1987, returned to his home city of benghazi from the united states, and was frequently seen in the city's old courthouse, the headquarters of the revolution in the east. along with the former ntc chairman mustafa abdel jalil, haftar directed and advised in the crucial months of the revolution. as a retired general, many libyans are unsure of the longer-term motives and personal ambitions of a man who once attempted to overthrow moammar gadhafi. it is no small irony that haftar, like the rebel militias that are still fighting for control of strategic bases in the country, is directly contributing to the instability of the country and undermining what little authority the government possesses. from sirte to tobruk, and down to the border with chad, there is no effective government influence. while elders in benghazi want to negotiate with the islamist fundamentalists, haftar will not. his imposed policy is for these insurgents to surrender or be killed. recently, a car bomb was detonated outside haftar's house, killing and injuring many. like the brutal murder of salwa bugaighis on june 25, 2014, it is a further sign of the dangerous pitch of instability that the country has reached. ordinary libyans are now owning and bringing guns into their homes. friends in libya tell me the feeling of insecurity has permeated every household and shows no signs of abating. meanwhile, the government is continuing to fail to live up to its promises and has not provided security or jobs to ordinary citizens. at the same time, the quest for a secular society also continues, albeit whilst people purchase guns for their households and politicians steal the country's revenues. the united states, britain and europe cannot afford libya to become a failed state like somalia. the division of libya into east and west is not a viable option and is not in the long-term interests of libyans or wider regional security. this debate does however highlight the old argument that the majority of the country's oil revenues still continue to go to tripoli and surrounding areas. libya can be pulled back from the brink, but, the west must not leave libya to its own (current) inept devices. the government and the military need continued specialist training, advice and resources to fight the islamist insurgents and the disparate rebel militias across the country, and to face the new security threats coming from the south and the middle east. this process has already begun, with the united states' capture of the leader of the attack on the american embassy in benghazi in september 2012, which killed ambassador stevens. the international community also needs to put pressure on the libyan government to weed out endemic corruption. the libyan leadership need to maintain democratic credibility, unlike the last prime ministerial run that necessitated the intervention of the supreme court to rule the appointment of ahmed mitig as prime minister as illegal, to order that a new election be held, this time with a full parliament in session. the struggle to tackle armed groups in libya continues, and it simply cannot be left to one renegade general to remove islamic insurgents and keep armed militia groups in check. the views expressed in this commentary are soley those of sara elgaddart.","libya's instability is indicative of an ineffective government, says sara elgaddari"

"-- the tragic death of eric garner at the hands of the nypd -- a fatal scuffle caught in all its horror in a video shot by a bystander -- is, in part, the product of a nationally recognized police strategy, ""broken windows."" it may have outlived its usefulness in many parts of new york. garner, a father of six, was allegedly a low-level street hustler, a ""buttlegger"" illegally selling cigarettes one at a time or in packs without taxes applied. when police approached and tried to arrest garner -- something they'd done before â€” the man jumped up, complaining that he had no goods on him, had not been dealing and didn't want to be hassled. the cops swarmed garner, with at least one appearing to choke garner and press on his neck as he gasped, eight times: ""i can't breathe."" you can see the disturbing video here. he died shortly afterward. as the video went viral, community protests and vigils mounted. a central issue in the protests is the fact that the video shows one officer, daniel pantaleo grabbing garner by the neck and pressing down on his head and chest, in apparent violation of a police rule that bans such choke holds. ""members of the new york city police department will not use choke holds,"" section 203-11 of the nypd patrol guide says. ""a choke hold shall include, but is not limited to, any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air."" two of the officers involved in the incident have been assigned to desk duties with their guns taken away. nypd commissioner william bratton has promised a ""top to bottom"" retraining of every member of nypd in how to arrest people, as well as a review of the department's use-of-force policies. bratton has also met with the fbi in anticipation of a possible federal lawsuit alleging that garner's civil rights were violated. choke holds were banned 20 years ago after the death of a young man, anthony baez, who was killed in a confrontation with police after a football he was tossing with friends hit a police car. the officer who choked baez to death was ultimately sentenced to seven years in prison. bratton was recently re-appointed to the top post after a long stint in los angeles, giving the latest incident an eerie deja-vu quality. despite the ban on choke holds, new incidents continue to pile up: the nypd's civilian complaint review board received more than 1,000 complaints about the use of choke holds between 2009 and 2013, but punished only nine officers, none of them with anything more serious than a loss of vacation days. the rev. al sharpton has vowed to press the nypd and mayor bill de blasio on the investigation of the garner case, which has been turned over to the local district attorney. but the larger question remains: why was a team of six officers enforcing an almost laughably low-level crime like selling loose cigarettes for 50 cents apiece? the answer lies in new york's dramatically successful experiment with battling an out-of-control crime wave in the early 1990s, much of it built on a ""broken windows"" theory first developed by criminologists george kelling and the late james q. wilson and laid out in a famous 1982 atlantic monthly magazine article. the idea is shorthand for a phenomenon known to sociologists: leaving an otherwise safe building with an unfixed broken window signals to criminals that nobody cares about the property, which quickly becomes a haven for prostitution, drug dealing and serious crimes. with murders back then hitting more than 2,000 per year, nypd cops were told by bratton to stop waiting for the next 911 call and tasked with enforcing seemingly minor ""quality of life"" matters like public urination, panhandling and vandalism that made people feel unsafe. the strategy provided an immediate payoff. cops doing quality-of-life patrols in the subways discovered that people jumping the turnstile (entering without paying) often turned out to have drugs, guns or outstanding warrants. most turnstile-jumpers weren't dangerous felons, but it turned out that dangerous felons often didn't bother to pay the fare. so enforcing small violations helped catch truly dangerous criminals. even more important, when streets and subways began to feel safer, more people used them -- and the very presence of more law-abiding citizens always acts as a deterrent to crime (it creates more witnesses who are likely to point out the bad guys to cops or actually intervene to stop certain kinds of crimes). bratton, an architect of the broken windows revolution in policing, appears to be going back to his old playbook during his second tour as commander of the nypd: so far this year, officers have arrested 240 subway performers, who do such things as break dance and perform backflips on moving trains. but the garner case shows it may be time to revise, reduce or scrap broken windows policing, at least in some neighborhoods. when bratton became commissioner for the first time, in 1994, the city had just finished a year with 2,420 murders. the number last year was just 333. the subways aren't out of control, the break dancers aren't carrying weapons, and low-level cigarette hustlers aren't causing the kind of disorder the city weathered in the 1990s. as garner is laid to rest and the cops involved get whatever fate the court system has in store, the nypd should re-evaluate how much force and attention it needs to train on low-level crime in a much safer city.",errol louis: death of eric garner at hands of nypd shows old police strategy that doesn't work
"-- every remake is subjected to side-by-side comparisons and the criticism that comes along with them, but ""sparkle"" is something of a special case. after its release in 1976, the film became revered in some african-american households and beloved by audiences. the movie centered on the characters of sister, sparkle and delores, three harlemites in the late 1950s who find the road to stardom is not at all paved in gold. written by joel schumacher from a story conceived by howard rosenman, and directed by sam o'steen, to say it has achieved cult status isn't an understatement. the three sisters, each spirited in their own way, formed a singing group with help from two friends of theirs from the neighborhood and church choir: stix, the aspiring songwriter who also had an insatiable love for sparkle, and levi, an up-and-coming hustler. the sisters' ascent, however, has devastating ripple effects. screenwriter mara brock akil, who penned the script for the 2012 remake and is also a co-producer, believes ""sparkle"" owes its longevity to the heft of its story and the filmmakers' attention to detail. ""when you look at the original, especially in the context of when it was released and even throughout the years, the approach to these characters' stories, they took them seriously,"" brock akil said. ""they took their problems, their angst, their dreams, their hopes, their desires, their failures, seriously. they didn't have to tell jokes through it. that translates to the audience."" so when the film's director, salim akil, who is also her husband, pitched her the opportunity to revive ""sparkle's"" tale, brock akil admits she was a bit fearful of the wrath she might incur for tweaks made to the story's original characterizations. but, she added, ""it was the fear that led me to do it."" ""i think anything that makes me feel that challenge, that's exactly where i want to be,"" brock akil said. ""it did give me pause, and salim and i both were like, oh, heck no, we're not doing this. but we were driving around talking about 'what if.' ... and it was like we were already hooked and wanting to take on that challenge."" take it on they did. for starters, brock akil said, she and akil wanted to give the three sisters at the heart of the story more power. ""[salim] wanted the women to be empowered. he thought in the original that they were a little victimized. that's one of the core changes that he wanted to make, and if that was the case, then he wanted to have me write it because i'd been writing about women in my work -- our empowerment, our vulnerabilities, our humanity and all those sorts of things, and he thought i'd do a good job with that,"" brock akil said. once she moved past her initial trepidation, ""the game"" and ""girlfriends"" creator was excited by the possibilities. the story is now set in detroit in 1968, and rather than do a spin on the ""rags-to-riches"" concept the original explored, the family is now a part of a thriving black middle class. brock akil said she and her husband, who led the charge for the new vision, re-imagined the film's mother character as an entrepreneur rather than the housekeeper named effie who actress mary alice played in '76. in a role filled by the late whitney houston, the new ""sparkle's"" mother, emma, is a former r&b singer whose mistakes and trials in the music industry led her to turn away from that world and embrace the church. emma, now a dressmaker, also has the means to ""provide a certain life, an aspirational american dream life,"" brock akil said, something detroit has exemplified. ""it was hard being there knowing what a great city this was, "" brock akil added, ""a great american city that was thriving because of the car industry, because of motown. it wasn't foreign for a black person to live that. ... it was very important for us [to show that]."" although this is a period film, brock akil knew that this also needed to be a story for the modern woman. instead of simply being a singer, sparkle is now a singer/songwriter who can draw comparisons to legend smokey robinson. the third sister, delores, who in the original often gave voice to the racial injustices of the time, is now focused on a future in medicine. ""the dee character, i'm very proud of this character and the changes i've made. she got the best out of [her mother] emma,"" brock akil said. ""i think that dee is now an aspiring doctor, and music is just something fun to do."" in addition to creating more empowered female characters and setting the story in a period filled with the hope for societal changes to come, it was also important to director akil to re-cast the movie's villain, satin. played by tony king in the original, the character was a violent yet alluring high-living hustler who had no qualms about physically assaulting or verbally debasing women. portrayed by mike epps in the remake, the role of satin is now ""a bit of a commentary on how much do you sell yourself out to entertain,"" brock akil said. ""we made sure the satin character got all his riches making jokes off the black community and selling it to the white community, and he's living a really wonderful life, but inside, he's torn up, he's insecure. and that energy has to come out somewhere, and unfortunately it comes out on sister in a domestic violence way."" what of sister, the tough-talking scene-stealer who in the original had a persistent thirst for the riches in life? ""people love sister; you can't mess with sister too much,"" brock akil said with a laugh. ""i certainly tried to answer what was motivating her, and what she was trying to do."" adding in these details, she added, ""was a lot of fun for me, and i hope it translates to the audience. ""","mara brock akil wrote the script for the remake of ""sparkle"""

"(aol autos) -- do you live in one of the nation's worst cities for road rage? if you live in a major metropolitan area on either coast, chances are you do. if you live in the midwest or northwest, odds are that you don't. miami ranks as the worst city for most aggressive drivers for the second straight year in a nationwide study of driver habits followed by new york, boston, los angeles and washington. but if road rage is a ""cultural phenomenon"" as one of our experts suggests, how best do we go about combating driver frustration across the nation? traffic black spots the nation's roads are peppered with traffic black spots, junctions where car snarls elicit road rage in even the most mild-mannered drivers. southern california has the san diego (i-405) freeway, and the nation's busiest junction, where u.s. 101 meets it to the north of los angeles. miami and the east coast have i-95, which snakes from the world's busiest cruise port up to maine. the district of columbia and the beltway are infamous for gridlock. i've spent three very nervous hours getting to chicago's o'hare airport from the city center (before missing my flight). traffic by definition is worst in major metropolitan areas -- if your farming community is gridlocked, you'd better be grousing at your local council meetings -- but it is the increase in traffic that leads many to suggest it's just going to get worse. traffic levels are rising seemingly as fast as home foreclosures in los angeles and miami. in these areas, it's not only the rise in number of drivers, but the rising age of drivers. aaa points out that seniors are the fastest growing demographic in the u.s. that suggests drivers should adjust their habits accordingly. aaa has launched its lifelong safe mobility campaign to help seniors adjust to more crowded roads and perhaps more aggressive drivers. the facts and remedy when the aaa foundation for traffic safety studied more than 10,000 incidents of road rage and violent aggressive driving committed in the 1990s, it found that at least 218 people were killed and another 12,610 injured when drivers got angry. many of these aggressors are males aged 18 to 26. the aaa web site offers a three-step plan to avoid becoming the victim of aggressive driving: • the first tip is ""don't offend,"" which includes cutting off other drivers, driving slowly in the left lane, tailgating and gesturing to other drivers. • the agency then warns to ""not engage,"" which advises steering clear of trouble, not making eye contact and getting help, by calling 911, in the event of experiencing dangerous, aggressive driving. it then asks at-risk drivers to ""adjust their attitude,"" which involves ""forgetting winning"" (for the drivers to whom driving is a darwinian survival of the fittest), or putting themselves in the other drivers' shoes. • finally, they recommend that, if you think you have a road rage problem, seek professional help. other people's actions so the wife and i were looking for sofas. it was a sunday morning and, with me behind the wheel, we were dawdling around quiet streets trying to find one of those seemingly ubiquitous furniture warehouses. soon, the wife pointed one out but we were almost past it. i hit the brakes and quickly pulled in, then realized that a mercedes m-class had pulled in right behind me. a large, squat tattooed guy jumped out and started shouting, about 10 feet from my car. ""i have children in the car, i had to slam on the brakes, [how dare] you brake so quickly,"" he said, getting real mean. i appreciated i'd probably braked quickly and that it was bad driving on my part. however, as his tirade continued, i very calmly asked why he was setting such a bad example for his young children by following another driver off the road, then shouting and swearing. the man continued his harangue before climbing back into his vehicle and driving away. the next time you're fulminating in your front seat about another's aggressive driving, remember that your driving will almost inevitably elicit the same response in someone else. and don't swear in front of your kids or set a bad example for them.

""we call the back seat of the car the 'road rage nursery', where [young children] pick up all the driver's bad habits,"" james said. ""it's a cultural temper tantrum."" james said ""local norms"" can play a part. for example, florida drivers yell at each other more than in california, where verbal interplay can be interpreted as road rage in a criminal court. but, in the main, it's ""drivers trying to deal with their emotions in stressful situations."" james said that, in his studies, an awareness gap exists in aggressive drivers: when asked about drivers' habits, respondents suggested that about 85 percent of other drivers drove aggressively, while just 35 percent said they themselves drove aggressively. if you feel your blood boiling frequently behind the wheel, classes like james' are sprouting all over the nation. addressing road rage in an ideal world, an increase in drivers would automatically be met by an improvement in infrastructure, and fewer road-rage-inducing distractions. another utopian ideal is for everyone else to drive more considerately. one look at our nation's crumbling roads tells us that this fantasyland clearly doesn't exist. instead of looking outside your car at road conditions or the habits of other drivers, the answer to aggressive driving, most likely, lies within the confines of your own cabin. e-mail to a friend",traffic snarls blamed for causing much of road rage
"-- it's hard not to stand in complete awe of everything the earth has to offer when you're in the middle of yellowstone national park. its most famous geyser, old faithful, shoots up into the sky as crowds tilt their heads just to see how high it really can go. the saturated blues and greens of geothermal pools appear to be otherworldly. towering mountains wrap themselves around the park, providing shelter for wild animals to roam. but below the beauty of yellowstone, is a volcano powerful enough devastate most of the united states and change the entire world. ""yellowstone and other volcanoes around the world are called supervolcanoes and the reason is they're like a super sized drink. it means it's just big,"" says hank hessler, a geologist at yellowstone in the u.s. state of wyoming. supervolcano describes a geological phenomenon never witnessed by man. supervolcanoes are off the charts big when comparing them to a normal volcanic eruption. on may 18, 1980, mount st. helens in the northwest corner of the united states erupted. it killed 57 people and expelled one cubic kilometer of ash. the first yellowstone supervolcanic eruption 2.1 million years ago was at least 25,000 times larger than the mount st. helens eruption. two other yellowstone super eruptions 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago, though smaller than the first one, would still dwarf any normal volcanic eruption. you can monitor yellowstone activity few would expect the tranquil national park would actually be sitting on the mouth of a sleeping giant. the physical characteristic of a supervolcano isn't a typical cone-shaped mountainous peak. instead, supervolcanoes have what are called calderas. these are vast sunken areas that are formed after previous super eruptions as the ground was blown out and fell back to rest. geophysicist bob smith first called yellowstone a ""living breathing caldera"" in 1979. he now heads the yellowstone volcano observatory at the university of utah. ""yellowstone has been very important. it's my laboratory,"" says smith. he sees yellowstone as more than a supervolcano, in fact he doesn't even like that term. ""i prefer to use the term hotspot because it reflects a zone of concentrated and active volcanism."" hawaii and iceland are other examples of hot spots, but yellowstone is the only hot spot located underneath land rather than sea which has made it easier for smith to study. his team has setup a series of different sensors around the park so that they can keep a close eye on its vital signs. they measure ground movement and record the frequent earthquakes that occur in the area. the sensors have also helped smith's team figure out what they were dealing with. as little as eight kilometers below the surface is a shallow reservoir of solid rock and magma. and below the reservoir is an enormous 57,000-cubic-kilometer plume of very hot rock, the fuel behind every bubbling pool and geyser in yellowstone. with all of this heat just sitting, waiting beneath yellowstone, what exactly would it look like if it were all to blow? smith and other scientists all have scenarios and every one is bleak. in smith's book, ""windows into the earth,"" he says, ""devastation would be complete and incomprehensible."" before the super eruption, large earthquakes would likely swarm the surrounding areas until the huge blast that would erase yellowstone completely off the map. after the initial eruption, clouds of gas and rock would burn everything in its path with temperatures reaching to hundreds of degrees celsius. ashfall would cover the western united states and also enter the jet stream with the potential to cripple air transportation and threaten the world's food supply. there are some estimates that 87,000 people would die immediately. you can imagine that with this kind of catastrophe on the line, the question smith gets asked the most is, ""when is going to blow next?"" the three yellowstone super eruptions have occurred about 800,000 years apart, so people have started to speculate that another one is due. also, in 2004 smith noticed that the ground had started to rise then lowered again in 2010. it was like the supervolcano was breathing. however, smith says there is absolutely no need to panic. ""we create scenarios. we know roughly what to expect of the patterns of time and space of the earthquakes ground information. again, acquired from other experiences around the world. we use that to interpret our own data in terms of what the potential threat or risk might be,"" says smith. for him, the more immediate threat is earthquakes and smaller eruptions since the probability of one of those instances occurring is much higher. whether that may be comforting or not, millions of visitors will still make their way each year to the geological wonderland that is yellowstone national park. physicist michio kaku on supervolcano: 'all you can do is run'",underneath the natural beauty of yellowstone national park is a geological time bomb

""my theory is that you weren't ever going to tell us until we caught you,"" rep. jim jordan said in referencing an ongoing debate over who knew what when. ""when you find any evidence to support that assertion i'd be happy to see it,"" koskinen said. top irs official beats back republican barrage republican investigators have said they've discovered that lerner's hard drive was merely ""scratched"" and it might have been possible at one point to retrieve information, contradicting koskinen's previous statements. last month, he told members of the house ways and means committee that her hard drive had been recycled and the agency wasn't able to get emails that the republican leadership of the committee want to see. lerner resigned last year from her post as head of the irs division charged with looking into groups seeking tax-exempt, non-profit status. issa: back-up records of lerner's emails may exist thomas kane, deputy associate chief counsel at the irs, told the oversight committee last week that there might be backups of some of lerner's emails. on monday, the panel released testimony from another irs employee who did not rule out the possibility that some information from lerner's computer might be retrievable. democrats have accused republicans, especially ways and means chairman dave camp and oversight chairman darrell issa, of grandstanding in the midst of a witch hunt.

""we have been observing his behavior on and off the field over the last four weeks and the influence he has on the club and on the squad,"" explained van gaal's assistant andries jonker on bayern's official web site. tymoschuk must now fear for his place in the bayern team after being told he is only second-choice behind van bommel. and, since van gaal has made it clear that he wanted to choose a captain who will play every week, tymoschuk may have to spend much of his first season in bavaria sitting on the substitutes' bench. ""he cannot play in his best position in our system,"" admitted van gaal. ""that is where van bommel plays. he could play on the right, but i have chosen hamit altintop for there. every player is compared to his rivals and the coach makes the decisions."" meanwhile, bayern's french midfielder franck ribery has been declared fit to resume training after a summer spent battling tendonitis in his knee. ribery missed the pre-season audi cup tournament involving manchester united, ac milan and boca juniors and is not likely to make saturday's opening bundesliga home match against hoffenheim. but the france international, who was monday called into his country's squad for the world cup qualifier with the faroe isles in torshavn on august 12, will be ready to train on wednesday,",bayern munich confirm mark van bommel as their captain for the new season

""we do anticipate at some point in the future, there will be some criminal charges filed with regards to this incident,"" larimer county sheriff jim alderden said. the saga captured the nation's attention early thursday afternoon, after authorities reported the family's homemade helium balloon was set adrift, apparently with young falcon heene inside. since then, speculation has mounted over whether the incident was a hoax by the father, who has appeared with his family on abc's ""wife swap,"" and posted videos of storm chasing and other activities online. earlier saturday, in an impromptu press conference outside his home, heene told reporters the runaway balloon incident was ""absolutely no hoax."" the incident prompted a widespread search in northern colorado that included law enforcement from several counties, the federal aviation administration and the colorado national guard. it ended when falcon climbed down from the attic above the garage at the family's fort collins, colorado, home. if the incident was a hoax, the only charge local authorities could press would be making a false report to authorities -- a class 3 misdemeanor, alderden told reporters saturday. however, a misdemeanor ""hardly seems serious enough given the circumstances,"" the sheriff said. ""we certainly want to talk to faa officials and federal officials to see if perhaps there aren't additional federal charges that would be more appropriate in the circumstances than what we're able to do locally,"" he said. he said further details would be disclosed sunday morning, and that neither richard nor mayumi heene, who came in voluntarily saturday, was under arrest. the couple emerged saturday evening from the sheriff's office after several hours of interviews with investigators.

"-- police in santa monica, california, were searching saturday for an ""extremely dangerous"" 61-year-old man in connection with a bombing at a synagogue. authorities began their investigation thursday after the blast at chabad house. investigators initially called the explosion an accident, but on friday, they determined foul play was involved in the explosion, police said. police spokesman sgt. jay trisler told cnn on saturday that authorities were still searching for ron hirsch, 61, in connection with thursday's bombing. investigators began searching for hirsch after finding evidence at the damaged synagogue, the santa monica police said in a statement. ""investigation has determined that items found in and around the mechanism are linked to an individual by the name of ron hirsch, identified as a transient,"" a police statement said. ""hirsch is known to frequent synagogues and jewish community centers seeking charity from patrons. hirsch is considered extremely dangerous."" the explosion shattered windows at the synagogue and sent a 30-pound pipe into the roof of an adjacent house but no one was injured, cnn affiliate kabc reported. authorities do not know the motive for the bombing. hirsch also faces charges of possession of a destructive device, police said. authorities reversed their initial determination thursday that the explosion was the result of an industrial accident involving cement and other materials, santa monica police said. further investigation by bomb technicians unearthed a large portion of the cement found at the scene and uncovered materials indicating the device appeared to have been deliberately constructed, police said. santa monica is a coastal city adjacent to los angeles. cnn's rosalina nieves contributed to this report","suspect is a transient who is extremely dangerous, police say"
"-- france's far-right national front has won a nationwide election for the first time, as far-right parties across europe caused a political ""earthquake,"" with a string of victories in voting for the european parliament. the national front, led by marine le pen, notched up 24.95% of the vote in france, according to official estimates, well ahead of mainstream parties ump and the socialist party. le pen said the win showed that people want to see change in europe. france's socialist prime minister manuel valls said the result was ""more than a warning. it is a shock, an earthquake."" right-wing parties also gained ground in the uk, denmark and austria, according to projections posted on the european parliament's official elections website. voters across europe have been casting ballots for days in the parliamentary vote. there are 751 seats from 28 countries up for grabs. with most of the ballots counted, provisional results indicate that left-center and right-center parties will still hold a majority of seats in the european parliament, which plays a key role in shaping european laws and will weigh in on who the european commission's next president should be. but right-wing parties and other so-called euroskeptic groups who oppose the european union are gaining ground, said simon usherwood, an expert on european politics at the university of surrey. ""i think what's really changed is you're seeing a lot more groups on the edges, particularly with the far right, who are going to be much more of a feature of the next five years of the parliament,"" he said. so what does that mean? ""they don't have enough votes to stop legislation going through,"" usherwood told cnn, ""but what they will get, particularly on the far right, is the time for speaking in debates, the chairmanship of certain committees, which means that they're going to have much more of a platform on which they can sell their message to voters."" in france, which has 74 seats in the european parliament, the national front won 24.95% of votes, according to official estimates, coming in ahead of the center-right ump, which scored 20.8%, and president francois hollande's socialist party, which came in third with 14%. even though the vote was for a regional legislative body, the potential impact on france's national political landscape was clear on sunday. the results sparked stunned reactions from some french politicians and triumphant victory speeches from others. pm valls described the election as ""a very serious moment for france and for europe,"" noting that projections indicate that voters are skeptical of the european union. ""none of us can shirk their responsibilities,"" he said, according to a summary of his remarks posted on the french government's website. meanwhile, national front leader marine le pen said the results showed that french voters wanted more control. ""the sovereign people have proclaimed that they want to take back the reigns of their destiny into their hands. our people demand one type of politics: politics of the french, for the french, with the french. they no longer want to be directed from outside,"" she said. she said the vote shows that president francois hollande should dissolve france's parliament, where most lawmakers come from mainstream political parties. nearly 400 million europeans were eligible to vote in the parliamentary elections. turnout was just over 43%, slightly higher than it was during the last vote in 2009, parliament spokesman jaume duch said. ""the clear message here is that people are unhappy with the way mainstream political parties have handled the economic crisis, and they're giving them a good kicking,"" said petros fassoulas, chairman of the pro-europe european movement. before the election, analysts predicted that protest parties were likely to triumph at the polls. those parties are demanding tighter border controls, nationalized decision-making and a dissolution of the currency union. but they have little in common aside from a dislike of the brussels bureaucracy, so it's difficult for them to find much common ground, usherwood said. ""they can agree they don't like the eu,"" usherwood said, ""but they can't agree what they like and what the answer is."" cnn's pierre meilhan, jim bittermann, ivana kottasova, jonathan mann and bryony jones contributed to this report.","new: vote shows the french ""no longer want to be directed from the outside,"" le pen says"

""please help us, our mom is trying to kill us."" the other child he could see was wrestling a woman for the steering wheel. but the woman just kept saying, ""we're ok. we're ok. we're ok,"" as another man joined tesseneer trying to get the driver to stop. then she mashed the accelerator, turned left and shot into the cold, heavy surf of the atlantic ocean touching the shore of the florida city. it was now a battle against the pull of the water, and the second man, stacy robinson, opened a door and pulled out the two panicked children. there was a good chance if he and tesseneer hadn't been there, the children, ages 10 and 9, would have drowned inside the van as it pitched in the water, officials said. ""i have siblings their age, so it was like the big brother came out in me,"" robinson said. but there was one more child, a 3-year-old girl strapped in a car seat. a lifeguard dove in through a front window and unbuckled the child and handed her to another lifeguard. the vehicle was bobbing in water about 3 feet deep. the mother just walked away, tesseneer said, silent with a strange, almost ""possessed"" look on her face. a day later she was at a hospital in daytona beach awaiting a mental evaluation, volusia county sheriff ben johnson said. her children, including her unborn baby, were fine. no charges had been filed, johnson said, as the investigation into why she drove into the ocean was just beginning. cnn is not identifying the children or the woman, who was stopped earlier in the day after her sister called police to let them know how concerned she was for her sibling's mental state. according to a daytona beach police report, the woman was stopped by an officer, who questioned her. in the back seat the kids sat calmly with smiles. the woman told an officer that she feared for her safety and was worried her former husband would harm them. but the officer was concerned that she might have a mental illness. he asked a detective who was there to talk to her while other officers called the sister back. in the report, the officer writes of discussing the woman's behavior with the detective. they came to the same conclusion; she couldn't be held under a florida law that allows for detention of people believed to be impaired by mental illness and who possibly pose a risk of harm. they told her she could go; one officer followed her for a short time. almost two hours later, she was driving on the beach, outside the traffic lane, drawing the attention of beach patrol and bystanders like robinson and tesseneer, on vacation from north carolina. sheriff johnson said the children are now in the state's care. they had been interviewed by detectives from his agency, which was taking the lead because it has more investigators than other departments. the woman had yet to speak with detectives. johnson said his team will try to determine whether this was a criminal act or one that resulted from a medical issue. no one in his department knows how long the woman had been in town or why she was visiting from south carolina. she did have family in the area, the sheriff said. police: florida parents charged with abandoning kids had syringes in truck",witnesses scramble to help after a woman drives her minivan into atlantic ocean

"-- fifteen patients have been hospitalized in texas after getting calcium gluconate injections, according to the food and drug administration. the fda has issued a national voluntary now for all sterile-use products produced by specialty compounding llc, based in cedar park, texas. what is a compounding facility? the people hospitalized have a bacterial infection in their blood, and doctors think it might have come from the injection. a culture taken from a sample of this injection shows bacterial growth that is consistent with a rhodococcus species (pdf) of bacteria, according to the fda. ""the fda believes that use of these products would create an unacceptable risk for patients,"" said dr. janet woodcock, the fda's director for drug evaluation and research. ""giving a patient a contaminated injectable drug could result in a life-threatening infection."" compounding pharmacists customize medications to fit an individual's needs. doctors prescribe these custom medications when the manufactured drug won't work -- for example, when a dosage is too large, or a patient has an allergy to a dye or ingredient in the original product. calcium gluconate infusions are typically given to people with a calcium deficiency or high potassium levels. people with low calcium levels have an increased risk for osteoporosis and bone fractures. high potassium levels in the bloodstream can lead to cardiac arrest and death. the fda says that none of the sterile-use products from the facility should be used. the company told the fda that its products have been distributed directly to patients in every state except north carolina. they've also been sent to hospitals and doctor's offices in texas. the fda and the centers for disease control and prevention will continue to investigate just how far the potentially contaminated materials have spread. over the past year, the fda has stepped up its investigations of compounding facilities after dozens of people died and hundreds more were made sick by contaminated injections from a compounding facility in massachusetts. a bill with bipartisan support is under consideration in congress: the pharmaceutical compounding quality and accountability act would step up some of that regulation. a federal investigation (pdf) by the government accountability office, which released a report in july, found a ""lack of consensus"" about who was actually supposed to regulate these facilities and, because of that, a serious gap in oversight and inspections. before the recent deaths, the fda did not inspect the compounding facilities unless it got complaints or reports of adverse events. compounded drugs make up about 1% to 3% of the u.s. prescription drug market.",fda issues voluntary recall for all products made by specialty compounding llc
"-- hidden between tomato stalks, the mexican army found what officials describe as the largest marijuana plantation in the nation, a top military official announced thursday. gen. alfonso duarte mugica said the plantation six hours south of tijuana is 168 times larger than the soccer field in mexico city's azteca stadium. it spans for 120 hectares (about 300 acres), he said. tomatoes growing there hid marijuana plants that were up to 2.5 meters (8.2. feet) tall, duarte said. authorities detained six people this week during the operation to seize the field, which is located in the area of ensenada, baja california. the takeover means drug traffickers will not receive 1.8 billion pesos ($153 million), he said, apparently referring to an estimated sales value of the crop. duarte said 250 soldiers will destroy the drugs seized within the next week. since mexican president felipe calderon's administration began in december 2006, officials have destroyed more than 83,251 hectares (206,000 acres) of marijuana, according to a report from the country's defense department. journalist jose israel ibarra of cnnmexico.com contributed to this report.",the plantation is 168 times the size of the field in mexico city's soccer stadium

"check your facebook mail lately? didn't think so. apparently not many others did, either. so after three-plus years, the world's largest social media outlet is pulling the plug on its little-used e-mail service, the company confirmed tuesday. ""we're making this change because most people haven't been using their facebook e-mail address, and we can focus on improving our mobile messaging experience for everyone,"" facebook said in a statement. for those who do have a facebook mail account, messages will be forwarded to the primary e-mail address listed in a user's account, the company said. the changes are planned to roll out in march, and users can turn off that forwarding option if they prefer not to have their personal inboxes flooded with these messages. ""it's a little bit of bowing to the inevitable,"" said justin lafferty, editor of the trade site inside facebook. the e-mail addresses, which showed up as messages for facebook users, never took off, and when facebook tried to make them the default e-mail accounts for all users in mid-2012, ""a lot of people were unhappy with that,"" he said. ""it was kind of rolled out to everyone regardless of what they wanted,"" lafferty said. with last week's $19 billion acquisition of whatsapp, the fast-growing messaging service, facebook is focusing more on mobile messaging than e-mail these days. facebook ventured into the e-mail field in november 2010, adding the service to the messaging system already used heavily by its 1.2 billion users. ceo mark zuckerberg said at the time that the system would complement, not compete, with entrenched e-mail giants such as google, yahoo and microsoft. ""we don't expect anyone to wake up tomorrow and say, 'i'm going to shut down my yahoo account or my gmail account and switch exclusively to facebook.' but we do expect a shift to more real-time communication,"" he said. lafferty said the reversal is unlikely to be remembered in the company's annals -- much like the service itself.

"-- nelson mandela spent almost three decades in jail, but he wasn't alone -- he had two indian goddesses and a 17th century playwright for company. locked in solitary confinement on robben island, newspapers were banned and letters from loved ones a rare treat. where did he find the inspiration to continue his long struggle for freedom? as the twittersphere explodes with quotes from the legendary leader, it's perhaps easy to forget there was a time when mandela was in need of a few words of wisdom himself. he found them in the musings of another great thinker -- one born centuries before and on the other side of the world. a tattered book covered in luminous hindu deities might have seemed like a strange choice for the south african political activist languishing in his cell. but the beatifically smiling women on the cover knew something the prison wardens didn't. inside was the ""complete works of shakespeare,"" and the historic text became a source of strength for mandela and his fellow inmates during their darkest days. a bible by any other name it became known as the ""robben island bible,"" and today is one of the most remarkable artifacts from mandela's 27 years in jail. ""what resonance does a white guy from england 400 years ago have to a group of south african political prisoners in the latter half of the 20th century?"" said matthew hahn, who wrote a play based on the ""robben island bible,"" and interviewed many of the inmates who read it. ""there's this universality to shakespeare -- including many lessons on good and bad leadership -- and i think mandela found resonance in his words. he once said that 'to be taken seriously as a politician, one must always quote from shakespeare,' and a lot of his speeches when he was president did just that."" the valiant the book was smuggled into the jail by political prisoner sonny venkatrathnam, who disguised it in colorful diwali cards celebrating the hindu festival of lights, convincing the warden it was his bible. between 1975 and 1978, the volume was passed between 33 of venkatrathnam's fellow prisoners -- including mandela. many of the inmates signed and dated their names beside particularly poignant passages -- words of hardship, political unrest, or injustice. mandela chose a passage from julius caesar -- just before the roman statesman leaves for the senate on the ides of march -- and his sweeping handwriting on the now-yellowing page is a haunting reminder of the activist's dedication to his cause. it includes the lines: ""cowards die many times before their deaths/the valiant never taste of death but once."" ""i believe when nelson mandela signed this passage, he recognized this book would get out and be circulated in the liberation movement -- his would be the quote people looked to,"" said hahn. ""it was an incredibly powerful quote -- he lived his entire life according to these two lines."" lasting impression the quote is all the more poignant considering mandela's speech during the 1960s rivonia trial, where he said: ""if need be, it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die."" mandela signed the passage december 16, 1977. he never could have imagined that december 16 would later be known as ""reconciliation day"" in south africa -- a public holiday which only came into effect after the fall of apartheid. while hahn believes the ""robben island bible"" began as an attempt by venkatrathnam to gain the autographs of the most famous political activists at the time, it has now become a powerful memento of their many years -- and sources of inspiration -- behind bars. ""it was amazing to see visitors from all over the world drawn to this book like a magnet,"" said jonathan bate, professor of english literature at oxford university, who helped curate the british museum's shakespeare exhibition last year. ""it was a coming together of one of the greatest writers of humanity, and one of the greatest humans of the 20th century. with mandela's death comes a particular poignancy in a passage referring to the death of the valiant.""",nelson mandela quotes flood social media. but what inspired man himself?

"washington (cnn) -- herndon, virginia-based triple canopy has been awarded the security services contract in baghdad, a state department source told cnn tuesday. triple canopy is taking over the expiring iraq security contract of blackwater/xe, a source tells cnn. the order is effective tuesday, the source said, but triple canopy's ""in-country performance"" won't begin until may 7. triple canopy will take over the expiring contract of blackwater, which changed its name to xe last month. the state department decided in january not to renew blackwater/xe's contract when it expires in may. that followed a refusal by the iraqi government to renew the firm's operating license because of a september 2007 shooting incident in which the iraqi government says security guards -- then employed by blackwater -- fired upon and killed 17 iraqi civilians. as part of a contract to protect american diplomats and other employees around the world, the state department hired blackwater for a multiple-year assignment in iraq, renewable once a year. blackwater/xe, one of three security firms working for the united states in the country, had one of the biggest security contracts in iraq. triple canopy already has a state department contract in iraq. the new contract will increase its share of the security work there. dyncorp international also has a state department contract for work in iraq. losing the contract is considered a huge blow to blackwater/xe. while the company is privately held, the iraq contract has been estimated to make up one-third to one-half of its business. blackwater/xe has about two dozen aircraft in iraq, as well as 1,000 personnel. earlier this month, the company's founder, eric prince, resigned as head of the company. five former blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty in january to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the september 16, 2007, incident in a baghdad square. a sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents, but an iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. the iraqi government maintains 17 civilians were killed, although the indictment alleges 14 died. the company does not face any charges. but the baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many iraqis that private american security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for iraqi law or life. the indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-defense department contractors under the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act. the act was amended in 2004 to allow the justice department to prosecute such personnel providing services ""in support of the mission of the department of defense overseas."" last year, the state department renewed blackwater's contract over strong objections from the iraqi government. starting january 1, the iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain iraqi licenses to operate.","triple canopy awarded contract, state department source tells cnn"

""i want to be clear that the united states is not in the business, in egypt, of choosing winners and losers, even if we could, which, of course, we cannot,"" clinton said at the ceremony to reopen the consulate, which was closed in 1993 because of budget constraints. son of kidnapped american: dad didn't know of danger ""i have come to alexandria to reaffirm the strong support of the united states for the egyptian people and for their democratic future."" the protesters threw the tomatoes, shoes and a water bottle as the staff walked to their vans after the ceremony and riot police had to hold back the crowd. a tomato hit an egyptian official in the face. clinton's van was around the corner from the protesters, and a senior state department official said her car was not hit. the chants of ""monica"" refer to monica lewinsky, the white house intern who had an affair with clinton's husband, former president bill clinton. earlier sunday, clinton held a closed-door meeting with the head of egypt's military leadership, field marshal mohamed hussein tantawi, whose military council is in a political tug of war with new president mohamed morsy. opinion: does u.s. matter anymore in egypt and israel? egypt's military leaders took control of the government after a popular uprising toppled former president hosni mubarak in february 2011, promising to hand over control after elections. but after this year's elections, the military council issued a decree stripping the presidency of much of its power. and more than two weeks after morsy took office, the country remains in the throes of domestic political chaos. the president has no cabinet and the country has no parliament. clinton met with morsy on saturday and urged him to assert the ""full authority"" of his office. she stressed that it is up to the egyptian people to shape the country's political future, but also said the united states would work ""to support the military's return to a purely national security role."" clinton and tantawi, who met for just over an hour sunday, discussed the political transition and the military ruling council's ongoing dialogue with morsy, said a senior state department official, who described the meeting on condition of anonymity. later sunday, in meetings with representatives from civil society groups and christian leaders, clinton addressed concerns from some who have been skeptical of the united states' neutrality in egypt's political transition, another senior state department official said. ""there has been some suspicion, some assertion, and we heard some of that today, that somehow the u.s. has put its finger on the scale in favor of one side or another in this transition,"" the official said.

"-- the american civil liberties union is seeking records from more than two dozen fbi offices around the nation about the ""collection and use of race and ethnicity data in local communities,"" according to a press release issued by the civil liberties group. the aclu is concerned about fbi practices allowed by its 2008 ""fbi domestic intelligence and operations guide"" that would permit the bureau to collect information and map racial and ethnic data. the aclu press release says, ""the fbi's attempt to collect and map demographic data using race-based criteria for targeting purposes invites unconstitutional racial profiling by law enforcement."" an fbi spokesman said the bureau is not targeting any particular groups, but that each field office is instructed ""to know your domain, that means you understand your entire community."" the spokesman said that includes information about what ethnic groups are in a particular area, but it also includes things such as what particular high-tech businesses might reside in a place that could be vulnerable to espionage. the fbi spokesman said the focus on knowing the domains around each field office is an outgrowth of the september 11, 2001, terror attacks and the bureau's focus on improving intelligence gathering, analysis and dissemination. the spokesman said this needs to be done in a manner consistent with protecting civil rights and civil liberties. the aclu is filing freedom of information act requests seeking records from 29 states and the district of columbia. the organization's press release says the fbi's operations guide gives agents authority to gather information and make maps of ""so-called 'ethnic-oriented' businesses, behaviors, lifestyle characteristics and cultural traditions in communities with concentrated ethnic populations."" the fbi domestic intelligence and operations guide says agents can identify areas with concentrated ethnic populations ""if these locations will reasonably aid the analysis of potential threats and vulnerabilities."" the guide says intelligence could indicate members of a particular terrorist group are known to reside in communities with a certain ethnic population. but the guide also says it's important to know the location of ethnic groups that might be vulnerable to hate crimes in order for law enforcement to protect such communities. fbi director robert mueller spoke about the use of geospatial mapping technology -- combining software and analytical methods with geographic data -- during a november 2008 speech to the international association of chiefs of police. he said the technique is useful in fighting both national security threats and crime. ""it allows us to combine and visually map crime data from a multitude of agencies -- everything from shootings to sources, and from outstanding warrants to open investigations,"" said mueller.

"-- they've been committed to each other for eight years and have four sons together, but there's a component missing in one berkeley, california, couple's life that's out of reach for them: getting married. kristin perry and sandra stier's partnership is one that has taken center stage because of the ongoing debate on same-sex marriage in california. on monday, the spotlight will be even brighter, when a trial challenging california's proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage, begins in u. s. district court in san francisco. demonstrators are expected to be out in force. plans had been made to have a camera in the courtroom, and the proceedings distrubuted on youtube, but the ballot initiative's sponsors prevailed in their 11th-hour bid to persuade the u.s. supreme court to restrict distribution of video of the trial -- at least temporarily. the justices wrote in their terse order that they need until at least wednesday afternoon to consider the camera issue. perry and stier, along with jeffrey zarrillo and paul katami, of los angeles, are the two couples at the heart of the case, arguing that california's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional. they are asking chief judge vaughn r. walker to issue an injunction against proposition 8's enforcement. the case will likely head to the u.s. supreme court no matter what the outcome. it is expected to set legal precedents that will shape society for years to come and result in a landmark court decision that settles whether americans can marry people of the same sex. do you think prop 8 is constitutional? in legal circles and across the internet, it has been dubbed this generation's brown v. board of education, the case that led to the supreme court decision that outlawed segregation in schools. some say it could be the biggest ruling since roe v. wade, which tackled abortion. it also closely echoes the supreme court case that overturned bans on interracial marriage. the debate over proposition 8 has been fueled by emotions on both sides. for perry and stier, zarrillo and katami and their supporters, the issue is simple. they say the case boils down to nothing more than equal protection under the law and that their sexual orientation should not prevent them from getting married. ""it does not weaken the fabric of our communities to grant them these basic familial rights -- it strengthens them,"" said chad griffin, president of the american foundation for equal rights, when the lawsuit was announced in may. ""it does not undermine marriage to extend to these loving couples -- it affirms it."" ""this is one of the threshold civil rights issues of our generation,"" he said. ""justice is on our side and we're about to reclaim it."" representing them are two high-powered attorneys, ted olson and david boies. they're an unlikely pair -- former courtroom adversaries best known for being on opposing sides of the ""hanging chad"" dispute of the 2000 presidential election in florida. olson, a staunch political conservative who defended the government's positions as solicitor general, was a choice that surprised many supporters of the case for same-sex marriage. he said there's nothing inconsistent about him fighting for the rights of same-sex couples. ""they call it a teaching moment these days,"" he said. ""this gives us an opportunity to explain how wrong it has been to deny rights to individuals on that basis."" republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger and the state's democratic attorney general jerry brown are defendants in the lawsuit because of their positions in california government. however, both have said they would not defend the suit. brown filed a legal motion saying he agreed with the position advanced by olson and boies. schwarzenegger has taken no position. andrew pugno, a lawyer for an organization called protect marriage, the group that came up with proposition 8, said he believes the issue was solved when the people of california made their voices heard in the voting booth. ""seven million californians voted to preserve or restore what marriage has meant since the beginning of time,"" he said. ""if they're not permitted to do something as basic as that, then there's something, really something, wrong with our system."" for pugno and supporters on his side of the issue, keeping the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman is what makes sense. ""marriage legally and socially has always been a social public institution that affects far more than the adults involved,"" he said. ""we are taking a position that society has a very good reason for limiting marriage the way it does. ... the relationship of a man and woman bears a relationship to child-rearing that no other relationship can duplicate."" the proposition 8 vote is part of a long line of seesaw rulings, court cases, debates and protests in california over the issue. after california's legislature approved same-sex marriages, voters took to the polls in november 2008; a slim majority -- 52 percent -- approved of banning the marriages. in may 2009, california's highest court upheld the ban, but allowed about 18,000 unions performed before the ban to remain valid. for same-sex couples, especially those who did not get married before the ban, the ruling was hardly comforting. several liberal celebrity activists, led by former director and actor rob reiner, have bankrolled the first federal challenge to the voter-approved ban on gay marriage. the nation's eyes will be on the court's eventual ruling. olson and boies said they believe the case is simple based on their reading of the u.s. constitution. ""the first thing to think about is the right to marry is a fundamental right in the united states,"" olsen said. ""it's a right protected by the constitution. the supreme court has held over and over again that it may be one of the most fundamental rights to unite with the person you love to form a partnership."" for boies, the case follows a sad tradition in american history: the denial of rights to people because certain groups blindly see them as undeserving. ""this lawsuit is about the courts saying no matter how blind people may be, the constitution guarantees that everyone deserves the equal rights that every human being is entitled to,"" boies said. ""and we go to court because that is the place those equal rights have been established time and again over the last 100 years."" cnn supreme court producer bill mears contributed to this story.",trial focuses on constitutionality of ban on same-sex marriage

""it's all about kindness. it's all about my son being kind and caring about his students that makes this successful."" david heber also said his son, who was standing just a few feet away from the student who was shot, had been hit in the head with a shot pellet, but was fine and didn't seek treatment for it. nonetheless, ryan heber will be coping mentally with a difficult situation, his father said, adding his son slept little thursday night. ""this was a very upsetting incident,"" david heber said, describing his son as ""emotionally worn out."" ""it was hard for him. ... but he's come to the conclusion that he did everything he could do."" ryan heber told cnn that it wasn't just his students he was worried about as he faced the gunman -- it was also his wife, who works in the business office of the school, and his two sons, ages 5 and 3, at home. as the school went into lockdown amid the shooting, heber's wife texted him from her office, reminding him to lock his classroom door. his response, according to his father, ""the shooter is in my room."" ryan heber said the ordeal has really made him want to come home to his family. the taft shooting is the latest incident of gun violence that launched a fiery national debate over whether teachers should be armed. last month the national rifle association called on communities to arm teachers or place armed guards in schools as a solution following a newtown, connecticut, shooting spree in which a 20-year-old gunman killed seven adults and 20 children at an elementary school. ""the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" said the nra's wayne lapierre. the idea has been rejected by teacher's groups and mayors, including new york's michael bloomberg, boston's thomas menino and philadelphia's michael nutter. related: nra clarifies its stance on arming schools the debate prompted cnn commenter adika to weigh in thursday, saying, ""so let me get this straight. the nra wants to have police officers in schools ... yet an unarmed teacher talked a student into surrendering his gun. besides being one heck of a hero, that teacher just might have some advice for the nra."" another cnn commenter, frank455444, countered: ""well if the schools are armed and another nut shows up he gets shot! problem solved!"" in utah it's been legal for a dozen years for teachers to be armed in class. since the law took effect, there have been no school shootings in the state, nor accidents or incidents involving educators' firearms. immediately after the taft shooting thursday, amid the frenzy of desperate parents coming to the school to retrieve their children, parents expressed concern about school security. ""it just goes to show you that we're going to have to do a lot more to protect our students in this small town,"" an unidentified parent told kget. ""it might be a small environment, but there's always that one bad apple.""","teacher rejects the label ""hero"""

"-- as sen. john mccain prepares to promote free trade during a high-profile trip to colombia and mexico, a poll out tuesday suggests the issue may be a political hurdle as the general election campaign heats up. sen. john mccain's free trade stance could pose a problem in november, according to a new poll. according to the cnn/opinion research corporation poll, 51 percent of americans view foreign trade as a threat to the economy -- the first time in a cnn poll that a majority of americans report holding negative views on free trade. that compares with only 35 percent of americans who felt free trade posed a threat to the economy in 2000, and 48 percent who felt it was a threat in 2006. now, only four in 10 americans say free trade presents an opportunity for economic growth, a sentiment that clearly makes the issue a challenge for mccain, especially in the crucial rust belt states most affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs over the last decade. ""it's possible that john mccain's decision to highlight his free trade position may wind up losing him some votes among americans who feel threatened economically by competition from other countries,"" cnn polling director keating holland said. ""recent polls in states like pennsylvania and michigan have shown mccain well behind barack obama. calling attention to his stand on an issue like trade may be a part of the problems he apparently faces in those midwestern states."" the poll also shows that some of the key voting blocs mccain is courting are most against free trade. women, older americans and lower-income voters report feeling the biggest threat from unfettered trade. many of these voters were particularly receptive to sen. hillary clinton in key states during the democratic primary as she increasingly developed an anti-trade stance. the survey results come as mccain, who is a strong supporter of the north american free trade agreement, heads to colombia and mexico to promote the advantages off a free trade policy and economic cooperation. he made a similar trip to canada earlier this month. campaigning monday through pennsylvania -- one of the crucial political battleground states most affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs -- the presumptive republican presidential nominee acknowledged many voters disagree with him on the issue. ""i understand it's very tough. but for me to give up my advocacy of free trade would be a betrayal of trust,"" he told reporters tuesday. ""and the most precious commodity i have with the american people is that they trust me."" in another challenge for mccain, the new cnn survey indicates americans continue to rank the economy as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president. nearly six in 10 voters say the country's poor economic conditions will be extremely important -- ranking the economy as the no. 1 issue in this campaign out of 15 issues tested in the poll. that finding represents a clear change from the beginning of this year, when the war in iraq and the economy were tied as the top campaign issues. now, the economy is eight points ahead of iraq -- a fact that could pose a threat to mccain, who has admitted he is more comfortable discussing foreign policy issues than economic ones. rising gas prices are also among voters' concerns, with nearly 50 percent saying the issue will play an important role in their vote for president. that number is just behind those that say the economy and iraq are important, a clear sign that higher prices for gasoline are the primary reason for voters' economic worries, though not the only one. ""it also means that a significant number of voters are concerned about other economic woes, like the stock market or unemployment, rather than gas prices,"" holland said. ""unless there is a noticeable upturn in the country's economy between now and november, this election is likely to be dominated by economic concerns."" the poll, conducted june 26-29, surveyed 906 registered voters and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",new cnn/opinion research corp. poll released tuesday

""he has already spent too many days in detention and should not spend one more,"" vietor said. ""we urge the immediate release of mr. gross so that he can return home to his wife and family."" gross' wife, judy, attended the trial with her attorney. three u.s. officials also attended as observers. his mother has recently been diagnosed with lung cancer and their daughter is recovering from a double mastectomy. gross has been held at the high-security villa marista prison after being detained at havana's international airport in december 2009. u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters friday that gross had been ""unjustly jailed for far too long."" ""he needs to be able to leave cuba and return home,"" clinton said. ""this is a matter of great personal pain to his family and concern to the u.s. government."" his detention and subsequent sentencing have brought an apparent standstill to tentative efforts by both countries to overcome years of hostility. gross had been working for development alternatives incorporated, a maryland-based subcontractor that received a multimillion-dollar u.s. contract for democracy-building efforts on the island nation. he had repeatedly traveled to cuba using a tourist visa. ""we are profoundly disappointed by today's verdict and sentence,"" said dai president and chief executive james boomgard. ""alan gross has been accused of doing nothing more than giving peaceful people access to the internet,"" boomgard said, adding that his detention has been ""without the benefit of due process and in violation of international law."" boomgard has asked cuba ""in light of the critical medical situation confronting alan and his family"" to release gross on humanitarian grounds. last year, the topic of gross' imprisonment prompted one of the highest-level diplomatic exchanges between the two countries in recent years. during the u.n. general assembly in new york, u.s. assistant secretary of state arturo valenzuela spoke with cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez in a meeting intended to ""encourage the release"" of gross. cuba is one of a handful of places -- including iran and myanmar -- where the u.s. funds what it calls democracy-building initiatives without the host country's permission.",alan p. gross was sentenced to 15 years in prison for crimes against the cuban state

"it's about making an entrance. dramatic entries are a given with air travel, and airports should convey a sense of welcome and arrival to travelers landing in a new city, like the great train stations of yesteryear, says architecture critic paul goldberger. that doesn't usually happen. ""an inspiring grand welcome to a place is not something you get in most of them,"" says goldberger, contributor to vanity fair, winner of the pulitzer prize for his architecture criticism at the new york times and author of ""why architecture matters."" ""most only aspire to a sense of efficiency and most don't even achieve that."" where they exist at airports, the more impressive spaces are usually located in the airports' departure halls. those passengers are rushing to clear security and catch flights and don't have time to appreciate their space. the arrivals hall usually doesn't inspire much. check in: world's best airport hotels ""when you arrive, you're shunted to a lower level to baggage claim and go through what feels like a service (exit),"" says goldberger, who regularly flies through new york and new jersey's bustling but not very beautiful airports. although most airports don't meet his wish for a ""grand welcome"" -- even the ones he likes -- some architects are designing lovely airports that are worth admiring. here are some of the airport designs goldberger has appreciated or is hankering to see for himself. madrid-barajas airport (spain) the design by architect richard rogers for barajas' terminal 4, completed in 2006, is one of goldberger's favorites. ""he took what is really a conventional plan, and he did a traditional airport beautifully,"" he says. rogers' elegant architecture includes ""magnificent steel tresses and columns, and a very long concourse that gradually changes colors,"" says goldberger. ""the colors fade over the course of what must be half a mile. it's quite breathtaking."" beijing capital international airport (china) sir norman foster has been ""more successful than anyone else at rethinking the airport and designing it in a new way that pretty much works,"" says goldberger. foster's international terminal design in beijing was completed in 2008 in time for that summer's olympic games. instead of a stretched-out layout or satellite terminals, terminal 3 ""is essentially two huge triangular shapes, where the points face each other and are connected by a train,"" he says. ""that works quite well and is attractive."" 5 great get-fit retreats kansai international airport (osaka, japan) architect renzo piano's most remarkable achievement in this case may have been winning a design competition in 1988 for an airport that would sit on a man-made island that did not yet exist. located 25 miles away from osaka, japan (and three miles off the coast), kansai airport was completed in 1994 and can handle air traffic 24 hours per day. the island is now connected to the mainland by a 2.5 mile-long, two-level bridge. the airport is lovely, but ""it's more the achievement than the architecture itself,"" says goldberger. king abdulaziz international airport (jeddah, saudi arabia) completed in 1981, skidmore, owing and merrill's design of the hajj terminal in jeddah seems to capture the essence of saudi arabia's nomadic tradition. the firm developed tent-like structures using little energy to keep the space cool in the desert. pictures of the terminal impressed goldberger, which is why it's on his bucket list as an airport to visit. ""jeddah seems like a fascinating attempt to marry the nomadic tradition of desert tents with monumental modern architecture,"" says goldberger. ""a seeming impossibility, but i think they pulled it off."" world's best airport spas raleigh-durham international airport (north carolina) often overlooked as an example of good airport architecture, raleigh-durham international airport's terminal 2 was designed by fentress architects of denver and completed in 2011. inspired by its southern roots and its service to the research triangle hub of companies and universities, ""it's a terminal that has a lot of wood and glass inside, a nice alternative to steel and glass,"" says goldberger. aeropuerto de carrasco (montevideo, uruguay) seeking to modernize and expand the airport serving uruguay's capital, airport operators turned to native son and world renowned architect rafael vinoly. completed in 2009, the carrasco airport's structure seems inspired by the rolling dunes along the country's coastline. the design is intriguing to goldberger, which is why the carrasco airport is also on his list of airports to experience. ""i've wanted to see uruguay because vinoly's swooping shape looks wonderful in photographs,"" says goldberger.

(maybe if it was still open, goldberger would like flying out of john f. kennedy international airport better.) designed by eero saarinen and opened in 1962, this gorgeous terminal had a significant flaw: it wasn't built to change and grow with the growth of travel and the enormous aircraft that would soon come to idlewild airport, now jfk international. ""it was one of the great airport designs of all time, and it was completely unworkable for security and the volume of traffic (to come),"" says goldberger. ""it remains a beautiful and incredibly inspiring building."" matteo pericoli mural (john f. kennedy international airport, new york) no, this doesn't mean goldberger likes flying out of the american airlines terminal where this mural is located. italian architect and artist matteo pericoli was commissioned to paint a mural of the great architecture of the world on a wall at the american terminal. so while goldberger isn't crazy about the airport, the mural ""is one of my favorite things at any airport."" a pleasant experience matters, too when goldberger is trying to get from one city to another, sometimes his requirements for a nice airport are the same as anyone else. at the last minute, that's why he also tacked on these ""fairly ordinary terminals that are nevertheless pleasanter to be in than the norm"": san francisco international airport's newly redone terminal 2 and the jetblue airways terminal at john f. kennedy international airport in new york.

"-- somali lawmakers voted for a new president monday, a key milestone for the war-torn nation as it establishes its first stable central government in decades. parliament members picked hassan sheikh mohamud, a political newcomer who has worked for the united nations and several international organizations. the new president, who also served as a university professor, defeated the incumbent and some two dozen other candidates. the vote marks a milestone for the nation, which plunged into chaos after dictator mohamed siad barre was overthrown 21 years ago. following his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and mayhem nationwide. somalia has not had an effective central government since then and has mostly remained under a shaky transitional federal government. ""somali people have taken a great step forward on the path to peace and prosperity,"" said augustine p. mahiga, the u.n. envoy to the nation. ""today, somalia's parliamentarians â€” in a calm, dignified and contemplative mannerâ€” ended the transitional period decisively. somalia has proved the doubters wrong and sent a powerful message of progress to all of africa and indeed to the entire world."" the vote is the latest in a series of political transitions in the nation. in recent weeks, it has adopted a provisional constitution, selected members of parliament and appointed that body's speaker. ""it has not been easy getting us to this point,"" mahiga said.

"-- manchester united and their city rivals manchester city both made embarrassing exits from the european champions league on wednesday. united were beaten 2-1 in basel to leave the swiss side and benfica as the qualifiers from group c, while city beat bayern munich 2-0 at the etihad stadium but went out as napoli won 2-0 at villarreal. it left bayern and the italians to go through from group a to complete a chastening first experience of europe's top club competition for robert mancini's expensively assembled side. but it was the exit of last year's runners-up united which was the biggest upset, needing only a draw to ensure their passage to the last 16, goals from marco streller and alexander frei sent them crashing. real madrid to topple barca in 'el clasico' clash? phil jones pulled one back in the 89th minute to set up a frantic finale but they could not force the equalizer. streller's goal after nine minutes came as a result of defensive uncertainty with goalkeeper david de gea parrying out a cross which fell invitingly for the scorer. wayne rooney wasted united best chance to level and markus steinhofer belted the ball against his own crossbar in the second half before frei nipped in to head home the crucial second goal in the 84th minute. it was the first time alex ferguson's men had failed to reach the knockout stages of the champions league for six years and only the third time in 16 years.

"editor's note: kathleen kennedy townsend, the former lieutenant governor of maryland and daughter of late u.s. sen. robert f. kennedy, is a former u.s. deputy assistant attorney general and serves on the board of the brady campaign to prevent gun violence. she is a democrat. paul helmke, the former mayor of fort wayne, indiana, is a republican and president of the brady campaign. kathleen kennedy townsend says the bloody mexican drug war is being fueled by american guns. -- america's neighbor to the south is engaged in a bloody war with ruthless drug cartels. it is a war that is threatening to bring down the government of mexico, is spilling over into neighborhoods in the united states and is fast becoming a serious national security concern. american gun sellers supply the cartels with 95 to 100 percent of their guns, according to the u.s. bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives. while the mexican drug war has the media and washington abuzz, there has been little mention of our role in supplying the terrorists: we need to realize that the mexican drug cartels are arming themselves here because our gun laws have loopholes so large that criminals and gun traffickers can easily drive gun-laden trucks through them. mexican attorney general eduardo medina mora correctly called american gun laws ""absurd."" this crisis is not happening because our border is loose. it is happening because our gun laws allow guns to be sold by unlicensed sellers without background checks required by the brady bill, military-style assault weapons to be freely sold and corrupt gun dealers to thrive. we need to prevent mexican criminals and the traffickers who supply them from buying guns by changing our gun laws and strengthening u.s. law enforcement's ability to crack down on corrupt gun dealers. although it is urgent that we help stem the violence in mexico, we must realize that the same legal loopholes and corrupt gun sellers that help arm mexican criminals also arm american criminals. we should heed the call of mexican officials to help stop the violence there, but we also should heed the call of the vast majority of americans to stop the violence in their communities. proposals from washington have ignored these central points, instead focusing on border issues, enforcement of current laws and a possible federal ban on assault weapons. though helpful, those proposals do not address some other fundamental weaknesses of our gun laws. if we want to help the mexican people and our own, we must eliminate the loopholes and gaps in federal law that allow guns to be sold without brady background checks by unlicensed sellers. the atf has found that gun sales without background checks are a major source for supplying dangerous people with guns. under current federal law, only gun sales by a federally licensed gun dealer are subject to brady background checks. ""private sales"" by unlicensed sellers don't require a background check. at gun shows -- sort of like flea markets for firearms -- so-called private sellers sell guns to anyone, no questions asked, except in states that have closed this loophole under state law. texas and arizona continue to allow private sellers to sell without background checks, and gun shows in those states are one of the sources of guns recovered in mexico. mexican drug cartels are exploiting this loophole. we all agree that criminals should not be allowed to buy guns. we should also agree that all gun sellers should check to make sure they are not arming criminals. there is more we should do. we must get rid of the riders, known collectively as the tiahrt amendment, attached annually to justice department appropriations legislation since 2004. these riders weaken enforcement of our laws by prohibiting the atf from releasing gun crime gun data to law enforcement and others, prohibiting the atf from requiring gun dealer inventory audits and requiring the destruction of critical brady background check records within only 24 hours. we also should further strengthen the atf by making it easier to revoke the licenses of reckless dealers, give it the power to suspend licenses and levy civil penalties, and eliminate the bizarre restriction that limits the atf to only one spot inspection of a gun dealer per year. in addition to strengthening the atf's enforcement power, we need to attack gun trafficking at its source by limiting the high-volume gun sales that fuel trafficking from licensed dealers. under federal law, there is no limit to how many handguns or assault weapons a purchaser can buy at a time, allowing gun traffickers to quickly amass guns suitable for an army. every year, 30,000 americans are killed with guns, but all too often, washington has ignored the pleas of the vast majority of americans calling for sanity in our gun laws. politicians frequently echo the gun lobby refrain to only ""enforce the laws on the books,"" refusing to admit that there are very few laws on the books. but the mexican drug war has upped the ante. now that our weak gun laws threaten the stability of an important ally, fueling one of our nation's most ominous global security threats, the question is whether we will strengthen our gun laws to protect mexicans, and americans, or whether we will cater to the extremist gun lobby. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of kathleen kennedy townsend and paul helmke.","townsend, helmke: u.s. guns are helping fuel the mexican drug war"
"-- in short order, freed miner victor antonio segovia dispatches with some of the myths swirling around the 33 men rescued from the depths of the earth this week: he has no plans to write a book about what he endured in the san jose mine, he isn't going to sue anyone for the collapse, and he intends to go back to working in the area's mines. ""just not that one,"" segovia says. all day friday in the hardscrabble mining town of paipote, segovia's family and neighbors ready the segovia family home for his arrival from the nearby hospital. all 33 men underwent a barrage of medical testing to see how their record days of imprisonment underground had affected them mentally and physically. all but two miners were released from the hospital friday, and all the men are expected to make a full recovery. the segovia family was particularly hard hit by the collapse. two of the other trapped miners, esteban and pablo rojas, are segovia's cousins. ""welcome home victor segovia,"" one neighbor said as she carried a handwritten sign greeting the miner into his home. ""if god has given you a new life and chance, grab on to it with everything you have."" the family has received gifts. while victor's brother pedro segovia waits under the scorching sun of chile's atacama desert, he nervously toys with a brand new sony media player. an anonymous gift left for the now famous miner. pedro segovia said his brother is tough and untouched by how close he came to dying in the dark recesses of the earth. ""we missed him a lot,"" pedro segovia said. but for him its just like another shift. as if he worked for eight hours and came home. if segovia has troubling memories of his long, forced stay in the mine, so far he hasn't shared them with his brother. ""he'll tell me at some point,"" pedro segovia said. ""what happened, what he lived through."" inside the segovia house are hints of how he passed the long weeks of eternal darkness. two chilean flags decorate a wall in a courtyard behind the segovia's home. in carefully etched blue ink victor drew a miner with a drill over a 33 on the white section of the flag. below, each miner wrote his name and put his signatures in ordered columns. ""for you with all my heart,"" segovia wrote his mother blanca. the flags were a gift for her 50th wedding anniversary and were delivered by way of the ""paloma"" tube system that sent food and letters to the men. ""he likes to play the guitar, accordion and organ,"" blanca segovia said with pride about her son, who learned to play the instruments without any formal training. ""we are going to have a nice party for him."" but for the guest of honor just getting to the party will be almost as difficult as the previous legs of his journey. as the afternoon wears on, more and more media trickle into the neighborhood. tripods and cameras are posted like sentries in front of the segovia home. it has all the makings of an ugly media scene. so photographers agree and shake hands that all will stay in a fixed line so everyone can get an unobstructed shot of segovia's homecoming. but hours later as segovia steps from a van, a still photographer lurches forward and the plan is scrapped. pushing against the wave of cameramen, chilean police nearly have to carry the miner into his family's home. one of the photographers gets into a showing match with an officer after the melee. as the party gets under way, though, clapping and joyous chants of ""chi chi chi, le le le, los mineros de chile,"" can be heard from outside the house. then journalists still hanging around the house receive an invitation to come in and speak with the miner. segovia appeared understandably worn from his ordeal and the crush of media attention. as reporters ask him questions, he looks down. his voice is soft and his answers are clipped. ""that was quite something,"" he said simply of the august 5 mine collapse. ""that was something very ugly."" he said he has been to camp hope, where family members waited for the miners' rescue. ""i don't need to go back,"" he said. segovia said he missed his family terribly while in the mine. and, he said, he has become someone who ""thinks more about god."" ""we were a team,"" he said of the 33 men. ""but all the same there were problems. so much time together, like any family, the problems start but were ones we worked out."" other miners have told cnn that the 33 men swore an oath never to discuss the details of what took place as the men struggled to survive in the mine. before he goes back to the party, segovia makes it clear he is not completely free of the mine. ""down there you were always tired and didn't have any nightmares,"" he said. ""here you have nightmares until you realize you are out.""","victor segovia, two of his cousins were trapped in the san jose mine"
"(cnn)the third blood moon in a four-part series was the shortest eclipse of the bunch, but still a sweet treat for early risers in north america. the moon slipped fully into earth's shadow at 4:58 a.m. pacific time (7:58 a.m. et) saturday, starting a total lunar eclipse for nearly five minutes -- what nasa says will be the shortest such eclipse of the century. the celestial body took on a burnt-orange tint in the minutes before, during and after the total eclipse, giving the moon the appearance that earns total eclipses the ""blood moon"" nickname. watchers in the eastern half of north america caught only a partial eclipse -- and in some places, an orange one -- before the moon set below the horizon. the event started at 3:16 a.m. pt (6:16 a.m. et), when the moon began moving into earth's shadow. ""the lunar eclipse is looking good!"" tweeted ryan hoke, a meteorologist for cnn affiliate wave in louisville, kentucky, showing a picture of a reddish partial moon in a blue dawn sky. people from the u.s. west coast to australia were able to catch the total eclipse. parts of south america, india, china and russia were able to see at least parts of the event, but it wasn't visible in greenland, iceland, europe, africa or the middle east. a lunar eclipse happens when the sun, earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the earth smack in the middle. the sun shines on the earth and creates a shadow. as the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color. why red? because earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. nasa says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a ""tetrad."" the first was april 15, 2014, and the second was october 23, 2014. the space agency predicts the next one will come september 28. did you see it? share your photos with cnn ireport.",the total eclipse lasted 4 minutes and 43 seconds
"apparently working under the impression that they understand the science of sexuality better than the world health organization or the american medical or psychological or psychiatric associations, texas republicans made a bold statement last weekend. with zero debate, they adopted a party platform that includes support for a widely discredited form of mental health ""treatment"" known as ""reparative therapy."" also called ""conversion therapy,"" this dangerous pseudo-medical practice aimed at transforming homosexuals into heterosexuals has been widely demonstrated to be both ineffective and harmful, not to mention offensive. the clearly misguided assumption underlying such therapy is the belief (often reinforced by self-serving interpretations of any number of religious texts) that homosexuality is a disease. however, much like drapetomania (the pseudo-scientific ""disease"" an enterprising white man conveniently identified in the mid-19th century was described as the condition that led black slaves to attempt escape), homosexuality is in fact not an illness, but rather a fact of human nature. and rejecting human nature can have devastating effects on the psyche, demonstrating that if there is a real disease that needs fixing here, it's homophobia, not homosexuality. lesbian, gay and bisexual youth experience significantly increased risk for suicide than their heterosexual peers. in fact, as cited by the trevor project, a nonprofit organization that provides lgbt youth with crisis intervention and suicide prevention services, lgb youth are four times more likely than their heterosexual peers to attempt suicide, and their attempts are four to six times more likely to result in injuries that require medical attention. moreover, lgb youth from highly unsupportive families (like the kinds that would be drawn to conversion therapy) are more than eight times more likely to have attempted suicide as those from more accepting and supportive households. recognizing this, both new jersey and california have banned conversion therapy for minors, and other states are considering similar initiatives. by explicitly supporting such pseudo-therapy, the texas republican party has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such ""treatments"" reinforce. it has reminded us just how out of touch the texas gop can be—not only regarding modern medicine, but also with respect to the future of their own party. according to the pew research center, 61% of republicans under 30 support same-sex marriage. that's only 1 percentage point less than that of democrats over the age of 65 who support it. in short, the dinosaurs behind embarrassing and discriminatory platforms like this are guaranteeing their own extinction by clinging onto closed-minded convictions that are clearly on the way out. but there is hope. as it turns out, some of the most seemingly anti-gay individuals are in fact responding to an internalized homophobia in conflict with their own homosexuality. keeping this and the aforementioned statistics in mind, i propose that texas republicans step into the 21st century by adopting a different kind of conversion therapy—namely, one that replaces fear and bigotry with knowledge, acceptance and respect.","texas gop endorsed ""reparative therapy"" to convert gays to straight orientation"
"(ew.com) -- ben affleck's c.i.a. thriller ""argo"" is having quite the box office run. after debuting at number two with $19.5 million, warner bros.' oscar contender dropped by just 16 percent last weekend to $16.4 million. this weekend, the film notched yet another impressive achievement: it climbed to number one with an estimated $12.4 million (a 25 percent drop) in its third frame, becoming the first film since ""true grit"" to hop to first place in its third weekend. ""argo,"" which cost $45 million to make, has now earned $60.8 million total, and thanks to terrific word-of-mouth (the film earned an ""a+"" cinemascore grade) and early awards buzz, argo is eyeing a $100 million finish. though it is running a tad behind affleck's last directorial effort, the town, which had earned $64.1 million at the same point in its run en route to a $92.2 million finish, argo is enjoying much better week-to-week holds. (""the town,"" which opened higher ""argo"" with $23.8 million, fell 38 percent to $9.7 million in its third weekend.) sony pictures animation's $85 million adam sandler-voiced effort ""hotel transylvania"" jumped two spots into second place with $9.5 million in its fifth weekend. the film, which has scored slim drops since its robust $42.5 million debut in september, only fell 27 percent this weekend — the final frame before ""halloween."" it will be interesting to see whether hotel holds up in the holiday's wake, but it's already a monster hit. with $130.4 million total, hotel is already sony pictures animation's highest grossing film ever, above cloudy with a chance of meatballs, which grossed $124.9 million in 2009. it's also given adam sandler a much-needed career boost following his back-to-back misfires, jack and jill and that's my boy. the pricey novel adaptation ""cloud atlas"" finished in third place with a weak $9.4 million. remarkably, that was the best start of any of this weekend's newcomers, which is a testament to the weakness of the frame. the heady drama, which follows six separate storylines and stars tom hanks, halle berry, and hugh grant in various roles, genders, and races, proved too difficult for mainstream audiences to latch onto. audiences, which were 77 percent above the age of 25, issued the film a ""c+"" cinemascore. for warner bros., ""cloud atlas' ""failure is not the worst news — the studio acquired domestic distribution rights for a reported $15 million and marketed the film — but the real losers here are the wachowski siblings and the foreign investors who financed the project. ""cloud atlas"" cost a whopping $100 million, and it has no chance of making that money back — at least not in the states. another loser? tom hanks, whose box office clout has all but disappeared in recent years. cloud atlas arrives on the heels of two other box office underperformers: ""extremely loud and incredibly close"" ($31.9 million) and ""larry crowne"" ($35.6 million). in fourth, ""paranormal activity 4"" dropped by a massive 70 percent — a high point for the paranormal franchise (pa2 dropped by 60 percent in its second weekend. pa3 fell 65 percent) — to $8.7 million. after ten days, paramount's $5 million found footage sequel has earned $42.6 million, which is still $10 million less than pa3 grossed in its first weekend. ""taken 2"" took fifth place, sliding 40 percent to $8.0 million, which gives fox's $45 million action thriller a $117.4 million total. though the liam neeson vehicle is a huge hit, it's becoming clear that it will not surpass the final $145 million domestic gross of the original ""taken."" in its fourth weekend, ""taken,"" which opened with half of what taken 2 made, earned $11.3 million. ""taken 2"" is falling much faster. 1. argo -- $12.4 million 2. hotel transylvania -- $9.5 million 3. cloud atlas -- $9.4 million 4. paranormal activity 4 -- $8.7 million 5. taken 2 -- $8.0 million outside the top 5, three new wide releases all performed embarrassingly. open road's $20 million videogame adaptation/horror sequel ""silent hill: revelation 3d"" started in sixth place with $8.0 million. the original ""silent hill"" surprised analysts with a strong $20.2 million debut in 2006, but it clearly didn't leave enough of an impression on audiences for them to show up for a sequel six years later. crowds gave the film an uninspiring ""c"" cinemascore. two other films did even worse. paramount's surprisingly edgy victoria justice vehicle ""fun size"" grossed $4.1 million from 3,014 theaters. the $14 million film garnered a ""b"" cinemascore grade from crowds, which were 67 percent female and 61 percent below the age of 18. gerard butler's new surfing drama ""chasing mavericks,"" meanwhile, tanked in twelfth place with $2.2 million from 2,006 theaters, giving it a $1,099 per theater average. audiences issued the film a ""b+"" cinemascore. internationally, ""skyfall,"" the 23rd picture in the james bond series, got off to a massive start. the film grossed $77.7 million from 25 territories, including $32.4 million from the u.k. (where the film set a new attendance record on saturday), $9.1 million from france, and $8.6 million from russia. according to sony, skyfall's start was 76 percent bigger than the launch of casino royale, and 30 percent bigger than quantum of solace's debut. the film opens stateside on nov. 9. see original story at ew.com. click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. all rights reserved.","""argo"" is the first film since ""true grit"" to hop to first place in its third weekend."

""no question it was the big one,"" he said. asked if the united states would not have invaded if the administration hadn't believed iraq had the weapons of mass destruction, rumsfeld said: ""i think that's probably right."" he criticized the source known as ""curveball"" -- an iraqi defector who admitted his claims that iraq possessed wmds were false -- but stopped short of condemning the u.s. intelligence community. ""the intelligence community talks to hundreds of people,"" rumsfeld said. ""they have human assets, such as this man. some are honest, some are dishonest. some do it for money, some do it for self aggrandizement. some do it, apparently, to lie."" now peddling a book, four years after being replaced by robert gates as defense secretary following heavy republican losses in the 2006 mid-term elections, rumsfeld maintained the swagger and bravado that were his hallmarks when dealing with the media as a cabinet member. he said said the obama administration was ""wrong in attacking the bush administration's structures that have kept this country safe for almost a decade now,"" including the detention facility at guantanamo bay, cuba. president barack obama campaigned on the promise that he would close the facility known as gitmo in his first year in office, but it remains open. ""they now have switched from the campaign mode, and they are keeping guantanamo bay. they are keeping indefinite detention,"" rumsfeld said. ""they are keeping military commissions. so obviously, they've come to the conclusion that their campaign promises -- easier to campaign than it is to govern."" rumsfeld also rejected the premise that the united states is viewed more favorably around the world with obama as president. ""no, and i don't think there's data that supports that,"" rumsfeld said. ""i think he had made a practice of trying to apologize for america. i personally am proud of america."" he was also critical of the nobel peace prize awarded obama in his first year in office in 2009. ""well, he had not accomplished a thing when he got the nobel prize,"" rumsfeld said. ""it was given to him on hope. had to have been, because there wasn't anything that he'd done."" despite receiving some boos when he recently was honored at the conservative political action conference, the annual gathering of conservative activists, rumsfeld said the tea party movement has brought ""a lot of energy into public life and public affairs."" he said he was ""deeply worried about the budget"" and that the country needs to start saving money now. some of those savings can come in the pentagon budget he formerly oversaw, he said.

"a cameroonian soldier was killed and 10 chinese nationals went missing after a boko haram attack in northern cameroon, officials from china, the united states and france said saturday. no further details were immediately available on the circumstances of their disappearance, said lu quinjiang, first counselor of the chinese embassy in yaounde, cameroon's capital. one chinese national was injured in friday night's attack and was being treated by a chinese medical team in the chadian capital of n'djamena, lu said. french president françois hollande mentioned the incident saturday while hosting a security summit in paris about the growing threat from boko haram, the nigeria-based terror group. later, u.s. undersecretary of state wendy sherman specified boko haram as being behind friday's attack in a region of cameroon known to be a stronghold for the group. ""cameroon just suffered its own boko haram attack at a chinese company last night,"" sherman said, noting also that boko haram is to blame for the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in nigeria. several african and western nations stepped up their search for the girls under a new plan announced at the security summit. boko haram translates as ""western education is a sin"" in the hausa language that's the lingua franca in west and central africa. the militant group says its aim is to impose stricter enforcement of sharia law across nigeria, africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority muslim north and a mostly christian south. boko haram's attacks have intensified in recent years. cameroon attack friday's attack targeted employees of a chinese company in the northern cameroonian town of waza, a few miles away from the nigerian border. u.s. questions nigeria's rescue ability; france hosts summit the chinese embassy is working with cameroon's government to locate the missing workers, lu said, and has asked for tighter security to protect chinese nationals in the northern part of the country. the chinese company, sinohydro, is an engineering firm that builds large scale hydropower projects. it has been involved in the construction of the memve'ele dam in southern cameroon as part of the country's effort to boost electricity production, according to the company's website. last year, a group of boko haram fighters crossed into northern cameroon and abducted a french family of four children, their parents and an uncle from waza national park. the family was eventually released, reportedly in exchange for a $3 million ransom and the release of 16 boko haram prisoners held in cameroon.","boko haram is behind the attack in cameroon, a u.s. official says"
"-- russian investigators on saturday picked through the remains of a burned-out nightclub and detained at least five people in the aftermath of an explosive inferno, the result of an alleged misuse of fireworks that claimed more than 100 lives. friday night's fire -- in the ural mountain area industrial city of perm -- swept through a party in full swing at the lame horse, a local nightclub celebrating its eighth year in business. the blast and fire engulfed the club, law enforcement officials said, as a performance artist juggled cold-flame pyrotechnical maces. as he threw them high in the air, the club's ceiling caught fire and almost immediately spread on to the wooden walls, cutting off exits. people succumbed to smoke inhalation or were trampled attempting to escape the panicky chaos. the latest death reports varied, with one count as high as 109. around 130 people were injured, authorities said, with dozens were in critical condition and many of them hooked up to artificial lung ventilators. authorities have opened a criminal investigation. the investigative committee of the russian prosecutor's office said several people have been detained: two club co-owners, a club manager, the night club art director, and a businessman who provided the fireworks and is now suffering from burns at a hospital. ""a lot of people were lying on the floor of the club,"" according to one young female witness. ""those of them who breathed were carried out and put in cars. the biggest problem was that each ambulance took only one person. they didn't take any more. we were yelling at doctors, forcing them to take more people at once."" igor goncharov, a perm municipal official, said city workers were helping distraught relatives, who wanted to know the fate of their loved ones. ""we work with the victims' relatives here. we give them the information about people who are in hospitals and those who were found dead and recognized by the forensic bureau,"" goncharov said. shocked residents placed flowers outside the burned club in memory of the victims, a scene that brought back memories of two other russian deadly club fires -- one in moscow in 2007 and the other in omsk in 2008. the tragedy startled russians, reeling after last week's derailment of a luxury express train from moscow to st. petersburg. that incident -- which killed 26 people and injured more than 100 others -- has been called a terror attack, the most lethal terrorist act outside of russia's troubled north caucasus region since 2004. but this latest nightclub accident, in the russian heartland around 900 miles east of moscow, is believed to have been caused by what one russian official says was the ""unsanctioned use of pyrotechnical devices."" ""the breach of technology while setting off a firework was the cause of the accident,"" said vladimir markin, a spokesman for the investigative committee of the russian prosecutor's office. ""it was not a terrorist act."" in a televised address from his country residence near moscow, president dmitry medvedev demanded that those responsible for the accident get the harshest possible punishment. he sent government officials to perm to handle the aftermath of the accident, organize medical assistance to survivors and investigate. prime minister vladimir putin dispatched two planes from moscow equipped to carry people with extensive burns. cnn's max tkachenko in moscow and luis graham-yooll in perm contributed to this report",at least five people detained in relation to fire that engulfed russian nightclub

"-- while many films spend a brief period in the spotlight before fading into obscurity, there are some which seem to grow increasingly powerful over time. nora aunor stars in ""himala"" as elsa, a young girl who changes everyone's lives when she reveals her connection to the virgin mary. lost filipino classic ""himala,"" is one such film that looks set for a revival over two decades after it was first released. web site users voted to award the late filipino director ishmael bernal's film the top prize in the cnn apsa viewers choice award for best asia-pacific film of all time, edging akira kurosawa's acknowledged classic ""seven samurai"" into second place. this comes as a late but significant accomplishment for the film which was made in 1982. ""himala"" has won numerous awards in its native philippines and remains the first and only filipino film to have been shown in competition at the prestigious berlin international film festival. ""himala,"" which means ""miracle"" in the filipino language tagalog, tells the story of a poor provincial girl named elsa who claims to have seen the virgin mary and then demonstrates the ability to cure the sick. she takes on the persona of a saint, and her sudden fame brings about a rush of changes in her community, for both better and worse. scriptwriter ricky lee, based his story on a real incident on cabra island, in mindoro occidental, philippines. in the late 1960s, reports of a young girl who had experienced visions of the virgin mary attracted salvation-seeking pilgrims and curious tourists in droves. lee wanted to create an unflinching depiction of the place of faith and religion in desperate and unforgiving times. producer charo santos-conci's first impression of the script was that the subject matter hit close to home for the filipinos, who are mostly catholic. ""this was a representation of how much faith really runs in the blood of the filipinos,"" he said, ""we're a very poor country and i think it's such a relief for us to know that this strong faith in each one of us is [what's] guiding us and propelling us to face all the challenges."" lee and bernal also collaborated closely, continuing to work on lee's original script, reworking the film's characters to make them as real as possible. filming was completed in just a month in the arid, desolate area of ilocos norte in the northern philippines, on a meager budget of just over $60,000. ilocos locals with no acting experience were hired as extras to cut costs, and lee remembers them as a genuinely wretched bunch who ""knew how it was to suffer"" and ""to pray for a miracle."" lee had insisted on having actress nora aunor, who was 29-years-old at the time, in the lead role. apart from the rising star's talent, he saw parallels with elsa in her. ""her relationship with her fans was almost like the relationship of elsa with her followers in the film and so i thought that it was a very strange and mysterious,"" says lee. and to add a supernatural twist to the film's history, aunor says that she had dreamt of the virgin mary on the night before the part of elsa was offered to her. since then aunor has become one of the philippines' biggest superstars, though ""himala"" is still considered her finest work. your say: which classic movies do you think should be resurrected? tell us below in the soundoff box. in her character's final speech in ""himala"", which both lee and santos-conci say is their favorite scene, she resolutely confesses to a motley crowd of worshippers that ""there is no miracle."" after telling the people to seek the truth within themselves, she is assassinated by a faceless follower. ""long after the film was shown, i would talk to university students and they would always ask, 'so, who killed elsa?'"" says lee of the climactic ending, which underwent several on-set rewrites. ""and i always tell them that in the end, we killed her. in the end, we killed elsa. in the end, people could not bear to hear the truth from her because they wanted to survive."" lee believes the film's message is still relevant today, particularly for filipinos, because it confronts how easily people attach their faith to almost anything they think might ease their suffering in times of hardship and despair. whatever it is that audiences see in ""himala's"" unique story, it would certainly seem that it is finally gaining the recognition it deserves.",triumph for film at international awards ceremony after more than two decades

"-- trick-or-treating and dressing in costume have been halloween traditions for a good long time now, but it seems we're still struggling to get it right. we pass judgment on the ghouls and goblins at our front steps. we bang on the doors of darkened houses. we show up to parties in offensive costumes. so here are a few halloween psas, six not-so-gentle reminders of how to keep in the holiday spirit alive and sugared up. read them, memorize them, share them and have your happiest halloween yet. give goodies to any child who shows up at the door halloween night is not the time to quibble over the quality of trick-or-treaters' costumes or whether some kids are too old to ask for free candy. and don't even bother questioning whether they're from your neighborhood, as if visitors don't deserve your snickers. last week, a letter to slate's dear prudence columnist, emily yoffe, said the majority of trick-or-treaters in the advice seeker's wealthy neighborhood appeared to be from poorer areas. ""it just bugs me, because we already pay more than enough taxes toward actual social services,"" the letter writer said. ""should halloween be a neighborhood activity, or is it legitimately a free-for-all in which people hunt down the best candy grounds for their kids?"" the rules on this are pretty obvious, as yoffe pointed out: ""stop being callous and miserly and go to costco, you cheapskate, and get enough candy to fill the bags of the kids who come one day a year to marvel at how the 1% live."" too cool for a costume? don't go to a costume party. you don't have to like halloween. you don't have to welcome trick-or-treaters. you don't have to pretend to enjoy parties where the main courses are caramel apples and candy corn. (more for us!) but if you decide to attend your pal's costume party, at least put a modicum of effort into it. it's not hard. showing up in your work clothes and saying, ""i'm an underappreciated ______ (accountant, server, journalist etc.),"" just isn't clever. if you truly can't be bothered and can't wait till plainclothes parties return next weekend, at least keep the snark to a minimum. everyone is just trying to have a little fun. it's a culture, not a costume no blackface, no whiteface, no religious symbols, no american indian garb ... shall we go on? every year on halloween, an insensitive or ignorant few fail miserably in their attempts to be edgy or clever or funny. when celebrities do this, it spurs a relentless cycle of online rage, hole-digging defenses and public apologies. it's not any prettier when it happens at your neighborhood halloween bash, your lighthearted college kegger or in your kids' class party. in recent years, students at ohio university even created a viral campaign to remind their classmates that poking fun at race or ethnicity isn't actually funny. still, it seems every year that a few miss (or ignore?) the message. don't be one of them. costumes don't have to be sexy halloween can be the perfect time for adults to show off a little something saucy. if that's your aim, go ahead. but don't do it because it seems easy or like it's the only option. after all, showing up as a barely clothed version of a not-even-kind-of-sexy thing isn't hot. it's ... awkward and, at this point, not surprising -- all the supposedly sexy gerbils, crayons and girl scouts of halloweens past beat you to it. also: brrr. isn't it october where you live, you weirdly ""sexy"" bottle of ketchup? if you're feeling like ""sexy"" costumes are the only thing available, check out the ideas at take back halloween. it offers up costume plans the average adult partygoer can pull off with a stretch of spandex required. on this dark and stormy night, look for the light it's a very simple bit of halloween communication, more powerful than all the trick-or-treating apps and maps out there: the porch light. if it's on, feel free to knock at the door or ring the bell once, screech your best ""trick or treat!"" (or tell a joke, or whatever your local candy-grabbing custom may be) and gratefully accept whatever treats you're offered. if the light is off, move along. and needless to say, don't egg the house. potential candy-givers shouldn't forget this rule, either. you don't want to send packs of ninja turtles and ""frozen"" princesses away empty-handed -- or end up eating your jumbo-size bag of smarties by yourself. or do you? spooky decor expires on november 1 unless you're committing to a haunted look all year long, there's a clear expiration date on your halloween decorations: november 1.

"-- a special prosecutor appointed in a controversial case of an alleged rape in maryville, missouri, promised on monday to review the case ""without fear and without favor."" ""i know that this case has raised a variety of concerns in northwest missouri, so please know this: this case will be thoroughly reviewed,"" jackson county prosecutor jean peters baker said. ""i can also assure you that politics, connections or any other reason you can think of will not play a role in our review of this case. it will be the evidence, as it is in every case that we review,"" she said. a judge appointed baker as special prosecutor days after a different prosecutor, who dropped charges, said he'd request the move. the alleged victim, a teenage girl, says a teenage boy raped her when she was 14. the initial prosecutor, nodaway county prosecutor robert l. rice, has said he dropped a sexual assault charge against the boy because the girl and her relatives refused to cooperate. ""there was insufficient evidence to prove a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt,"" he said in a statement. a charge against the boy's friend who was accused of recording part of the incident on an iphone was also discontinued. but the case got new life this month after the kansas city star featured it and cnn interviewed the alleged victim, daisy coleman, and her mother. why anonymous wants justice in missouri rape case after this month's reports, rice said last week that he'd ask a court to appoint a special prosecutor. cnn does not typically identify alleged victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because daisy and her mother, melinda coleman, have chosen to go public. both appeared on cnn's ""the lead with jake tapper"" on monday, one day before a planned protest in support of daisy at the nodaway county courthouse. the teenager said she and her mother would probably not be going. ""we were pondering it, but it sounds almost as if it wouldn't be safe for us to go just because of all the people in maryville being very angry with the case right now. but we are thinking about it, and we are very thankful for all the people attending,"" daisy said. when asked what she and her daughter are hoping for, melinda coleman told tapper that they just want to be heard and to have the case looked at ""fairly, and with some enthusiasm.""

""this is a moment of great testing. at such moments, there are those on both sides of this debate who will act on principle. of course, there are always some who think first of their own interests, who calculate their own advantage instead of rushing to the aid of their country,"" mccain said. meanwhile, obama blamed the current crisis on greed and irresponsibility in washington and on wall street. ""let me be perfectly clear. the fact that we are in this mess is an outrage. it's an outrage because we did not get here by accident. this was not a normal part of the business cycle. this was not the actions of a few bad apples,"" he said. after their campaign events, mccain and obama were both returning to washington to vote on the bailout package. obama's running mate, sen. joe biden, was also expected to vote on it. the bailout proposal failed in the u.s. house on monday. the version going to the senate adds provisions, including raising the federal deposit insurance corp. cap to $250,000 from $100,000 per account, and will be attached to an existing revenue bill that the house also rejected monday, according to several democratic leadership aides. mccain and obama both support raising the fdic insurance limit as a way of reviving talks on capitol hill. the senate vote is scheduled for after sundown, in observance of the jewish holiday of rosh hashanah. after pointing fingers monday, obama and mccain have both tried to strike a more bipartisan tone as they work on selling the financial rescue package to voters and reluctant members of congress. democratic sources said that they expect bipartisan support for the bill. because the tax bill must originate in the house, the senate is attaching the rescue plan to a bill that deals with renewable-energy tax incentives. this would allow the senate to vote before the house to approve a bailout bill. as the candidates focused on the economic crisis, former president clinton, who ran his own 1992 campaign on the now commonly used phrase ""it's the economy, stupid,"" stumped for obama in orlando and fort pierce, florida. clinton urged residents there to get out and vote, and he told voters why he thinks obama is the better candidate. watch what clinton says about obama » ""he's got a better philosophy; he's got better answers; he's got a better understanding and better advisers on these complex economic matters. he's got a better vice presidential partner,"" clinton said. he also said he thinks the country needs to get behind the bailout proposal. the rallies marked the first major events clinton has hosted on obama's behalf. cnn's suzanne malveaux contributed to this report.",new: obama asking congressional black caucus members to vote for bailout
"-- supporters of the rulers of bahrain threatened about 5,000 university students protesting against the government at bahrain university sunday, eyewitnesses said. the government denied that unjustified force was used. elsewhere in the strategically important kingdom, riot police fired tear gas at protesters to break up the blockade of a highway, the government said. a video posted by an opposition party showed police appearing to fire two tear gas canisters at a man standing only a few feet from them. he doubles over after the first shot, and drops to the ground after the second, which appears to hit him in the face. the man is not obviously threatening the police in the video, which was posted sunday by wefaq. the opposition party told cnn it was filmed sunday near pearl roundabout, the center of month-old protests in the kingdom. about 150 supporters of the royal family tried to get onto bahrain university campus during the protest there, but only some managed to get in. an unknown number of people were injured, but it's not clear how many or how badly. security forces tried to prevent the regime supporters from entering the campus, and allowed people to leave the grounds but not to enter. according to the state-run bahrain news agency, security forces intervened for the safety of students after clashes broke out. ""some of the university's facilities have been vandalized by the demonstrators in breach of the allegedly claimed peaceful nature of the protests,"" the news agency reported. the tense standoff was one of at least three protests sunday against the rulers of the small gulf kingdom triggered by popular demonstrations that brought down the long-time presidents of tunisia and egypt earlier this year. the latest protests came a day after america's defense secretary said he's ""convinced"" that bahrain's royal leaders are ""serious about real reform and moving forward,"" but emphasized that they must move quickly. defense secretary robert gates was visiting the restive island kingdom, where he huddled with king hamad and crown prince salman and talked about the importance of engaging with opposition forces. ""i think that the concern now is that it's important that they have somebody to talk to and that the opposition be willing to sit down with the government and carry this process forward,"" he said. sunday, the united states again called the government to pursue talks with the opposition and to refrain from using force. ""in particular, we urge our gcc (gulf cooperation council) partners to show restraint and respect the rights of the people of bahrain, and to act in a way that supports dialogue instead of undermining it,"" said white house press secretary jay carney. the crown prince similarly renewed his call for dialogue sunday, calling on the opposition to negotiate. he said talks could include discussion of parliament and corruption and that any decision reached could be put to a vote in a special referendum. the crown prince also stressed, however, the significance of bahrain's security. ""bahrain's security and the safety of its people have never been, and will never be, negotiable,"" he said in a statement. also sunday, some 250 young people organized a protest in front of bahrain financial harbor in the capital manama, witnesses said. text messages exchanged between them and others in the area warned of regime supporters approaching from muharak, another island, but it's not clear whether the warnings were accurate. police and anti-riot squads stationed near the harbor fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, leaving 20 injured, according to salmanya hospital. al wasat cameraman mohammed al-mukharaq was among the seriously injured, his editor said. the government says protest camp tents were ""removed,"" but did not say how. many protesters mobilized to block off king faisal highway to prevent the pro-regime groups from entering bahrain's main island. the government and eyewitnesses disagree about how the blockade ended. eyewitnesses and journalists say security officers asked them to disband and open the highway, and they complied. the government said attempts by uniformed police officers to persuade the protesters to re-open the road reached an impasse and that a group of protesters attacked unarmed police officers, resulting in one police officer being stabbed and another sustaining a serious head injury. police then sought to disperse approximately 350 protesters by using tear gas in order to clear the road, the government statement said. ""the ministry of interior is currently undergoing operations to reopen the king faisal highway and advised all protesters to return to the pearl roundabout for their own safety,"" the government statement said. the roundabout has been the center of protests in the kingdom for a month. bahrain, which sits in the persian gulf and is the base of the u.s. fifth fleet, has been wracked by anti-government protests since mid-february. sunni muslims -- a minority in the kingdom -- dominate the government of bahrain. the shiite muslim majority has staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, issues they say the country's sunni rulers have done little to address. many of them are in the anti-government coalition that has been demanding reform as part of the eruption of discontent sweeping across the arab world for the past several months. they have staged dramatic protests and camped out in the capital's pearl roundabout initially, protesters took to the streets of manama to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy. but some are now calling for the removal of the royal family that has led the persian gulf state since the 18th century. bahrain is in the shadow of iran, a predominantly shiite country and antagonist of bahrain's close ally, the united states. but gates told reporters saturday he ""expressed the view that we had no evidence that suggested that iran started any of these popular revolutions or demonstrations across the region."" however, he said, there's evidence that iranians ""are looking for ways to exploit"" the protracted processes unfolding in the region, ""particularly in bahrain."" three hard-line groups in the gulf kingdom -- the haq, wafa and bahrain freedom movement -- have united and called for the ruling family to step aside. the new coalition is calling for a democratic republic with no ruling family -- a step further than other opposition groups, which are calling for a constitutional monarchy. it appeared the hard-line groups represented a minority of the protesters at the roundabout. in response to the protests, the government has promised to build 50,000 new housing units and hire an additional 20,000 police officers, roughly doubling the size of the force. members of bahrain's majority shiite muslim community are not allowed to join the force. bahrain's king reshuffled his cabinet last month as protesters continued to call for reforms. he has also touted a ""national dialogue"" and urged bahrainis ""to engage in this new process"" and ""move away from polarization."" journalist mansoor al-jamri and cnn's christine theodorou, dominique van heerden, mohammed jamjoom and jenifer fenton contributed to this report.",new: bahrain's crown prince says security is not negotiable and calls for dialogue
"-- allegations of racial slurs and threats of violence against dolphins lineman jonathan martin have left pro bowler richie incognito suspended from the miami dolphins and sparked widespread chatter about just what kind of behavior is tolerated in the nfl. here are five key questions about what lies ahead: will the dolphins cut richie incognito? he's been suspended ""for conduct detrimental to the team."" as for his future, the dolphins don't seem poised to make a decision quickly. ""we reached out to the nfl to conduct an objective and thorough review,"" the team said in a statement. ""we will continue to work with the league on this matter."" but the miami herald reported that a club source told the newspaper that incognito was done with the team and will never play another game as a dolphin. and usa today cited two sources in the personnel departments of other teams that said he would have a difficult time finding another team to take a chance on him. ""i think he can file his retirement papers,"" one told the newspaper. for right now, all eyes will be on the nfl probe. incognito 'weathering the storm' does jonathan martin have a future in the nfl? the 24-year-old martin, who played at stanford before going pro, left the team last week, during his second season. no matter what the investigation finds, it's unclear whether he would want to come back. aside from the alleged threats and racial slurs from incognito, martin has rejected parts of the culture of the nfl, according to some reports. some of martin's teammates got up from a lunch table as a joke when martin sat down last week, infuriating martin, according to an analyst for foxsports.com nfl.com called it a ""lunch-room prank"" that players pulled on whoever was last to arrive with his food. former dolphins running back ricky williams told cnn the nfl is ""like a closed fraternity. it's really not made for everyone."" was there hazing, bullying, extortion? given the allegations and the environment of the nfl, it's unclear whether martin was threatened, bullied, hazed, and/or even shaken down for money. the central allegations involve voice mails in which incognito allegedly used racial slurs and threatened physical violence against martin. one transcript, published by nfl.com, includes an apparent reference to martin's biracial background. in the call, incognito allegedly referred to martin as a ""half (expletive) piece of (expletive),"" and threatened, among other things, ""i'll kill you."" incognito apparently denied the accusation, tweeting espn, which had reported the transcript, ""shame on you for attaching my name to false speculation."" the tweet and others were later deleted, according to bleacherreport.com. espn reported that incognito allegedly got martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to las vegas by a group of dolphins even though martin preferred not to travel with them. martin gave incognito the money, fearing the consequences if he did not, the report said. how common is this behavior? time magazine calls the nfl ""a naturally twisted workplace."" there is ""often a blurry line between hazing and outright abuse,"" it says. ""when your job is to be a maniac on the field, it shouldn't be surprising that a player like incognito, who has a history of anger management and substance abuse issues, could take things too far."" the attention around the martin-incognito case shines a light on that blurry line. former offensive lineman kyle turley described a hazing incident in 1998, when he and other saints rookies ran through a hallway with pillowcases on their heads while teammates punched and kicked them, time reports. still, incognito's alleged behavior shouldn't be seen as representative of many players, analysts say. ""if the evidence is factual, dolphins guard richie incognito is a racist, a bully and one of the lower forms of life known to man,"" writes sports illustrated columnist jim trotter. and while some nfl players and personnel believe martin should not have made the issue public, they're also not defending incognito, trotter says. what will the nfl do? this case could rattle the culture of the nfl. it will force the league to establish just what forms of behavior are acceptable, and what's done to make sure those standards are followed. who, if anyone, will police players when they stray from what's allowed? will coaches be held accountable? dolphins head coach joe philbin ""has to bear his share of blame here,"" usa today quotes sports illustrated's peter king as saying. ""the buck stops with him concerning what happens in the locker room ... . (t)he coach is ultimately responsible for player behavior getting out of hand."" the nfl players association issued a statement saying it expects ""that the nfl and its clubs create a safe and professional workplace for all players, and that owners, executives, coaches and players should set the best standards and examples."" as the nfl launches its probe, it could find itself officially informed of numerous other incidents throughout the league. this one case between two men could prove the catalyst for the league to acknowledge and deal with disturbing behavior in its ranks.",recent allegations have sparked chatter about just what kind of behavior is tolerated in the nfl
"-- celebrating the traditional lantern festival this week, many beijing residents spent a lot of money dining out and setting off fireworks to mark the end of the chinese lunar new year. ""for the rich the money they spend is mere peanuts,"" says mei yana, a migrant from rural henan province working as a restaurant waitress. aren't chinese getting battered with high inflation? ""that's the ordinary people's worry,"" she said. the annual ""blue book of china's society"" compiled by the chinese academy of social sciences noted that last year rising prices topped the list of the public's concerns. the consumer price index, a gauge of inflation, hit 5.1% last november, despite government pledges to rein it in at just 3 percent. now hovering around 5%, cpi may seem manageable, but its food component is around 10%, with certain items soaring even faster. ""prices of meat, fish and vegetables have gone way up,"" complained wang rongfang, a 68-year-old pensioner shopping at the xinyuanli market in beijing. sometimes inflation pinches in disguised ways. in local retail stores visited by a chongqing evening news reporter, prices of some instant noodle brands were unchanged, while the weight of their packages fell from 95g to 85g. some residents make ends meet by scrimping, others with black humor. jokes circulating on chinese-language websites offer suggestions on how to save money in inflationary times. ""tell disgusting jokes to stop your wife from eating,"" says one. another, in citing the soaring prices of meat, goes: ""my son has graduated with a phd. he is considering whether to work for a software company or the pork business."" but inflation is no joking matter for china's communist party rulers, as soaring costs could trigger social instability. ""the communist party came into power in 1949 in part due to hyperinflation after world war ii that broke the back of the chinese economy and the nationalist regime,"" says patrick chovanec, associate professor at tsinghua university school of economics and management in beijing. ""they know they nearly lost power in 1989 in part due to anger over rising inflation that fueled the tiananmen protests."" the chinese government has taken measures to curb inflation, from offering more subsidies for farmers to produce more essential goods to imposing price controls on scarce goods and government services. in recent months, china has tapped on the brakes to cool the overheated economy, albeit with limited success. some analysts say prompt government measures are mitigating risks to avert a repeat of the tiananmen square unrest in 1989, when beijing witnessed massive street protests that ended in a bloody crackdown on june 4. ""the current 5% inflation rate is far below the 20% in may 1989,"" said wenfang tang, a political science professor at the university of iowa in the united states. ""prices have been rising continuously in the past several years, so it is not a shock to most people in china."" still, some economists say the cpi is only one measure of inflation and does not capture the full inflationary pressure in china's economy today. china's money supply, they say, has expanded by more than 50% over the past two years -- the stimulus fueling china's red-hot growth rates. with such monetary expansion, the question isn't why china is battered by inflation, but why china hasn't seen more inflation sooner. one explanation: all the new money printed went mainly into an investment boom, not a consumption boom. state banks lent out new money, which went to bid up the price of land, the price of commodities -- into so-called ""asset inflation."" asset inflation, experts say, does not feel like inflation. ""when the price of bread doubles, it feels like it's getting harder to make ends meet,"" says chovanec of tsinghua. ""when the price of high-end condos doubles, it feels like smart investors are getting rich -- it feels like a boom."" eventually, the asset inflation spills into the general price level. ""in my view, that's the real worry in china -- that what we're seeing in terms of cpi rates could just be the tip of the inflation iceberg,"" chovanec added. by incrementally raising interest rates and reserve requirement ratio for banks, china has slowed down its inflation rate but only modestly. ultimately, experts say, what china needs to do is tighten its money supply, which is still growing at nearly 20% yearly.","""blue book of china's china's society"": rising prices topped public's concerns last year"
"-- though he told authorities that the devil made him do it, satanists disapproved, after a man allegedly shattered a stone copy of the ten commandments last week. the man is accused of running his car on friday into a controversial 6-foot-tall granite tablet of the biblical edicts erected near oklahoma city's capitol, cnn affiliate kfor reported. he then left his car standing near the monument, which -- as photos showed -- was smashed asunder through the second commandment: ""thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain."" he walked into the federal building, where he made threats against president obama and the federal government, kfor reported, citing u.s. secret service agents. the man told the agents that the devil made him wreck the religious monument, which was placed at the capitol in late 2012. he also said he was mentally ill and had stopped taking his medication. he has been detained at a mental health facility for evaluation. condemnation of the destruction came quickly from two sources that have railed against the monument -- the aclu of oklahoma and the satanic temple. the aclu filed suit last year against the presence of the monument on state property, and on friday, said that it would keep fighting for its removal, because it feels it violates the constitution. but the organization was also ""outraged at this apparent act of vandalism."" ""the ten commandments constitute a strong foundation in our clients' deeply held religious beliefs,"" the oklahoma aclu said in a statement. the satanic temple has demanded to have a monument of its own erected next to the judeo-christian one. and it still wants it, but ""only alongside the 10 commandments,"" it said in a statement posted by kfor. ""if our monument stands at the state capitol, we want it to complement and contrast the ten commandments, with both standing unmolested as a testament to american religious freedom and tolerance."" the satanists could well have that wish fulfilled, but only in part. oklahoma gov. mary fallin has vowed to have the ten commandments monument rebuilt. .",a man allegedly rams his car into a ten commandments monument

"-- a school security chief gave an emotional account thursday of his shootout with a florida man who held school board members hostage before opening fire. mikes jones with bay district schools in panama city told hln ""prime news"" he was afraid the system's superintendent was dead after clay duke, 56, pointed a handgun at the leader and opened fire tuesday afternoon. everything around me was just silent. it was in slow motion,"" said jones, a former school board member and a retired panama city police officer. superintendent bill husfelt then raised his head above the counter after the shooting incident, in which at least 15 shots were fired. ""i couldn't believe he was alive,"" jones told hln. after a day spending time with his pastor and family, jones talked with the media about the gun battle that took place during a routine school board meeting. ""when he fired the first shot, i had no recourse. it was a gun battle,"" mike jones told reporters about his encounter with duke. ""i'm not a hero. i had just done my job."" jones, who is known as the affable ""salvage santa"" for his charity work, said his ""heart goes out"" to the family of duke, who his wife described as having bipolar disorder. ""i just want to get right with god about this and right with my church about what had happened,"" said jones. duke's widow, rebecca crowder-duke, apologized for her husband's actions and said she understood that jones was doing what he was ""trained to do."" jones wasn't supposed to be at the routine meeting, but swung by in case there were questions about a remodeling matter related to his job. ""i wasn't in the building five minutes that i got into the gunfight."" he said he got a call about the dramatic confrontation and went downstairs. inside, duke had approached the front of the room, spray-painted a red ""v"" with a circle around it on the wall and brandished a handgun. he ordered the room cleared of everyone but six men and got into a discourse with board members and husfelt about several issues, including the termination of duke's wife. jones did a ""peeka-boo"" look into the room, hoping duke would come out. the officer, who recently received rapid response training, went to his vehicle to get a protective vest and more ammunition and returned. ""i was peeking through the crack of the door and when i saw his back and he was squared up with both hands i knew that the fight was fixing to happen,"" said jones. but the officer said he could not get a clear line of fire on duke. a chilling video of the meeting, from a live internet feed provided by cnn affiliates wjhg and wmbb, shows husfelt attempting to reason with duke. husfelt pleaded with duke to allow the other members to leave the room. ""will you let them go? you're obviously upset at me, so why are they here?"" he asked on the video. at one point, husfelt told duke, ""i don't want anybody to get hurt. i've got a feeling that's what you want, is you want the cops to come in and kill you because you are mad, because you said you are going to die. but why? this isn't worth it."" duke then pointed the pistol at husfelt, who said, ""please don't. please don't. please."" but duke pulled the trigger as husfelt and the others hit the floor. the gunman fired several times, missing everyone. crowder-duke told wjhg on wednesday that her husband, who she described as having bipolar disorder and unable to get work recently because of his prior criminal record, intentionally fired over the people and did not intend to harm them. ""if he really wanted to shoot anybody, they (would have) already been dead,"" said crowder-duke, who police say was terminated as a teacher this year. she said she had received praise from her principal. jones said he believed the superintendent had been shot. he opened the door with one hand and opened fire with the other, wounding duke three times in a gunfire exchange. the suspect fell to the floor and fatally shot himself in the head, police said. wjhg reported that jones was taken to a hospital with chest pains after the incident. the officer said he first struck duke in the back and was worried he might go to jail. ""there's just so many things that go through your mind. it was instinct and training."" jones told reporters he feels husfelt deserved the accolades for asking duke to let the other school board members go. ""mike and his timing saved our lives,"" husfelt said. but it was evident at thursday's press conference the incident took a toll on jones. ""the first thing that came to mind (was) what is this community going to think of me?"" he said. ""i'm known as salvage santa, this nice guy. now i've taken somebody's life."" crowder-duke said she has no animosity toward jones. ""i don't fault you for (the shooting). i know you were just doing what you were trained to do, and i'm sorry that god had to choose you to do that because you are a very kind, sweet, generous man,"" crowder-duke told wjhg. husfelt said the district would re-evaluate security in the wake of the incident but said he doubted security would have made a difference. ""we could have had this place like fort knox. ... there was nothing we could have done to stop him."" for 27 years, jones has restored bicycles, raised money and collected toys to be given away to needy children, according to the panama city news herald. the officer said he would be at a local store thursday night to further the effort.",security chief said he was afraid gunman killed superintendent
"london, england -- a new tool that allows doctors to use laser surgery in complex operations has been hailed as a breakthrough in minimally invasive laser technology. this fiber optic tool is made from the perfect mirror, making it possible to reflect co2 lasers for the first time. originally designed as a military tool for the united states department of defense (dod), the fiber-optic invention is revolutionizing the ways surgeons carry out brain surgeries. the ""omni directional dielectric mirror"" was created by professor yoel fink, a then-29-year-old student in material science at the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) in 1995. ""i was asked to participate in a project funded by the dod to create the perfect mirror,"" fink told cnn. ""the perfect mirror reflects light from all angles and does not absorb any of it. it could have been used, for example, to reflect back enemy laser beams,"" he continued darpa, the defense advanced research projects agency, a subsection of the dod, specialize in technologies they believe are about 25 years away from being realized and try to make them happen in five years' time. but they didn't have a long wait before they found their perfect mirror. ""to my own surprise, i found the answer during the very first meeting. i thought everyone would laugh at my suggestion, so i waited until the last two minutes to talk and after i did, the room just fell silent,"" fink, a former commander in the israeli army, told cnn. he found that by taking two materials with different optical properties (one being a semi-conducting glass and one being a polymer) and stacking these two up in very tight and ultra thin layers, around 1 micron each (1/1000 of a millimeter), they create an omni-reflector. the most important part of his discovery, however, was that by changing only the thickness and distance of the layers, the ""perfect mirror"" could reflect any type of electromagnetic energy in any wavelength. this meant fink's invention was useful not only in the military and telecommunications field, but could also be used in minimally invasive laser surgery -- the use of lasers rather than scalpels to operate on everything from tumors, deafness and spine injuries. this type of surgery is known to reduce recovery time, the likelihood of complications and incision size. in many cases, patients also spend less time ""under the knife."" fink then set about creating a pen-shaped fiber-optic tool that could allow surgeons to easily manipulate the laser and bend it to reach almost any tissue in the body. the results, according to some surgeons who have used it, are astonishing. dr. stanley shapshay, a renowned american ear nose and throat surgeon and former president of the triological society told cnn: ""when yoel first called me to show me his fiber-optic tool made out of this perfect mirror, i was very skeptical as i had seen many unsuccessful trials."" ""but as soon as we did the first tests, i was simply blown away,"" he added. dr. shapshay has now performed over 100 operations with the ""perfect mirror laser"" and says he finds it almost easier to use than a scalpel. dr. bendok, a senior neurosurgeon at northwestern university in the united states, along with his partner, otolaryngologist dr andrew fishman, also rave about the benefit of the fiber optic tool in minimally invasive surgery. in a recent case, dr. bendok's patient had a tumor at the base of the brain, a tumor that could have been more difficult and dangerous to remove without fink's device. ""using the scalpel could have caused a stroke,"" dr. fishman told cnn. ""instead we used co2 laser to melt the tumor and then shave it off."" the whole operation took less than an hour and the patient recovered in only three days. according to dr. shapshay, the perfect mirror is also an important development because, for years, doctors were able to treat patients with lasers in only limited circumstances and with many complications. until the ""perfect mirror"" came along there were no fibers that could transport the safer co2 lasers. surgeons had to shoot the laser beam directly from its large generator and could do so only at a straight angle, rendering it impossible to reach deeper tissues. ""at the time, co2 lasers were like the perfect weapon for soldiers, but one that also happened to weigh five tons. they were very cumbersome,"" says dr. shapshay. the surgeons believe laser technology will now become more widespread with the avenue of this tool that is ""easy and intuitive to use."" next on fink's to-do list is to take his fibers worldwide, especially in europe, the middle east and asia. his company, omni guide, aims to expand the tool globally: most clinics using it are currently in the united states. ""i hope it can help patients around the world,"" he said.",perfect mirror is used to simplify and expand use of minimally invasive laser surgery
"-- sara lugger was skeptical as she placed her first $5 bet. but she realized that all she had to lose was weight -- and a few bucks if the money didn't motivate her to get in shape. a friend's success had inspired lugger to join dietbet, a website that hosts private and public games where people can bet on their own weight loss. each game sets a goal, such as losing 4% of your body weight, and users who reach that goal split the pot. lugger was 34 and weighed 342 pounds. she had struggled with obesity most of her life. in the ninth grade, she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and doctors put her on prednisone. the steroid made it difficult for her to maintain a normal weight. but in 2004, lugger had surgery to fix the colitis. ""from there on out, i couldn't blame anything but my poor habits."" shortly after her birthday in february 2013, lugger decided that reaching 350 pounds would be ""unacceptable."" the oxford, michigan, resident realized that her weight was holding her back from doing the things she wanted to do. she had been the heaviest person in her college classes, where she studied to become a physical therapist. and although family and friends never said anything outright, she noticed they didn't exactly try to set her up on dates. she avoided social situations and outdoor activities that might call attention to her size, and she worried about traveling because fitting in an airplane seat was difficult. ""for weeks before i flew, that would be on my mind,"" she said. after signing up for dietbet, lugger made a plan. she threw out all the junk food in her house. she decided she would wake up 30 minutes early every morning to work out on her elliptical machine. then, at lunch, she would use the physical therapy equipment at her office to strength train. that way, if she wanted to go out with friends in the evening, she wouldn't miss a workout. upwave: don't miss a workout with the one-minute workout challenge ""i have never seen her so driven and persistent on a goal,"" her friend travis summerville said. ""i don't know where that came from, but she chose a simple exercise regimen and diet style that worked well for her, and she just kept at it consistently."" lugger traded her morning bowl of cereal for a protein shake. she stopped frequenting fast-food places and instead used pinterest to find lighter fare to cook at home. she now keeps to a 1,200-calorie-a-day diet. ""i'm kind of an all-or-nothing person,"" she said. ""i can't (just) lean into things, or it doesn't happen."" losing weight did happen. lugger loved the support she found from her group on dietbet and signed up for two more games after the first one ended. over time, she upped her bets to $10 and then $50 as she gained confidence -- and lost 140 pounds. lugger's friend christie williams has also lost 60 pounds using the site. looking back, williams is amazed at how heavy she and lugger once were. but what she's always loved about her friend is still there, williams says. ""i don't believe sara has changed as a person. she still laughs loud, dances crazy and screams at the wrong parts in horror movies. what has changed is the activities we do. it's not always takeout pizza and two movies. we'll go walk a couple of miles or play ""just dance"" before we go out to eat."" the friends are training for an upcoming 5k and helping each other maintain their slimmer figures. ""we are holding each other accountable,"" williams said. ""my biggest fear was (lugger) having a heart attack at age 45. that fear is gone, and i don't want it back. ... it's never going to be easy, but it will be easier than losing her at a young age."" overall, lugger has won more than $330 on dietbet. she's also won a new outlook on life. lugger used to tell her friends -- and herself -- that she didn't like basketball because she knew she wouldn't fit into the arena seats. now she's a detroit pistons fan. ""turns out, i really like basketball,"" she said with a laugh. lugger is also traveling more. and shopping. she loves dressing in clothes she feels express her style instead of trying to hide in the background. ""i'm finding me more, and that's a really neat thing.""","at her heaviest, sara lugger weighed 342 pounds"

""at that moment, the word of 'traitor' arose in my mind."" dangerous waters: behind the islands dispute the day after his controversial remarks, hatoyama, 66, and his wife visited the nanjing memorial, which is for the estimated 300,000 people killed in a 1937 massacre by japanese forces. he is the third former japanese prime minister to visit the memorial, following predecessors toshiki kaifu and tomiichi murayama. the tribute for chinese victims stands in contrast to visits by japanese officials, including prime minister shinzo abe and predecessor junichiro koizumi, to the controversial yasukuni shrine in tokyo, which is dedicated to japan's war dead, including war criminals. ""in the eyes of the chinese public, (hatoyama's) visit is very valuable and undermines those in china who argue that all japanese suffer from amnesia about wartime misdeeds,"" said jeff kingston, director of asian studies at temple university japan. ""i think this mission is an effort by him to introduce a different tenor into bilateral relations, to show it's not all about saber-rattling,"" he added. chinese media extensively covered hatoyama's ""apology for japan's wartime crimes,"" with pictures of the hatoyamas bowing and paying silent tribute at the site. on social media, the visit triggered wide discussions. according to an online poll by phoenix online (ifeng), 80% of the more than 222,000 people who voted said hatoyama's visit did not have much political significance, as compared with german chancellor willy brandt's kneeling before the warsaw ghetto memorial in 1970. in another question, nearly two-thirds of 140,000 people surveyed said the visit by a former leader wouldn't set an example for a fellow japanese politician. cctv commentator yang yu, however, praised hatoyama and urged the chinese to ""remember the unusual kindness due to its scarcity,"" saying via weibo, the microblogging site, ""we have reprimanded japan too many times for not acknowledging the massacre."" the official account from xinhua, china's state-run news agency, warned that the nationalism of people who ""scold any japanese they see ... is in fact leading the country to distress."" an editorial by the government-run global times said that ""china shouldn't change its policy to japan just because hatoyama, a politician currently out of office, gave a few words of friendship."" grievances over world war ii atrocities added fuel to violent anti-japanese protests in china in september, particularly on the anniversary of the 1931 japanese invasion of china. and it is not a coincidence, kingston said, that a chinese plane entered airspace over the disputed islands -- prompting japan to scramble fighter jets -- on december 13, the 75th anniversary of the massacre. it was the first time that the territorial dispute involved planes. ""the next day on the front page of the newspapers were the images of the (nanjing) memorial ceremony and the planes,"" kingston said. the dispute over the islands stems from 1895, when, at the end of the sino-japanese war, japan annexed them. china has said that the islands have been its territory for the last five centuries. cnn's steven jiang and dayu zhang in beijing and junko ogura in tokyo contributed to this report.",hatoyama contradicts japan's position of indisputable territorial sovereignty over islands

"-- amy poehler drew a standing ovation when she initiated an impromptu pageant during the outstanding lead actress in a comedy category at the 2011 emmy awards. at the 2012 golden globes, tina fey made viewers do a double take, photo-bombing poehler as the nominees were announced for best actress in a tv comedy or musical. the ""parks and recreation"" and ""30 rock"" stars have been stealing the spotlight at awards shows as presenters and nominees for years. as suzy byrne of yahoo! entertainment says, ""it's almost like they've been practicing for this."" ""this"" being their gig co-hosting the 70th golden globes, to air on nbc on january 13. the news, which broke monday evening, was met with such excitement from fans, celebrities and the media that many were left wondering, ""seth mac-who?"" it was announced this month that ""family guy"" creator macfarlane would host the 85th academy awards. it's still considered a great get for the oscars, which have been fixated on attracting a younger demographic, but all anybody seems to care about is the fey/poehler globes. tim brooks, an author, tv historian and former network executive, told the hollywood reporter of macfarlane's appeal, ""younger viewers probably know the name, but he's not an a star."" it should be noted, however, that macfarlane's ""ted"" recently broke a box office record: the flick about a teddy bear that comes to life has surpassed ""the hangover"" as the highest-grossing non-sequel r-rated comedy worldwide. meanwhile, brooks said of the globes pick, ""tina fey is a good choice, particularly. she's appealing to younger and older viewers. she's accessible. she's not too trendy but trendy enough."" poehler has similar range. before starring on ""parks and recreation,"" she appeared alongside fey on ""saturday night live"" and in ""mean girls"" and ""baby mama,"" in addition to films like ""wet hot american summer"" and ""blades of glory.""

""i have the deep belief that we honor the members of the academy,"" she said. ""in other words, what are the golden globes about? what are we honoring? everyone we're honoring there is a member of the academy, right? where's the competition?"" the fey/poehler pick was made because ""they're obviously very pleasant to look at, and ... they play off of each other beautifully,"" takla-o'reilly added, noting that she enjoyed their skit at the 2011 emmy awards. even ricky gervais, who hosted the globes in 2010, 2011 and 2012, had kind words for the ladies: ""good luck to tina fey and amy poehler at the golden globes. after failing three years in a row to make e! channel's best dressed list, i decided to hand over the reins."" this is the pair that viewers have been waiting to see, yahoo! entertainment's byrne said. it's not that people are expecting these women to get on stage and reinvent awards shows; it's that they're looking forward to hearing smart jokes.

"-- a woman to woman talk between oprah winfrey and the former head of her south african girls school ended with the settlement of a defamation lawsuit against the talk show host, their lawyers said. lerato nomvuyo mzamane sued winfrey, contending she defamed mzamane when talking about an abuse scandal at the school she ran in 2007. the case was set for trial in philadelphia, pennsylvania, starting march 29. ""the two parties met woman to woman without their lawyers and are happy that they could resolve this dispute peacefully to their mutual satisfaction,"" the attorneys said in a joint statement tuesday. mzamane was immediately suspended and later fired after several students at winfrey's south african leadership academy complained about abuse. a dorm mother was later charged with abusing and assaulting students. the lawsuit contended that winfrey's statements at a private meeting with parents, which later became public, and at a news conference defamed the headmistress by implying she knew of the abuse and covered it up. mzamane said the abuse complaints were never brought to her and that winfrey never let her explain. ""ms. winfrey testified in her deposition that she did not intend the implications placed on her words by the plaintiff,"" the joint statement said. ""ms. mzamane testified in her deposition that she has no evidence that ms. winfrey knowingly made a false statement about her or entertained serious doubt about the truth of what she said."" u.s. district judge eduardo robreno ruled a week ago that winfrey's comments could potentially be interpreted by a jury to be defamatory. the decision cleared the path for a trial. the suit quoted winfrey telling parents that ""any person that has caused harm"" to students would be let go. in the next sentence, winfrey said she fired mzamane because she had lost confidence in her ability to run the school. winfrey also told the parents that when students brought their complaints to the headmistress, she ""had not taken them seriously,"" the suit said. the suit said one winfrey quote cited suggested mzamane, a native of the african kingdom of lesotho, did not have a high-enough level of care for the students: ""it was my intention by putting somebody in charge who was african, and was female, i believed that she would care as much for these girls as i do myself. i'm sorry i was let down."" mzamane's suit said the damage to her reputation resulted in her not being able to get another education job for a year. when winfrey opened the school at the beginning of 2007, she said she hoped it would provide opportunities to girls from poor backgrounds. she personally approved each of the students, many of whom were at the top of their classes.",the talk show host founded a girls leadership school in south africa in 2007
"-- he's known as the ""merchant of death"" and the ""lord of war,"" -- an alleged international arms dealer straight out of a cloak-and-dagger spy novel who eluded authorities for years and inspired hollywood villains. but in reality, according to those who have seen or met viktor bout, he is a somber man, sometimes nattily dressed, a wheeler-dealer who has insisted he is innocent of the allegations leveled against him. bout, a russian citizen and former military officer, speaks six languages ""and i could see him bargaining in all six at the same time,"" wrote cnn's jill dougherty in 2008, recalling her meeting with bout in 2002 in moscow, russia. bout arrived in new york late tuesday after being extradited from thailand. he faces charges in the united states of conspiring to kill u.s. nationals, conspiring to kill u.s. officers or employees, conspiring to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile and conspiring to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization. american law enforcement officers have spent years pursuing him, and the extradition process from thailand was an arduous one for them. bout is accused of supplying weapons to war zones around the world, from sierra leone to afghanistan. before his 2008 arrest, u.s. drug enforcement administration agents led a sting operation by posing as members of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc), officials said. ""his early days are a mystery,"" said douglas farah, a senior fellow at the international assessment and strategy center who co-authored a book on bout. farah told mother jones magazine in 2007 that according to his multiple passports, bout was born in 1967 in dushanbe, tajikistan, the son of a bookkeeper and an auto mechanic. a pro-bout website -- farah said bout put it up himself -- says he was born into an ""average home and an average family"" and that his parents were employees in the ""administrative and accounting fields."" but, farah said, some reports are that bout's parents were involved in intelligence. ""his mother was supposedly very high in the kgb,"" farah said, adding that bout has consistently denied that. ""he graduated from the military institute on foreign languages, a well-known feeder school for russian military intelligence, and is known to have a true gift for languages,"" farah told mother jones. bout has said that he worked as a military officer in mozambique. others have said it was actually angola -- which would make sense, as russia had a large military presence there at the time, farah told cnn. he said bout's rise stemmed from the end of communism and the rise of capitalism in the early 1990s in the former soviet bloc. ""he was a soviet officer, most likely a lieutenant, who simply saw the opportunities presented by three factors that came with the collapse of the ussr and the state sponsorship that entailed: abandoned aircraft on the runways from moscow to kiev, no longer able to fly because of the lack of money for fuel or maintenance; huge stores of surplus weapons that were guarded by guards suddenly receiving little or no salary; and the booming demand for those weapons from traditional soviet clients and newly emerging armed groups from africa to the philippines,"" farah told the magazine. ""he simply wedded the three things, taking aircraft for almost nothing, filling them with cheaply purchased weapons from the arsenals, and flying them to clients who could pay."" ""he knew the african market,"" farah said wednesday. ""he was clearly aware of who [russia's] past clients had been ... i think he had foresight, and i think he understood the world changes much more than the average soviet bloc person."" he first became known when the united nations began investigating him in the early-to-mid 1990s and the united states began to get involved, farah told cnn. bout's website, which spells his name victor, says he became notorious because of a smear campaign, ""fictitious tales and stories which were generated from one source -- a corrupt united nations contractor who was generously paid for the u.n. contracts he arranged with the help of others for victor's companies, and then became mad for vengeance when victor refused to continue paying him."" the site said the united states case against him is based on ""lies"" and paid informants. attempts by cnn to contact bout's wife were unsuccessful wednesday. ironically, the united states is also among bout's clients, even indirectly, farah said wednesday. bout companies were used to fly for government contractors in iraq. most of those flights -- estimated in the hundreds -- occurred after then-president george w. bush had signed an executive order making it illegal to do business with bout because he represented a security threat to the united states, farah told mother jones. ""the state department, under a congressional inquiry initiated by sen. russell feingold, found it had used bout companies, acknowledged it, and stopped,"" farah told the magazine. ""...despite the public revelation, the congressional inquiry, the executive order and a subsequent treasury department order freezing the assets of bout and his closest associates, the flights continued for many months, at least until the end of 2005."" the united states did not have the airlift capacity to go in at the time, farah said wednesday. but bout had planes close by, in the united arab emirates, and ""he was willing to fly without insurance. he paid pilots a flat rate."" at one point, the state and treasury departments were going after bout while the department of defense continued to pay him. ""it was one of those contradictory situations,"" farah said. farah told cnn he believes the trial against bout will be quick, as he doesn't believe anyone wants bout to tell what he knows -- because he knows a lot. his knowledge could potentially embarrass not only russia, but the united nations, the united states and britain, among others, he said. ""i don't think they're going to have a wide-ranging free-for-all."" and so far, ""he's apparently been a stand-up guy to the russians,"" and hasn't threatened to turn on them, farah said. for one thing, they have his family, which is ""considerable leverage"" -- bout is widely known to be a family man, farah wrote in august in foreign policy magazine. ""he endured more than two years in a thai prison, losing more than 70 pounds and never showing any signs of doubting he would ultimately walk away,"" farah wrote in the article. ""he has been, so far, a soldier's soldier."" that's largely in line with how bout views himself, farah said wednesday -- as a soldier and a businessman. ""i think everyone agrees on a personal level, he's very charming. he's very articulate, very sort of well-mannered and obviously a very smart guy,"" he said, adding bout has never considered himself as a ""trigger-puller or bad guy."" ""i don't think he views himself as having any blood on his hands,"" he said. in addition, bout approached the cia and the fbi through an intermediary just after the september 11, 2001 attacks on new york and washington, offering to help oust the taliban if paid tens of millions, farah told mother jones. ""negotiations were serious and lasted several months, but we do not know what, if any, parts of the deal he offered were accepted."" but in 2002, when he met with dougherty, bout was interested in setting the record straight. he traveled with a bodyguard and a female aide, dougherty said, and was ""dressed in a well-cut dark jacket with gold buttons, grey trousers, white shirt and basket-weave-patterned silk tie."" he also sported a wool topcoat. ""his english was quite good,"" dougherty recalled. ""he seemed intelligent, canny; serious but nervous."" she said he was ""tall, heavy-set, a bit rough around the edges, but he acted like a man who has been wronged."" she asked him about allegations against him -- did he sell arms to the taliban? to al qaeda? did he supply rebels in africa and get paid in blood diamonds? -- and he denied each one. ""it's a false allegation and it's a lie,"" he said. ""i've never touched diamonds in my life and i'm not a diamond guy and i don't want that business."" ""i'm not afraid,"" he told dougherty. ""i didn't do anything in my life i should be afraid of. and all this looks to me like a witch hunt. look, i'm coming to your office, i have no problem. and i said, 'hey, who's looking for me?' i'm here. i'm not hiding from nobody. and i don't want this story going on."" dougherty asked him if he had ever met osama bin laden, and he said no, adding that if he had, he might have helped prevent the 9/11 attacks. farah believes bout's downfall was insisting on closing the supposed ""deal"" with farc himself. ""he was more than happy to say he knew the weapons would be used to kill americans,"" he said wednesday. meanwhile, bout himself -- who reportedly has used names including ""victor anatoliyevich bout,"" ""victor but,"" ""viktor butt,"" ""viktor bulakin"" and ""vadim markovich aminov"" -- is thought to have been the inspiration for the arms-dealer character played by nicolas cage in the 2005 movie ""lord of war."" ""someone will undoubtedly write a book about this case some day, and i can tell you that it will read like the very best work of tom clancy, only in this case it won't be fiction,"" michael braun, then assistant administrator and chief of operations for the dea, told cnn in 2008. much of what bout is alleged to have done is morally reprehensible, but not illegal, farah said, noting there are no penalties for violating un weapons sanctions.

"-- opener tillakaratne dilshan scored a superb century as sri lanka forced their way back on the second day of the first test against india in ahmedabad. dilshan smashed 112 and featured in solid partnerships with fellow-opener tharanga paranavitana (35) and captain kumar sangakkara (31) as sri lanka completed a day of dominance. fast bowler zaheer khan opened a window of opportunity for the hosts by snaring dilshan and sangakkara in successive overs in the final session, but mahela jayawardene (36 not out) and thilan samaraweera, five from a half-century, denied the home side further inroads as sri lanka ended on 275 for three, 151 in deficit. zaheer had looked menacing with the new ball, but with little assistance from the pitch, sri lanka were off to a good start and dilshan looked comfortable. together with left-handed paranavitana, dilshan added 74 for the opening wicket at a brisk pace, effectively putting the pressure back on the home side. ishant sharma eventually severed that stand, forcing paranavitana to fend at a delivery that moved away a touch and he edged to wicketkeeper mahendra singh dhoni who held an excellent catch in front of first slip. save for that burst from zaheer with the new ball, india's attack had looked ordinary and it allowed sangakkara to hit his stride. with the sri lankan skipper holding up one end, dilshan continued to play freely and eventually reached his 10th test hundred -- his fifth this year -- by cutting leg-spinner ishant for a boundary. the two had added 115 for the second wicket when zaheer produced another fine burst to snare both batsmen. dilshan was tempted with a short ball, but mistimed his pull and ended up presenting rahul dravid a simple catch at gully. sangakkara was also done by a short ball, the captain top edging to sachin tendulkar at fine leg. the twin dismissal left sri lanka at 194 for three, but mahela and samaraweera put the visitors' pursuit back on track. both batsmen began cautiously until samaraweera, who has already scored 1083 runs in eight tests in this calendar year, shed the shackles by driving mishra for consecutive boundaries. the fourth-wicket pair have so far added 81 in an unbroken stand. in the morning, master spinner muttiah muralitharan finished with three wickets as the hosts were bowled out in the first session. muralitharan, who had snared yuvraj on monday, added the wickets of tailenders harbhajan singh and ishant to his tally, while fast bowler chanaka welegedara removed dravid, the batsman falling without adding to his overnight score of 177. dravid fell in the third over of the morning, welegedara collecting his fourth wicket by bowling the batsman via an inside edge as he attempted to drive. harbhajan, two overnight, then added 25 for the eighth wicket with zaheer taking india's total past the 400-run mark in the process. but sri lanka's spinners made short work of the tail. left-arm spinner rangana herath trapped zaheer in front, while muralitharan claimed the wickets of harbhajan and last man ishant to finish with a three-wicket haul.",opener tillakaratne dilshan scores a superb century for sri lanka against india

""hurt locker"" actually lost out to ""avatar"" in the globes race, and that might have been a well-timed boon for the small flick. it positioned it perfectly as the underdog going into the home stretch of the campaign. besides the cachet of an oscar win, the successful campaign typically pays for itself in dividends. in the nine months after ""the hurt locker's"" oscar win, the film sold more than $31 million worth of dvds in the united states, 214% of its u.s. box office gross of $14.7 million. that's what makes oscar campaigning more than a $100 million-a-year cottage industry within the movie industry. persuading members of the academy to first nominate your film and then vote for it is tremendously similar to how political operatives get candidates elected. there is no single strategy for a successful oscar campaign, but momentum is key. peak too early and excitement peters out; peak too late and you've spent millions of dollars without enough time to get voters invested. building momentum involves racking up accolades and awards from individual guilds and film festivals before the nomination voting in january. this year weinstein is making sure ""the artist"" gathers momentum at just the right time. it took home a golden globe and its lead actor, jean dujardin, brought home a best actor sag. but it has yet to peak. how is momentum built? and why does it cost millions? after all, word of mouth is free. but an intricate web of gypsy publicists, rogue party planners, and entire full-service consultancies to generate that all-important buzz that drives a campaign can run more than $2 million. sure, a dvd can be mailed for less than $2. but with elaborate packaging, express mailing and hand delivery, the cost can increase to $200 each. with 6,000 academy members, that translates to more than $1 million to get the films in front of voters. one of the stealthier tactics of good campaigners is the third-party oscar party, where someone who is not in the academy hosts an event celebrating a film starring one of their good friends. the expenses for these can easily run to $2 million, which is often somehow subsidized by the studio. like a good show-pony politician, the cast of a film needs to be tirelessly glad-handing voters and going to every event to fluff their film. if a movie's main players aren't willing to commit to living and breathing and fighting for their film for the two months leading up to the oscars, they can forget about taking home a statue. bills can run into the millions to fly the talent back and forth across the country and keep them upright and happy during the final stretch. then there are screening costs and advertising costs. full-page ads in trade magazines like variety and the hollywood reporter can cost $25,000 each, with ad budgets ranging from $15,000 to $1 million. political campaign tricks are obvious. not so for oscar campaigns. selecting the leader of the free world may hold far greater stakes than what to put on your netflix queue, but they both deserve a high level of transparency. audiences deserve to know what goes into an oscar win before they give it credence. follow cnn opinion on twitter join the conversation on facebook the opinions in this commentary are solely those of jo piazza.",jo piazza: campaign of prettier people with better hair rages on in hollywood
"-- when it comes to 2016, hillary clinton is in no rush to decide about another run for the white house. this amid mounting speculation that clinton will launch another bid, and with everything she says, and every move she makes, scrutinized for signals of where she stands when it comes to her political future. ""i'm not in any hurry. i think it's a serious decision, not to be made lightly, but it's also not one that has to be made soon,"" clinton told new york magazine in her first interview since retiring as secretary of state at the beginning of this year. far from her denials in interviews at the beginning of the year, when she told cnn that she had ""absolutely no plans to run,"" clinton now appears to be wrestling with a decision, saying in the new york magazine interview that ""i will just continue to weigh what the factors are that would influence me making a decision."" hillary clinton on 2016 run: 'i'm realistic' even as clinton 2016 story count keeps rising many democrats both inside and outside clinton world agree that, because of who she is, she doesn't need to be the first one out of the gate to announce her 2016 intentions. ""there is definitely no rush for hillary to decide about 2016,"" said democratic strategist and cnn contributor paul begala. ""as someone who wants her to run, i still understand that she has lots of time. no one should try to rush hillary on this. she has earned the right to advance her mission in the foundation. hillary has earned the unique status she has today, and there is no need for her to be pressured into diving back into the political swamp."" thanks to her name recognition, the former first lady, senator from new york and secretary of state is the overwhelming frontrunner in early 2016 surveys. in the most recent survey, conducted earlier this month by cnn/orc international, nearly two-thirds of democrats and independents who lean toward that party said they were likely to back clinton as their presidential nominee. vice president joe biden came in a distant second, at 10%, with freshman sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts at 7%, new york gov. andrew cuomo at 6%, and maryland gov. martin o'malley at 2%. the cnn survey was in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated clinton was far ahead of all the other possible democratic contenders. begala, who was a senior political adviser to president bill clinton, said hillary clinton's ""time horizon and the whole rest of the party's time horizon are very, very different,"" adding that ""anybody else has got to start to lay the groundwork"" much earlier than clinton."" ""hillary has more time than anyone else. and that's why her friends, and i'm one of them, are saying she can take her time. she doesn't need to build name identification. she doesn't even need to build a roster of donors."" translation: don't expect to see clinton make a stop in iowa, new hampshire, or south carolina anytime soon, as some of the other potential 2016ers, such as o'malley and even biden, have already made. clinton already has a superpac named ""ready for hillary"" actively raising money in support of a possible 2016 bid. and the political action committee that begala advises, ""priorities usa,"" which was formed in 2011 to back president barack obama's 2012 re-election campaign and spent millions on tv ads critical of mitt romney, could play a similar role for clinton should she run again. asked if there is a concern that if clinton waits too long, some big name donors and influential democratic politicians could stray to other 2016 candidates, begala said such a scenario is ""not a concern at all."" not all democrats agree. ""she is the prohibitive favorite, but the dynamics of the race change the longer someone waits. so the question is how long can she wait,"" said chris kofinis, a democratic strategist and a veteran of the wesley clark 2004 and john edwards 2008 presidential campaigns. ""if she gets in early, she sucks up the oxygen, the money, and the grassroots. she could basically kill the field."" palin: hillary clinton ill-suited to be president when it comes to polling, clinton's standing now compares to her situation the first time she ran for president, when she was the democratic favorite in the early years of the 2008 presidential cycle. she was the front-runner in cnn polling from mid-2005 through 2006, prior to her january 2007 announcement that she was forming an exploratory committee, which formally kicked off her presidential fundraising and campaigning. by then, sens. barack obama of illinois and chris dodd of connecticut, biden, former sen. john edwards of north carolina, and gov. bill richardson of new mexico had all jumped in. pelosi: hillary clinton more ready for white house than husband, obama were clinton and obama eventually went on to battle each other in a historic primary season, which ended with clinton ending her bid for the nomination in june 2008, at the conclusion of the primary calendar. ben labolt, a veteran of three presidential campaigns, suggests there may be a middle ground for clinton. ""secretary clinton faces a paradoxical choice: if she announces that she's re-entering the political fray, scrutiny on her would be heightened exponentially. yet even without an announcement, the press and her potential opponents are already treating her like she is running,"" said labolt, who served as a deputy press secretary for obama's 2008 campaign and national press secretary for the 2012 re-election campaign. ""the solution might be to ensure trusted advisers are working from the outside to manage rapid response, cultivate donors and study her prospective competitors' records to lay the groundwork for a run for as long as possible without jumping two feet in."" clinton herself downplays any imminent announcement, saying such speculation isn't good for the country. ""it's like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there,"" clinton said. ""and you want to talk to them about something that's really important; in fact, maybe you came to the party to talk to that particular person, and they just want to know what's next. i feel like that's our political process right now. i just don't think it is good.""",hillary clinton tells an interviewer that she's wrestling with a 2016 decision

"atlanta (cnn)whitney houston's daughter, bobbi kristina brown, is on a ventilator and in intensive care, after she was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub full of water, a source close to the family said. brown, 21, was placed in a medically induced coma and the status of her brain function won't be known until the sedatives are reduced, the source told cnn. ""it is going to be a waiting game,"" said the source. brown ""was not breathing"" when a man identified as her husband found her saturday morning inside her townhouse in the atlanta suburb of roswell, georgia. he called 911 and performed cpr until public safety officers arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman lisa holland. the spokeswoman said when brown was found, she was ""unresponsive, meaning not breathing, no heartbeat."" in scanner traffic, emergency services could be heard describing an ""echo-level response"" -- urgent and life threatening -- with ""possible cardiac arrest."" ""twenty-one-year-old female in the bathtub, facedown. pd's (police department's) en route."" brown was taken to a local hospital, where ""she is still alive and breathing. other than that, i don't know her condition,"" holland said saturday. nobody knows what caused brown's unresponsiveness, holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. she said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. police had been to the residence recently. somebody reported a fight there january 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, holland said. the police spokeswoman noted one oddity in the case: ""her mother died in the very same manner."" three years ago, houston was found dead in a bathtub at the beverly hilton on february 11, hours before she was to attend a pre-grammys bash. an autopsy later revealed that she'd drowned facedown in ""extremely hot water"" about 12 inches deep. the los angeles county coroner ruled it an accidental drowning with the ""effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use"" as contributing factors. brown is her only child.

""she loves hard,"" burrell said then of bobbi kristina. ""she's going to be ok, and we're going to see to it."" brown appeared on episodes of lifetime's brief reality show ""the houstons: on our own,"" which followed her life after houston's death. one of that reality show's storylines revolved around brown's relationship with nick gordon, who lived with houston and her daughter from the age of 12. months later, brown reportedly got engaged to gordon. and in january 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, presumably belonging to her and gordon, along with the words, #happilymarried• so#inlove.""

"-- when jon huntsman announced his campaign for president last summer, he received the type of media attention that presumed he would be an immediate and formidable challenger for the republican nomination. unlike other early casualties like herman cain and michele bachmann, huntsman did not self-destruct. there was no spectacular immolation or flameout that rocked the political world, nor had there been the type of stratospheric rise that marked cain and bachmann's campaigns. instead, there was just a long, steady flatline, with maybe the slightest sign of a heartbeat in the days before the new hampshire primary, but far too little and too late to make any difference. it was only in the superheated world of cable tv and online media that his withdrawal received more than a moment's notice. so what went wrong for a candidate who entered the race with a biography and a bank account that seemed to presume a major impact on the primary campaign? the conventional wisdom is that huntsman was unnecessarily confrontational toward conservatives early in his campaign, the republican who didn't seem to want to be a republican. for a candidate with such strong conservative credentials on almost every issue, the strategy didn't make sense. but that combative approach, combined with his time in the obama administration, allowed him to be typecast by a lot of gop voters from the outset and he never recovered. the other, bigger problem he faced was his lack of presence in the candidate debates. the debates this year, for better or worse, became the stage on which the contenders defined themselves for the voters in the early primary states. they provided campaign-changing moments for cain, rick perry, newt gingrich and others. but huntsman just faded into the background and was never able to use them as a platform from which he could draw attention to his candidacy. exacerbating his irrelevance was huntsman's decision to skip the iowa caucuses, condemning him to be overlooked in most daily campaign coverage. john mccain made the same decision 12 years earlier and used the time to build a new hampshire campaign that catapulted him to victory in that state's primary. but mccain's biography as a vietnam pow drew public attention in a way that huntsman's time as ambassador to china could never duplicate. worse, huntsman never developed a policy proposal that created a rationale for an insurgent candidacy the way mccain's embrace of campaign finance reform did for him that year. it's not that huntsman made any major errors in his campaign. he was perfectly presentable and mostly polite, the perfect lodger and the perfect guest. for most of the campaign, though, jon huntsman was simply the man who wasn't there. join cnn opinion on facebook and follow updates on twitter the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dan schnur",jon huntsman drops out of gop race after weak performance in new hampshire
"-- the state department's inspector general's office is criticizing both a private contractor and u.s. government officials for ""considerable construction deficiencies"" in the new u.s. embassy in iraq. in a report released thursday, acting inspector general harold w. geisel lists incomplete design work, safety questions and maintenance problems that he says may continue for years. the report recommends that the state department try to get a $132 million refund from the major construction contractor, first kuwaiti trading and contracting. the embassy -- the largest such u.s. facility in the world -- ended up costing more than $700 million, with first kuwaiti receiving more than $470 million. the compound includes working space for more than 1,000 people and housing for several hundred. it officially opened in january. a special office set up by the state department to oversee the construction of the baghdad embassy failed to carry out its administrative responsibilities or enforce the provisions of the contract, the report says. the state department says in the report that procedures for future projects will be different. one problem cited by the inspector general's office is inadequate emergency ""safe areas"" inside the embassy compound. it suggests the state department try to recover $4.6 million ""to repair safe areas, which are vital to protecting staff in emergency situations but which were not constructed according to contract specifications."" ""we found that although the construction ... [of the embassy] in a war zone in 34 months was a significant accomplishment, considerable construction deficiencies remained because designs for the facilities had not been completed and approved and quality control and commissioning procedures were inadequate,"" the report says.

""we have proven success. nobody imagined that we would succeed in defeating terrorism and al qaeda,"" al-maliki said. also monday, nato announced it is withdrawing training forces from iraq by december 31. a nato statement said ""robust negotiations"" on extending the nato training mission failed to reach agreement. the unresolved issue was granting foreign forces immunity from local prosecution, officials said. the same issue stymied earlier talks between the obama administration and al-maliki's government about the possibility of some u.s. training forces staying longer than the deadline for withdrawal set in an agreement dating back to the bush administration. both obama and al-maliki have political reasons for ending the u.s. military presence. obama pledged during his 2008 campaign to bring u.s. troops home from iraq, while al-maliki faces internal opposition to the foreign military presence. more than 4,400 u.s. troops were killed and thousands more were wounded in the war that began in 2003. iraqi casualties are estimated to exceed 100,000. some u.s. conservatives oppose the end of the iraq operation, arguing that the withdrawal of american forces leaves iraq vulnerable to political instability from internal forces and neighbors such as iran. ""domestic political considerations in each country have been allowed to trump our common security interests,"" sen. john mccain, r-arizona, said in a statement. "" all of the progress that both iraqis and americans have made, at such painful and substantial cost, has now been put at greater risk. i hope i am wrong, but i fear i am not. it did not have to be this way, and the fact that it is has everything to do with a failure of vision, commitment and leadership both in washington and baghdad."" as of sunday, 6,000 u.s. troops and four u.s. military bases remained in iraq, according to col. barry johnson, spokesman for the united states forces in iraq. the four bases are: • kalsu in iskandariya, about 20 miles south of baghdad • echo in diwaniya, about 110 miles south of baghdad • adder near nasiriya, about 200 miles southeast of baghdad • basra in basra, about 340 miles southeast of baghdad iraq faces many challenges as u.s. troops pull out, ranging from human rights issues to oil deals to national stability. obama said monday that the united states wants to help iraq ""ramp up oil production"" and is ""helping to encourage international investments in that sector."" he also said some military-to-military ties will continue, similar to u.s. links with some other countries, and there ""may be occasion for joint exercises."" the u.s. goal ""is a sovereign iraq that can protect its borders, protect its airspace, protect its people,"" obama said. for his part, al-maliki told reporters he requested military hardware from obama, including the f-16s to help rebuild the air force. ""definitely we have raised the issue of the iraqi need for weapons for area protection, naval and ground protection,"" al-maliki said. ""we have a lot of weapons, american weapons, and it requires trainers. and we received promises for cooperation from his excellency, the president, for some weapons that iraq is asking for, especially those related to its protection of its airspace."" some analysts fear that violence could spike in iraq as groups struggle over power in the wake of the u.s. troop withdrawal, and that the decreased u.s. presence could allow iran to increase its influence. meghan o'sullivan, a bush administration deputy national security adviser for iraq and afghanistan from 2004 to 2007, wrote that there is ""reason to worry"" in a recent analysis for foreign affairs posted on cnn's global public square blog. ""the foundations of the iraqi state remain shallow. divisions within iraq's ruling elite run deep,"" wrote o'sullivan, now a professor at the john f. kennedy school of government at harvard university. ""a continued u.s. military presence would not have guaranteed peace and prosperity, but its removal increases the risks of failure in iraq by eliminating the psychological backstop to a still delicate political system and by kicking open the door more widely to foreign interference."" american officials have insisted the drastic pullback of troops does not mean an end to the u.s. government's presence in iraq. hundreds of nonmilitary u.s. personnel will remain in iraq, including 1,700 diplomats, law enforcement officers and economic, agriculture and other professionals and experts, according to the state department. in addition, 5,000 security contractors will protect u.s. diplomats and another 4,500 contractors will serve other roles, such as helping provide food and medical services, until they can be done locally. future u.s. involvement in training for iraqi troops is also a possibility, u.s. officials have said. officials and analysts have said the impact of the u.s. presence will echo for years to come. ""iraqis, americans and the world ultimately will judge us far more on the basis of what will happen than what has happened,"" ryan crocker, then-u.s. ambassador to iraq, said in 2008 congressional testimony. ""in the end, how we leave and what we leave behind will be more important than how we came."" cnn's ingrid formanek and catherine shoichet contributed to this report.",new: the united states intends to sell 18 more f-16 fighter jets to iraq

"-- four months ago raya al habsi didn't know how to swim and was a complete sailing novice. yet al habsi is set to become one of the first professional women sailors in the sultanate of oman. al habsi is one of 30 women being trained as part of a scheme to create a new generation of female sailors and boost the country's olympic chances. the women were chosen in july to take part in the program --which started in october-- and will see them qualify as sailing instructors after an intensive six-month training course. for al habsi, it has been a life-changing event. ""i didn't know anything about sailing, just what i have watched on tv,"" she says. ""i was a complete beginner."" ""what i enjoy the most is how every single day we learn something new. it is a breath of fresh air... oman is such a great place to sail. and i absolutely love racing with my colleagues."" an insight into the extreme series before winning a place on the programme, al habsi had recently graduated from a degree in business management. but she was looking for a change and for a career that was unique. she says she found that in the oman sail program for women. ""life has changed a lot since i joined,"" says al habsi. ""we start the day laughing and singing and having lots of fun in the bus on our way to sailing school. ""our daily work schedule differs on a weekly basis. (it) includes theory and practical lessons that help the development of our personal and professional skills."" it's a pioneering project in oman, where women have only been able to work since the mid-1990s. women are now being encouraged by the country's ruler, sultan qaboos bin said, to engage in a range of areas, such as politics and now sailing. since launching three years ago, oman sail has taken nearly 6,000 omani children sailing, over half of whom have been girls. young women were recruited into its sailing centers at mussanah and marina bandar al rowdha in july, where they underwent training. al habsi says, ""we continue the day in developing our fitness levels by swimming, kayaking and, of course, sailing. sometimes i feel like i'm on a trip with my colleagues. i do not feel tired or bored after a long day of work."" ""we have (been) allowed a golden opportunity for women to go into this field of sailing,"" she says. ""a new challenging field has been introduced for women to take upon the challenge of sailing and represent their country in international venues."" double olympic sailing gold medalist and cnn mainsail host shirley robertson is a mentor on the program. ""when i first went to the marina in july some of these girls didn't know how to swim. ""some had only seen the sea a few times in their lives. we saw girls sail before but it was hard to retain them in the sport as they grew older because there were no women instructors."" considering that many of these women had little experience prior to starting the program, the experience has not been without trials. robertson adds, ""the journey is amazing. they don't just have to learn to sail. some have to learn to swim first. at the beginning their fitness levels were low and after the first few weeks they were wrecked... but these girls are thirsty for knowledge."" robertson explains that is was an ambitious project that intrigued her from the beginning but she was unsure at first if the organizers would be able to pull it off. ""oman sail had to build a pathway and the building blocks had to be laid down right... but they got stuck in. the project has been blessed by the sultan and oman sail has a good reputation in the country so family members feel more comfortable allowing girls to being involved."" the fact that the project has received a royal blessing is extremely important in the sultanate of oman. qaboos bin said is widely recognized as a reformer in a region where women's rights have traditionally been overlooked. since coming to power, he has pushed for gender equality in many sectors including politics and education. al habsi points out, ""his majesty sultan qaboos bin said has always emphasized on giving opportunities for omani women to work in all possible fields shoulder-to-shoulder with their male colleagues."" robertson adds, ""things in oman are changing. the sultan embraces women. there's equal education and an omani women's day which was an initiative of the sultan."" and while the government has been pushing for an integration of genders, families also need to agree with the project or it is doomed to fail. the family unit is an important institution of many nations like oman. robertson says, ""families are brave to have the love, support and trust to let the women do this. if it's going to work, the whole family has to buy in, especially the men. jill reilly contributed to this report",oman has launched a women's sailing program to create a new generation of female sailors
"-- more than half a century of hostility between the united states and cuba has done nothing to diminish the island's love of america's national pastime. so it came as no surprise wednesday when major league baseball tweeted that it was ""closely monitoring"" president barack obama's historic plans to normalize diplomatic relations with cuba and ease economic restrictions on the nation. ""while there are not sufficient details to make a realistic evaluation, we will continue to track this significant issue, and we will keep our clubs informed if this different direction may impact the manner in which they conduct business on issues related to cuba,"" mlb said in the statement. but observers say don't expect an immediate influx of cuban talent in the big leagues. not yet, at least. when the 2014 season opened, 19 players born in cuba were listed on mlb rosters. the island nation was third after the dominican republic with 83 players born there and venezuela with 59. for cuba, the 19 players was a record high and surpassed the record set in 2013 with 15 players. ""year after year, an ideological and economic barrier hardened between our two countries,"" obama told the nation. ""meanwhile, the cuban exile community in the united states made enormous contributions to our country, in politics, in business, culture and sports."" take recent arrival jose abreu, the 27-year-old cienfuegos-born first baseman for the chicago white sox. abreu was voted the american league rookie of the year this season, batting .317 with 36 home runs, 107 rbi and .581 slugging percentage. and there's yoenis cespedes, 29, the shotgun-armed leftfielder with the detroit tigers, who batted .260 with 22 homers and 100 rbi; los angeles dodgers rightfielder yasiel puig, 24, who hit .296 with 16 home runs and 69 rbi; and cincinnati reds closer aroldis chapman, 26, who posted 36 saves with 106 strikeouts, a 2.00 era and brushed back batters with 100-mph fastballs. ""this could absolutely have an impact on the game,"" doug eldridge, managing partner and sports agent at the dle agency, said of the change in cuba policy. ""there is such a strong hispanic presence in the mlb and some of the biggest stars in today's game are cuban."" bells ring in havana, anger erupts in miami for decades, cuban players who dreamed of playing in mlb had to defect from the island. some left their squads while traveling abroad with a national team, but others risked their lives by depending on smugglers to get them out. many settled in third countries to avoid the mlb amateur draft and make the most money as free agents. puig's harrowing escape -- which included hiking through crocodile-infested waters and being held captive by a mexican trafficking ring that threatened to cut off his arm -- was chronicled by espn the magazine and los angeles magazine. a significant shift in u.s. policy could eliminate such perils. ""to say it's a dangerous and shady process is probably an understatement,"" eldrige said. ""this could be a more diplomatic approach to becoming a free agent in mlb."" but it's unlikely that cuba will allow mlb teams to do what the league has long done in the dominican republic, where team-sponsored baseball academies recruit and groom prospects from an early age. for a long time, cuba has considered players who defected traitors. the government is very proud and protective of the homegrown talent it identifies at an early age in state-run baseball academies. some observers believe cuba is more likely to adopt a system similar to japan, where mlb teams pay the player's team for the right to negotiate and sign him. in this case, the player's team would be the cuban government. that way, the island keeps control of players and pumps a portion of their contracts into cuba's faltering economy. 9 questions you were embarrassed to ask about the cuban embargo cuba recently started to allow baseball stars to sign with japanese baseball teams. the government has been in talks with mexican teams about similar arrangements. the players' contracts and salaries are tightly controlled by the cuban state. ""the athletes that are able to leave the country now are finished products,"" said robert boland, a professor of sports management at new york university. ""they create bidding wars among the teams. if players were free to move and play, we will probably see more ... coming into the market."" ben badler, a writer for baseball america, tweeted: ""cuba's already leasing players to japan, tried with mexico. small change compared to what they would making selling stars to mlb teams."" but arrangements such as those with japan are unlikely as long as the decades-old u.s. economic embargo against cuba remains in place. ted henken, a cuba expert at new york's baruch college, said the apparent thawing of relations increases the prospects for cuban talent in the big leagues, ""but a lot more must change both in cuba and the u.s. for that to happen."" cnn's kathryn vasel contributed to this report.","mlb is ""closely monitoring"" washington's plans to normalize diplomatic relations with havana"
"-- there's a trillion dollar virus that is spreading throughout silicon valley right now. it's called social networking. this virus, a relentless kind of digital blob, feeds on our most intimate data. the bigger a social network becomes, the greedier it becomes for our data and the more it invades our lives, voraciously feeding off our friendships and destroying our privacy. all the recent public hysteria about this virus has been concentrated on a social networking start-up called path which is accused of surreptitiously copying the address books of its iphone users through its mobile app. twitter, too, has been accused of this same invasion of our privacy, copying the addresses that we store in our smartphones with neither our permission nor knowledge. but this virus goes beyond path, beyond twitter, beyond even facebook. it's a virus that may be built into the very heart, the operating system of the trillion dollar social networking industry. silicon valley has even invented a law to explain this endemic virus. metcalfe's law, named after the ethernet inventor bob metcalfe, states that ""the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system."" or, more simply, networks are worth more and more the bigger they get. social networks have the same biology as viruses. if they don't radically replicate themselves, they die. and the most successful and valuable social networks -- twitter, google+, foursquare, pinterest, instagram, tumblr and linkedin --- are those which grow their membership the quickest. helping us ""discover"" friends has, thus, become the crack cocaine of every online social network. the bigger our personal network, the more personal data we give out, the more people with whom we connect, the more valuable the network. it's not surprising, therefore, that path and twitter and, it is rumored, almost all of today's dominant social networks, have been ""borrowing"" our address books for years through their mobile apps. it's what path ceo dave morin, in a stunning defense of his data grab, described as ""industry best practice"". but silicon valley's dirty secret now being exposed by insiders such as the legendary blogger dave winer and in damning new books like lori andrews' ""i know who you are and i saw what you did"". like morin, i strongly suspect that the practice is endemic. take, for example, linkedin, one of the most reputable social networks, whose ipo last may was, at the time, the largest since the google ipo. i'm on linkedin and have always been curious about the network's ""people you may know"" section, a feature that has always appeared to be eerily serendipitous. so yesterday i ran a test. among the first 50 people that linkedin suggested i might know included my best english friend from childhood, the real estate broker who sold me a house in alabama, a californian friend and neighbor, my former silicon valley boss and the new york editor of my first book. the uncannily accurate list crossed continents, lives, cultures and epochs. and i really did know 90% of the linkedin list. creepy, eh? ""question: how is linkedin's suggestion list so uncannily accurate? how does it know my most intimate friends?"" i posted on twitter. linkedin spokeswoman krista canfield had this response via email: ""as with many companies that rely on algorithms to deliver relevant suggestions to its members, we don¹t share too many details for obvious reasons. what i can tell you is that we use a variety of data points -- including but not limited to mutual connections and profile views, among others -- to make relevant suggestions. ""i also want to note that any data that we use is completely consistent with our privacy policy."" another reply came from dj patil, a former chief scientist at linkedin, who is now a data scientist at venture capital firm greylock ventures. ""one of the things we look for in every data scientist is an 11 out of 10 in esp,"" he tweeted. google's former ceo, eric schmidt said that he hoped his search engine would one day know us better than we know ourselves. and it seems that linkedin's goal is to know our own network more intimately that we ourselves do. but the problem, of course, is that most of us don't want our social networks to have 11 out of 10 in esp. that's why the path controversy has elicited such intense debate in silicon valley. and that's why path ceo morin, after being confronted by hundreds on irate users including the actress alyssa milano, made a full public apology for his actions. one of the shrewdest commentators on this virus is nick bilton, the new york times' san francisco based technology columnist and blogger. ""so many apologies, so much data mining,"" he wrote at the weekend in a scathing critique of silicon valley's dismissal of privacy. so i emailed bilton and asked him how we should confront this seemingly unstoppable invasion of our privacy through the stealing of our data. his response was typically down-to-earth. ""as users of these sites and apps, we have no idea the type of information we are trading for 'free' access,"" he wrote. ""it's one thing for a service to tell me that it plans to read my e-mails, sift through my address book, or look in my underwear drawer — then it is my responsibility to decide if i want to use the service — but it's entirely different for these company's to do so at will. ""sure, i want linkedin, facebook and other services to offer a better experience, but i want to know what they are doing with my personal information, this way, i can choose to enter with caution, knowing the potential consequences, or try to find an alternative service that is more transparent."" bilton is, of course, right. it's not enough for sophisticated data scientists like dj patil to boast about the intelligence of their social algorithms. what we need is a clear explanation of how a network like linkedin has such uncannily accurate knowledge of so many of our most intimate friendships. this currently doesn't exist. linkedin's user agreement , for example, is almost 6,500 words and users would need an advanced law degree to make head or tail of it. equally important, bilton argues, is the need to always remind ourselves of the ""information"" that we are trading for ""free"" access on the network. this is a critically important point. social networks like facebook, twitter and path, he reminds us, are free services in which we are actually the product that these businesses are selling to advertisers. the only way to control the trillion dollar virus spreading through silicon valley is by standing up to it. either dave morin wins or we do. it is us or them. so, as nick bilton says, we need to demand to know what path and the rest of silicon valley is doing with our personal data. if we don't do this, then the digital blob will consume all this data and our privacy really will have become an artifact of history. • follow @ajkeen on twitter the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of andrew keen",digital commentator andrew keen says social networking is a virus that feeds on intimate data
"-- nancy pelosi says there are 14 million reasons why chuck schumer is wrong. in an intraparty feud about political strategy, the house minority leader on tuesday called out the no. 3 senate democratic leader for saying that it was a mistake for democrats to focus on passing health care reform in 2010. ""after passing the stimulus, democrats should have continued to propose middle class-oriented programs and built on the partial success of the stimulus, but unfortunately democrats blew the opportunity the american people gave them,"" schumer said in a remarks focused on political messaging heading into 2016 at the national press club. new york's schumer added, ""we took their mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem -- health care reform."" when asked whether she agreed with schumer's assessment, california's pelosi didn't mince words in a written statement provided to cnn. ""we come here to do a job, not keep a job. there are more than 14 million reasons why that's wrong,"" pelosi said. the 14 million figure pelosi cites references those americans who now have health care coverage since the law was enacted. it adds together those who have signed up through health care exchanges, those allowed to say on their parent's health care plans through age 26 and those getting coverage through the expansion of the medicaid program. pelosi's office also maintained that the affordable care act has had a positive economic effect in terms of bending the cost curve over the long term. they also took issue with the notion that the house, under pelosi's speakership, wasn't focused on the economy after obama was elected. an aide noted that the house passed a jobs bill the democratic-led senate did not take up, and the original version of the stimulus bill the house passed was larger than the final version the senate approved. later tuesday, an white house official also weighed in. as did a couple of former white house officials. an aide to schumer said the new york democrat has hinted at this concern in the past. schumer supported the affordable care act, but from a political timing standpoint, he thought the party could have done other things before turning to health care. but in moving to stake out the party's message going forward, schumer put himself at odds with pelosi, who was one of the fiercest champions of passing the legislation through the house in 2010. the controversial bill passed without a single republican vote, and the house gop filed a lawsuit last week to challenge president barack obama's authority to make changes to the law. cnn's ted barrett contributed to this report",sen. chuck schumer of new york has questioned democrats' timing in passing health reform
"-- it was a wonderful life. that's how edith windsor describes her partnership with thea clara spyer. theirs was not a fleeting romance -- the women were together 42 years sharing ups and downs, laughs and tears. they also shared what they'd earned together, including from windsor's job as a programmer with ibm and spyer's work as a psychologist. ""we were mildly affluent and extremely happy,"" windsor said. ""we were like most couples."" but even after they married in 2007 in toronto, some 40 years into their courtship, the two women were not ""like most couples"" in the eyes of the state of new york, where they lived, nor in the eyes of the u.s. government, which under the defense of marriage act mandates that a spouse, as legally defined, must be a person of the opposite sex. this fact hit windsor hard in 2009, while in a hospital after suffering a heart attack a month after spyer's death. as she recovered and mourned, windsor realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes -- $363,053 more than was warranted, she later claimed in court -- because spyer was, in legal terms, little more than a friend. ""it was incredible indignation,"" windsor recalled feeling. ""just the numbers were so cruel."" this anger gave way to action. why, she and her lawyers argued, should her relationship with spyer be any different when it came to rights, taxes and more than a heterosexual couple? why should windsor have to pay, literally, for losing her soulmate -- even though, by 2009, new york courts had recognized that ""foreign same-sex marriages"" should be recognized in the state as valid? in october, windsor, now 83, got an answer in the form of a ruling opinion from the 2nd u.s. circuit court of appeals. that court found, in her favor, that the defense of marriage act violates the constitution's equal protection clause and thus she shouldn't have had to pay an inheritance tax after her partner's death. this follows a similar ruling, in may, from another federal appeals court in boston. federal appeals court strikes down defense of marriage act neither opinion settles the matter for good. that is expected to happen next year when the supreme court will weigh the constitutionality of the defense of marriage act through the prism of windsor and spyer's story. it is one of two cases related to same-sex marriage that the high court will consider, it announced friday. the other addresses california's proposition 8. even with those cases still to be decided, windsor said earlier this fall -- when the lower court decided in her favor, three years after spyer's death -- that she felt she could finally breathe and celebrate. it was a day she relished, and one she didn't entirely expect after all her heartache. ""what i'm feeling is elated,"" windsor said. ""did i ever think it could come to be, altogether? ... not a chance in hell."" instant chemistry in greenwich village born in philadelphia in 1929, on the eve of the great depression, windsor graduated from temple university and earned a master's degree, in 1957, from new york university, according to a fall 2011 story in the latter school's alumni magazine. she had come to new york hoping for a fresh start after a brief marriage, according to the report. and professionally, she found it -- working for nyu's math department and soon entering data into its univac, one of a few dozen of the huge commercial computers then in operation. her knack for programming eventually helped her land a job, and to excel, at ibm. but something was missing in her life, personally. or, as windsor put it more succinctly, ""i suddenly couldn't take it anymore."" in the documentary ""edie and thea: a very long engagement,"" she recalled pleading with an old friend to take her ""where the lesbians go."" and so windsor spent one friday night at portofino, a restaurant in new york's greenwich village. ""somebody brought thea over and introduced her. and we ended up dancing,"" she recalled. ""and we immediately just fit,"" added spyer, on the documentary. timeline: same-sex marriage after reuniting two years later, according to their new york times' wedding announcement, their connection proved deep and lasting. in 1967, spyer proposed marriage with a round diamond pin. a year later, they purchased a house together in southampton, according to the nyu alumni magazine story. yet while the gay rights' movement took off after the 1969 stonewall riots, which occurred while windsor and spyer were vacationing in italy, an actual marriage -- a legal union -- seemed out of the question. marriage, at last, and then heartache regardless, their love remained strong. on the documentary, filmed around 2007, spyer said, ""each one of us, in fact, looks different from how we looked when we met. but if i look at edie now, she looks exactly the same to me. exactly the same."" windsor had halted her new career as a gay rights activist to help care for her partner, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. and it was after getting a ""bad prognosis (that) i had another year to live and that was it"" that spyer proposed again. ""and i said yes,"" windsor recalled. ""she said, 'so do i.' "" video shows spyer being pushed through the airport in her wheelchair. it was from that seat -- on may 22, 2007, at toronto's sheraton gateway hotel -- that she gave her vows to make their marriage official in canada. ""i, thea spyer, choose you, edith windsor, to be my lawful, wedded spouse,"" she said. ""for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part."" having happily gone four decades without, windsor soon realized how much the marriage meant to her. it made her and spyer's love legitimate and all the more real. ""it's different because somewhere you're a hidden person, and suddenly you're a citizen of the world,"" she said in october. but what happened as spyer's condition worsened, and after her death, proved a stark reminder they were not legally united in their own country. and the fact that new york legalized same-sex marriage in 2011 didn't mean that windsor, for example, would suddenly get back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in inheritance tax that she'd given to the government. that could happen, however, if the supreme court upholds the appeals court ruling. that is windsor's hope, as is that whether a committed couple is heterosexual or homosexual becomes irrelevant within the next decade. in the meantime, windsor said she's proud to fight for something bigger than herself and the legitimacy of her union with spyer. she hopes, through her struggle, to help make it so gay teenagers can ""fall in love knowing there's a future,"" that children of gay couples won't feel the need to explain their families, and that homophobia becomes a thing of the past.

"-- huge crowds assembled in pyongyang on thursday at a national memorial service for the north korean leader kim jong il, the second day of state-orchestrated ceremonies to mourn the dictator who died earlier this month. the authoritarian regime used a mixture of somber music, hyperbolic speeches, booming artillery fire and blaring horns to honor the man who oversaw 17 years of despotic rule in the secretive nation. the ceremony took place a day after a funeral procession for kim spent three hours winding through the snow-laden streets of pyongyang lined with thousands of wailing mourners. once again, the regime placed kim jong un, the son and chosen successor of kim jong il, at the center of proceedings, proclaiming him the ""supreme leader"" of north korea -- a fresh indication that the leadership transition is progressing smoothly. the footage broadcast thursday by north korean state television showed thick rectangular blocks of people gathered in the snowy expanse of kim il sung square -- named after kim jong il's father, the founder of north korea. kim jong un and other senior members of the regime stood solemnly on a viewing platform overlooking the square. during the ceremony, a string of top officials took to the microphone to praise kim jong il's life and reinforce kim jong un's leadership credentials. ""kim jong un is the supreme leader who has inherited kim jong il's beliefs, leadership, courage and guts,"" said kim yong nam, the president of the north korean parliament. read about the funeral for kim jong il ""kim jong il's great achievements will shine forever,"" said kim ki nam, a senior official in the powerful worker's party. ""following our party's supreme leader, kim jong un, we are converting our sadness to courage and we will achieve great things."" under kim jong il, the country suffered a devastating famine even as it built up its million-strong army, expanded its arsenal of ballistic missiles and became the world's eighth declared nuclear power. he died on december 17, reportedly from a heart attack. news of his death, announced two days later, put the region on edge and set off speculation around the world about the country's stability and future direction. for the time being, kim jong un appears to be rallying support within the regime, despite his young age -- he is thought to be in his late 20s -- and relative inexperience. after the speeches thursday, a row of heavy guns fired off a salute. then, a cacophony of horns and sirens went off, drawing the service -- and the last day of official mourning -- to a close. cnn's tim schwartz contributed to this report.",artillery fire and blaring horns commemorate kim jong il's life
"(ew.com) -- critics everywhere have hailed ""bully"" as an important, engaging documentary. ew's owen gleiberman calls it ""sensitive and eye-opening""; the film has also earned a near-perfect 93 percent ""fresh"" rating from the reviews aggregated by rotten tomatoes. but in an article posted late last week, slate's emily bazelon alleged that some crucial parts of ""bully"" are ""utterly one-sided"" and ""factually questionable."" her piece focused on tyler long, one of the doc's featured subjects; when he was just 17, long took his own life, apparently because he was bullied by his classmates. but according to bazelon, that isn't the whole story. she wrote that tyler also suffered from adhd, bipolar disorder, and asperger's syndrome; additionally, his girlfriend broke up with him a few weeks before his suicide. it seems likely that these factors contributed to tyler's decision to commit suicide, bazelon wrote. she asserted that by not mentioning them -- and by possibly exaggerating the treatment tyler received in school â€” director lee hirsch and producer cynthia lowen oversimplified and distorted the facts to create a smoother narrative. lowen responded to the allegations with an exclusive statement to ew: ""due to its glaring inaccuracies, misinformation and lack of journalistic integrity -- the filmmakers of 'bully' would like to respond to emily bazelon's 'the problem with bully.' we are deeply disappointed by the author's neglect to gain a clear picture of tyler's bullying in the murray county school district, which is currently under investigation by the united states department of justice regarding allegations of ongoing bullying and harassment. bazelon suggests that tyler was not bullied in the days, weeks and months before his death. this is factually incorrect. there are literally hundreds of bullying events and incidents that have been testified to under oath by his fellow students. multiple students testified he was bullied on a ""daily basis,"" and the pleadings reflect constant bullying his junior year, including the very day he killed himself. bazelon erroneously cites tyler's prior health history and its significance to the case: he was never diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and asperger syndrome is not a recognized risk factor for suicide. that tyler was on the autism spectrum is never something the filmmakers have hidden, it is something we have discussed in many interviews and post-viewing q&a's. the fact that tyler was on the spectrum does not reduce the school system's responsibility to provide a safe learning environment. as filmmakers we felt that was the bottom line. for this very reason, we chose not to introduce his autism in the film. the filmmakers are dismayed by bazelon's failure to reach out to either the long family or their legal counsel, so that they may have had the opportunity to address the murray county school district's assertions."" when presented with lowen's statement, slate deputy editor julia turner responded with one of her own: ""emily bazelon's central concern about 'bully,' expressed in her review for slate, is that the movie presents a one-sided and incomplete version of the events leading up to the suicide of tyler long. the movie includes no mention of the mental health issues tyler faced, and it fails to note that the school district disputes the long family's account of the causal role bullying played his death. the school district's legal papers tell us that tyler was diagnosed with adhd, bipolar disorder, and asperger's when he was in sixth grade, and while the family's response brief objects to the bipolar diagnosis as ""immaterial,"" it does not factually challenge it. perhaps more important for this conversation, no one disputes that tyler was on the autism spectrum, and considerable research links asperger's and autism to an elevated risk of suicide. (more helpful information on that here.) emily has covered bullying for slate for a few years now. her reporting has taught her how complicated the issues around it can be, especially in the tragic cases when a student takes his or her own life. and her interviews with suicide prevention experts have taught her how important it is to avoid oversimplifying the facts, which can make suicide look romantic or appealing, especially to teen viewers. emily's review was not intended to endorse the school district's view; merely to point out that an alternative viewpoint exists, and that the movie had a responsibility to address it."" bully is currently showing in five theaters in new york and los angeles; twc plans to expand that number to up to 150 theaters in the next few weeks. see the full article at ew.com. click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. all rights reserved.","slate's emily bazelon alleged that some crucial parts of ""bully"" are ""utterly one-sided"""

"-- jen wang of short hills, new jersey, took her first sat when she was in sixth grade, long before she would start filling out college applications. wake forest university recently announced it would no longer require the sat for admissions. ""my family thought it was very important for me to do well on this test, and i basically obtained nearly every sat study guide out there by the time i was a junior in high school,"" she said. ""for christmas one year, i received an electronic device that allowed me to practice the sat's 'on-the-go.' "" after all that preparation, she ended up attending a school that has made the sat reasoning test, generally known as the sat, the most widely used college admissions exam in the united states, optional. her school, connecticut college, is one of a growing number of colleges and universities that are making the sat optional in the admissions process. in may, two highly selective schools -- smith college in massachusetts and wake forest university in north carolina -- decided to drop the sat and act, which some students take as an alternative to the sat, as requirements for admission. wake forest made the move as part of its efforts to increase socioeconomic, racial and ethnic diversity in the student body, said martha allman, director of admissions. research has shown that sat performance is linked with family income, and that the test by itself does not accurately predict success in college, she said. making the test optional ""removes the barrier for those students who had everything else,"" like scholastic achievement and extracurricular activities, but who ""maybe didn't do as well on a specific test,"" she said. smith college also cited the correlation between test scores and income as a motivation for making the exam optional, as well as a desire to take a more well-rounded view of applications. the changes at smith and wake forest take effect for applicants seeking to enroll in the fall of 2009. several colleges and universities went test-optional in the 1990s amid concern that the test was a barrier to equal opportunity for minorities, women and low-income students, said robert schaeffer, public education director for fairtest. some schools also dropped the test as a requirement with the explosion of test coaching, which gave upper-income kids an advantage. today, about 30 percent, or nearly 760 colleges and universities out of the approximately 2,500 accredited four-year institutions across america have made at least some standardized tests optional for some applicants, according to the nonprofit advocacy group fairtest. some of those schools, such as george mason university in virginia, still require the tests for prospective students who do not meet a particular gpa requirement in high school. but alana klein, spokesperson for the college board, which owns the sat, said this is not a trend. while the news media have focused on recent moves to make the test optional, schools have been doing this for decades, and sat test volumes are up 2 percent from last year, she said. the poor performance of some low-income and minority students has to do with their lack of access to quality education, which is a national problem, but does not relate to the test itself, klein said. the sat is a fair test for all students, she said, and any test question that shows bias is removed. ""not only is the sat a critical tool for success in college, but also in the workforce and in life,"" she said. at bowdoin college, which hasn't required the sat since 1969, the biggest benefit of the test-optional policy is the school's ""unusually supportive community"" where students don't compare scores, said william shain, dean of admissions and financial aid. but at this small liberal arts college in maine, which admitted about 18 percent of applicants this year, more than 80 percent of applicants submit scores anyway, he said. one of the downsides of keeping standardized tests optional is that it's harder to evaluate a large pool of candidates who all have high gpas, he said. richard atkinson, former president of the university of california, recommended in 2001 that the school system no longer require the sat reasoning test for admission. he cited the concerns of african-americans and hispanics that these groups tend to perform worse on the exam than students of other ethnicities. ""the real basis of their concern, however, is that they have no way of knowing what the sat measures and, therefore, have no basis for assessing its fairness or helping their children acquire the skills to do better,"" atkinson said in 2001. the university of california system still requires the test today. several other schools dropped the test requirement for admissions after the revised sat came out in 2005, after seeing that the new version did not address concerns about access and poor predictive value, fairtest's schaeffer said. since spring 2005, 34 colleges and universities have made standardized testing optional for all applicants, according to fairtest. four others made the requirement optional for students with a lower gpa, fairtest's data showed. about 25 percent of liberal arts colleges have made a move in the test-optional direction, said jack maguire, chairman and founder of maguire associates. his consulting firm has advised certain colleges to become test-optional. ""i do think it improves a school's image,"" he said. ""it shows what's important to schools, if they're really interested in increasing diversity."" wang, who just finished her freshman year at connecticut college, said she is torn on the sat debate -- the test sharpened her vocabulary and test-taking skills, but preparation took up a lot of time that could have been spent doing other things. ""applicants may take too much time on prepping for this test and their time can be better spent dedicating themselves to other activities that could show colleges what the applicants really find meaningful in their lives,"" she said.",smith college and wake forest university no longer require the sat for admissions

"washington (cnn) -- the servers hosting the web sites of the house of representatives and its members have been overwhelmed with millions of e-mails in the past few days, forcing administrators to implement the ""digital version of a traffic cop"" to handle the overload. servers hosting web sites of the house of representatives have been flooded with millions of e-mails in recent days. ""this is unprecedented,"" said jeff ventura, communications director for the house's chief administrator. the tidal waves of e-mails and page views began after negotiators announced sunday that a deal had been reached on legislation to enact a $700 billion bailout of the country's financial system. in making the announcement, legislators said the public could view the agreement at financialservices.house.gov. ""in a short period of time, lots of web users were rushing to the digital doorway to get a copy of this thing,"" ventura told cnn in a phone interview. as millions of people tried to look at the details of the bailout plan, the house.gov system became overwhelmed and many people saw notices on their computer screens saying ""this page does not appear."" ireport.com: do you support a bailout? ventura compared the situation to the ""old days, when you listened to a radio show and the 10th caller got a toaster. then everyone calls the same 1-800 number at the same time and all you got was a busy signal.""

"-- retired justice john paul stevens had harsh words for his former conservative colleagues wednesday, saying they have inconsistently applied the law two years after a sweeping ruling dealing with campaign finance reform. that controversial decision, known as citizens united, gave corporations -- individuals, unions, businesses and advocacy groups -- greater power to spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose federal election candidates. stevens issued a bitter dissent in that case, months before stepping down from the high court after 35 years on the bench. he said congress had long imposed reasonable limits on corporate spending as a way to curb the potentially corrupting influence by the wealthy, whose voices would be heard above those of others in the crowded political landscape. stevens, at an evening speech at the university of arkansas, said the five conservatives who gave corporations greater power in the name of free speech may now be rethinking, even regretting, their decision, based on related cases since that 2010 decision. in particular, he noted the citizens united decision, which struck down the mccain-feingold campaign finance reform law, said the first amendment ""generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker's identity."" the 92-year-old former justice said the court will soon have to confront the question of whether the ruling applies to the ability of foreign corporations, potentially even terror groups, to spend freely. he predicted the justices would decide it does not. ""the court must then explain its abandonment of, or at least qualify reliance upon, the proposition that the identity of the speaker is an impermissible basis for regulating campaign speech,"" he told the audience. ""it will be necessary to explain why the first amendment provides greater protection for some nonvoters than that of other nonvoters. he said american corporations, unlike individuals, were in that broad category of nonvoters. stevens predicted creating an exception for the foreign corporations ""will create a crack in the foundation of the citizens united majority"" led by the conservatives under chief justice john roberts. president obama, just days after the citizens united opinion, said in his state of the union address that it would ""open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limits in our elections."" justice samuel alito, named to the court by president bush in 2006, was in the audience at the time and famously mouthed the words ""not true"" to obama's remarks. but stevens said that while he has not talked with alito about it, the mouthed words indicated ""there will not be five votes"" to sustain a majority if and when the court confronts the foreign spending question. stevens also noted time and logic has borne out the president's warnings. the high court earlier this year upheld a lower court ruling preventing noncitizens from contributing to federal political candidates. that, said stevens, showed the justices clearly believe ""the identity of some speakers may provide a legally acceptable basis for restricting speech"" in election contributions. ""i think it likely when the court begins to spell out which categories of nonvoters should receive the same protections"" enjoyed by u.s. corporations, ""it will not only exclude terrorist organizations and foreign agents, but also all corporations owned or controlled by noncitizens, and possibly even those in which noncitizens have a substantial ownership interest."" stevens' pointed remarks come in the midst of a presidential campaign season that is already breaking records for spending by outside groups, many of them so-called super pacs now unencumbered by previous spending limits. the justice on tuesday received the presidential medal of freedom from obama in a white house ceremony. the president praised stevens for his independent, rigorous approach to the law, ""favoring a pragmatic solution over an ideological one."" critics of stevens said he had abandoned his earlier conservative leanings to become a liberal on the high court. in his retirement, stevens has been outspoken about his former colleagues, criticizing rulings issued before and after he left the court.",retired justice john paul stevens shares thoughts in university of arkansas speech

'shrek' takes charge at st.andrews the south african responded to the early setback by making 2007 his best year so far on the golf circuit, winning three titles on the sunshine tour including the telkcom pga championship. however, oosthuizen's stop-start career continued as he failed to play in a major after missing the cuts for the masters, the british open and the pga championship in 2009. but 2010 is without doubt his most successful and memorable year on and off the course to date. first, oosthuizen became a father after his wife nel-marie gave birth to their baby daughter jana. then in march he finally won his first european tour event at the open de andalucia in spain beating england's richard finch and peter whiteford of scotland, who were tied second by three strokes. a victory of sorts in america was next, as the south african won the par 3 contest at the 2010 masters in april, but he missed the cut in the tournament proper at augusta. he also missed the weekend action in the u.s. open at pebble beach so the signs were not promising as he traveled to the east coast of scotland for the third major of the season. having missed the cut at the british open in 2004, 2006 and 2009, few, if any, envisaged him collecting the trophy at the end of play on sunday. yet oosthuizen left paul casey, lee westwood and the world number one tiger woods in his wake, with his final round of one-under-par 71 giving him a 16-under total of 272 and his only major title so far.",louis oosthuizen stormed to his first major win at the british open at st. andrews

"" with a background running a nanny agency, guth knew she could help. in 2008, she started the nanny angel network, a nonprofit that provides free in-home childcare for mothers who have cancer. ""mothers who are diagnosed with cancer are caregivers who suddenly find themselves in need of care,"" said guth, 59. ""our program allows mothers the freedom to take a rest, because that's what they need the most to get better."" since 2008, her organization has helped more than 300 moms in and around toronto. 'nanny angels' to the rescue guth's program is staffed by a team of volunteers who have professional backgrounds in childcare. many of them are cancer survivors. nearly half of the moms they help are single parents. it's one of the many reasons she believes the organization is so important. ""when you're a single mom, your income is decreased, and you often can't afford childcare,"" guth said. it's a challenge shauna barnett knows all too well. a single mother to a 4-year-old son, barnett has battled stage 2 breast cancer since september. she underwent a double mastectomy and aggressive chemotherapy to treat her disease. ""if i'm having a bad day, sometimes i can't lift my head off the pillow,"" said barnett, 38.

""the main thing is to keep their minds off of the cancer and what is happening to mum. i feel like mary poppins."" barnett recently underwent her last round of chemo and says doctors have given her a positive prognosis. she is grateful to guth's program for making her cancer journey easier.

""cancer changes everything for you and for your entire family,"" she said. ""what we do won't take away their illness, but it will certainly make their journey a lot easier."" with her own cancer now in remission, guth considers herself lucky, and she plans to keep paying her good fortune forward to more moms in need.

"-- four people were killed and two were wounded when a so-called sticky bomb attached to a vehicle exploded wednesday evening in the ashhabi neighborhood of eastern falluja, local police told cnn. the fatalities -- three interior ministry officials and a child -- included the director of the falluja police intelligence department, the deputy police chief of the garma police station, the police commissioner and a 7-year-old boy, police said. the wounded included a 5-year-old boy and a police official, police said. the children -- brothers -- were playing when the vehicle drove by carrying the four police officials, who had attended a funeral in eastern falluja and were returning home when it detonated, police said. iraqi security forces in falluja were investigating the incident. the report of the blast came after bombings in three iraqi cities over the previous day killed five people and wounded several others, police told cnn. in one, a colonel was driving from his home in kirkuk to the town of dibia, where he served as police commander. dibia is about 12 miles north of kirkuk, which is in the country's north. there has been longstanding sectarian tension among kurdish, arab and turkmen people in kirkuk. the colonel was kurdish, but there was no immediate information on whether the bombing was tied to ethnic hostilities. over a two-hour period in and around the capital, baghdad, on wednesday, three attacks wounded several people, police said. attackers shot and critically wounded a police colonel while he was driving near shaab stadium in the east. five people were wounded in a roadside bombing north of the city in taji. and a police commissioner was wounded when a sticky bomb attached to his car exploded. on tuesday night, three people were killed in baghdad when a car bomb exploded on a commercial street in the southwestern saydiya neighborhood. city police said 15 others were wounded. in ramadi, more than 60 miles west of baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded near an iraqi police patrol, and one police officer died. ramadi is in the predominantly sunni arab anbar province, an area engulfed by violence during the height of the iraq war. this came after a bloody sunday, when 17 bombs exploded across baghdad, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than 80, iraqi authorities said. the attacks were the latest in a spate in recent weeks that have raised concerns about iraq's ability to protect itself. prime minister nuri al-maliki said he plans to meet this month with iraqi political leaders to discuss whether to ask that u.s. troops remain in iraq beyond the january 1, 2012, withdrawal deadline. the united nations office in iraq has expressed concern about recent violence targeting government and security officials. al-maliki has said al qaeda and other terrorists are behind the killings, but he also has blamed political movements and security guards, and he has promised to pursue the attackers.",new: the casualties include a 7-year-old boy
"-- when dr. jessie stone decided to give up her career as a doctor in new york in favor of full-time kayaking, she could never have imagined that a kayaking expedition in africa would ultimately lead her back to it. a native of purchase, new york, stone worked hard to achieve her goal of becoming a doctor, attending new york medical college. but at the time of the expedition, in 2003, stone had decided a full-time medical career just wasn't for her. ""i really did not see myself going back to medicine,"" she said. ""then the trip to uganda happened, and everything changed."" according to the unhcr, the united nations refugee agency, uganda has one of the highest malaria death rates in africa. despite being warned the country was facing a dire outbreak, stone embarked on a cross-country kayaking trip to the nile along with e.j., a boat designer for one of her kayaking sponsors, wave sport. they took antimalarial drugs and slept under mosquito nets. they figured they'd be fine. they were wrong. it wasn't long before e.j. came down with malaria, and stone's background as a doctor was called upon. ""luckily for all of us, e.j. ended up being fine,"" she recalls, ""but it was a wake-up call."" it was a wake-up call that piqued stone's interest as a doctor. if e.j. could catch malaria despite precautions, how about those who lived in these malarial regions year-round? stone went to the nearest village and conducted a 50-hut survey. the results astounded her: ""nobody had a mosquito net, not one single person we interviewed. everyone reported at least one child in their household dying from malaria, and everyone wanted more information."" residents of a small village named kyabirwa asked stone, or ""dr. jessie"" as she's known locally, to stay and build a clinic. ""i knew absolutely nothing about it,"" she admitted. but the will was there: on her return to new york, stone raised $25,000 -- enough to build a clinic and found soft power health uganda. stone says that aside from the funds, the support and encouragement of the villagers was vital to bringing the project to fruition. ""to do this work, you need the community's support and blessing,"" she said. ""the entire process is a shared endeavor."" kyabirwa is 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) downstream from jinja, uganda, which sits at the source of the nile river. the clinic now receives 50 to 100 patients a day -- up from eight to 10 when it first opened. patients run the gamut from tiny babies with malaria to those with advanced cancers and other disorders. as well as treating patients, outreach and educational programs form a large part of soft power health's doctrine. stone says its malaria outreach programs have taught more than 100,000 people about prevention and provided more than 45,000 mosquito nets to the community at a fraction of the cost. with one of the highest birth rates in africa, stone discovered, many ugandans had little to no education about conception or contraception. her family planning outreach works in 39 villages every three months and has overtaken even the malaria outreach in popularity. stone describes vast differences in the communities she serves since the clinic began. she says knowledge of malaria prevention is much more widespread, and she's seen a huge increase in the numbers of people sleeping under mosquito nets. stone says soft power health's reputation has grown to the point where patients now come from all over uganda. (it has implemented a referral system to assist with some more complicated diseases). these days, kayaking has taken a back seat to doctoring for 44-year-old stone, who has relegated it from full-time job to part-time stress reliever, but she still takes part in freestyle kayaking and will be competing in the american circuit in colorado this summer. stone now lives in uganda five or six months of the year, despite the fact that a recently completed dam has turned the nearby section of whitewater she used to kayak into a lake. she says the locals fear that fewer kayaking opportunities mean she'll leave, but she reassures them that as long is the need is there, so is she. ""i feel very lucky to be able to do this work,"" she said. ""you just never know what life has in store for you!""","dr. jessie stone gave up medicine to be a kayaker, but medicine found her again"
"-- not many businessmen can claim the superstar status of carlos ghosn. but then not many businessmen are at the helm of not one, but two of the world's biggest car makers. renault-nissan ceo carlos ghosn smiles at the monaco formula one grand prix on may 25, 2008. brazilian-born ghosn has not always been a superstar in japan. when he arrived in tokyo in 1999 to revive the fortunes of nissan, he took plenty of flak after slashing more than 20,000 jobs and closing assembly plants. but when his ""nissan revival plan"" worked -- he resurrected the car maker from near bankruptcy a year earlier than scheduled -- he became a hero. these days ghosn gets the sort of adulation in japan normally reserved for rock stars and football players. he is often mobbed by fans in search of an autograph and has even been portrayed as a manga comic book superhero in ""the true story of carlos ghosn."" his face has graced the covers of japanese business magazines, he is the subject of a handful of books and has even written his own. ghosn was born on march 9, 1954, to lebanese parents. his family moved to lebanon when he was a toddler, and he later studied engineering at ecole polytechnique and ecole des mines de paris in france, where he is a citizen. fluent in french, arabic, english and portuguese -- and quickly catching up in japanese -- ghosn is the quintessential international businessman. his career in the auto industry began in 1978 at europe's largest tiremaker, michelin, where he worked for 18 years, moving up the ranks from plant manager to chief operating officer. he headed both michelin's south american and north american units during his tenure with the company, achieving success at both. he joined renault in 1996 as executive vice president, and was sent to japan to revive nissan three years later. since may 2005, all the while staying at the helm of nissan, he has taken the reins of french car company renault, which owns 44 percent of nissan. the man dubbed ""samurai"" and ""le cost killer"" for his reputation for restructuring companies is not only ceo and president of nissan and renault, he is also on the board of alcoa, sony and ibm. running two of the world's biggest car companies means splitting his time between paris and tokyo and fitting in meetings, visits to plants and dealerships, as well as attending car shows all over the world and catalyzing spectacular model launches. but despite his busy lifestyle, it is not all business for ghosn. married to wife rita, whom he met 22 years ago in france, the couple have four children -- caroline, nadine, maya and anthony -- and ghosn is known for making time to spend with his family. and at nissan's new advanced technology center in yokohama, japan, all employees are asked to leave the building each day no later than 8 p.m., so as to avoid sombering into workaholism. he's revived the fortunes of japan's second biggest car maker, was named man of the year in 2002 by french magazine le journal de l'automobile and businessman of the year by fortune magazine the same year. but he has said his most cherished titled is being named father of the year by a japanese community group in 2001.",ghosn resurrected nissan from near bankruptcy after taking over in 1999
"-- controversial manchester city striker mario balotelli will be given another chance after being caught in a heated training ground bust-up with manager roberto mancini on thursday. photographers outside the english premier league champions' training ground captured images of the pair grappling, prompting coaching staff to intervene to separate them. balotelli then walked off the pitch, before leaving the training ground about 10 minutes later. the flamboyant 22-year-old has infuriated his manager on several occasions since being signed from inter milan for $39.1 million in 2010. mancini recently said that the italy international needed to train harder to make the playing team, and once threatened he may never play for manchester city again after he was sent off during a defeat at arsenal. but in a statement on the club's website, mancini -- who the photographs suggest was the aggressor, repeatedly tugging the player's clothes -- downplayed the exchange, which was sparked by balotelli's hostile challenge on scott sinclair. ""mario made a tackle on his teammate that i would prefer to see in a game, and not against a teammate,"" said mancini. ""i asked him to leave the pitch -- he said no, so i moved him off. that's all that happened and it was nothing more than that."" the italian described the incident as ""nothing unusual"" and insisted it had ""already been forgotten."" balotelli appeared at the club as usual for training on friday. ""my thoughts have not changed about him and these things happen from time to time,"" mancini said. ""will mario have more chances? i will give him 100 chances as long as i can see him trying to improve and working hard for this football club."" the gifted but inconsistent performer's relationship with his club and manager have often been strained, prompting mancini to once remark after a match that if balotelli had been a teammate during his own playing days, he may have given him a punch in the head every day. since his arrival in the uk, balotelli has made headlines for setting his house on fire with fireworks, handing out wads of money to the homeless, tussling with teammates on the pitch and throwing darts at his club's youth team players. his poor disciplinary record, which saw him miss a total of 11 domestic and european games through suspension during the past season, led the club to dock him two weeks' wages. balotelli appealed to an english premier league tribunal over the fine, but recently dropped the matter in a gesture the club described as ""a sign of respect for roberto mancini, the supporters and the club."" despite balotelli's failure to impress on the pitch this season, mancini recently insisted the club would not be selling the striker during the january transfer window, stressing his ""love"" for his fiery compatriot -- who he also managed at inter. ""i think mario will stay but the future depends mostly on him,"" he told italian media. ""the relationship between me and him is always good, even if one day he does something. i love him because for many years we live together. i've seen him grow. but the professional relationship is another thing and i've told mario what i need from him. ""the time of cheap talk is over. balotelli is 22 years old and now it's time to be professional. i ask from him seriousness and commitment in training, a more stable private life and correct behavior on the pitch.""",mario balotelli and roberto mancini were embroiled in bust up in training on thursday
"-- as the supreme court prepares to hear arguments in the constitutionality of the health care reform law, cnn spoke with two experts on opposing sides of the issue. karen harned is executive director of small business legal center for the national federation of independent business. the group, along with 26 states, will appear at the court's oral arguments. nfib represents 350,000 small-business owners. (ron pollack, founding executive director of families usa, is for the health care reform law. read his viewpoint here). the following interview with harned is edited for clarity and brevity: cnn: has the u.s. reached a health care crisis that justified the law supported by president barack obama and most democrats in congress? karen harned: ""we strongly think that our system is broken, and nfib for two decades has been aggressively fighting for health insurance reforms. the reforms we wanted unfortunately were not included in the final law. they were reforms that would not drive down the cost of health insurance. that has been the number one issue for small-business owners. ""we are very much not of the 'just say no' crowd, we think the status quo is not acceptable. our members are very vocal on that. the problem is that the reforms that we advocated were the ones that ended up landing on the cutting room floor and that congress made a bad situation worse."" preview: 'the implications ... are impossible to overstate' cnn: but proponents argue there are tax incentives and other benefits designed to help small businesses provide health coverage for their small staffs. harned: ""of course, there are provisions in this law that small-business owners like. on the big picture, our small-business owners don't get to pick and choose which provisions of the law apply to them, in addition to the two better provisions. there are numerous new tax increases, but there's also an unconstitutional infringement of individual liberty in the form of individual mandates that require everyone to buy health insurance or pay a fine. so at the end of the day, the small-business owners that we represent saw more bad than good. ""the tax credit has been highlighted by the administration as something that's great for small business, but what we have found is that most of our members are not going to get that full credit. and the extent to which they get that credit, it's just not that significant. because the amount of the tax incentive goes down as you either add employees or pay them more. it's actually disincentivizing small-business owners to grow their businesses."" cnn: why in your view is the individual mandate requiring most americans to purchase some form of health issuance an unconstitutional provision? harned: ""if it's upheld, then the constitution is essentially giving congress the authority to create a command-and-control economy. this is about them telling us all sorts of things that we have to buy or contracts that we need to enter into. this is exactly the opposite of what we want to see -- congress telling you where you need to be shopping, what you need to buy. two families, two viewpoints on health reform ""it also is just amending decades -- maybe centuries -- of contract law because you always have two willing participants. those are things that fundamentally strike at the core of the small-business owners that i represent; it offends them to no end. as a practical matter, there are dollars and cents attached to this. i've talked to members who say, 'look, this is a no-brainer.' "" cnn: so you worry the federal government would only expand its authority over commerce? harned: ""the government has only made this worse in how they've argued this case, because they've been unable in every court they've been in before, to say where it would end. ""as recently as the federal d.c. circuit court of appeals case, where judge [laurence] silberman asked them [the justice department lawyers] point blank, 'is it unconstitutional to regulate broccoli?' and [the government lawyer] said, 'well, it depends.' now it's like we're not citizens of this country anymore, we're merely subjects, if this individual mandate goes through."" cnn: should congress start all over and craft a new health care bill? harned: ""nfib went into this with the intention of striking down the entire law. we have demanded for decades that we get health insurance reform that drives down the cost of health insurance for small-business owners because that market is severely broken. ""we also believe, as the government has continued to argue, that the individual mandate is key, integral, to its operation. without the individual mandate, it cannot stand. even some of the provisions that people think are relatively extraneous come back, at least from a cost perspective, to the individual mandate. and if you don't have that, how does the rest of it work? ""... and the answer here is clearly no, because the two things that the law was said to be accomplishing were to increase coverage. the individual mandate is very key to increasing coverage. and reducing costs -- again by getting everybody into the pool, they're basically having the young, healthy people subsidizing the older population. that is supposed to be helping to lower costs for all. ""when you take that out, we don't see how the entire law works as congress intended. and we definitely don't think congress would have passed it without the individual mandate."" cnn: what is your message to the supreme court as they take on this legal challenge? harned: ""we think the law is on our side. we think it's very clear that the founding fathers never intended to see congress telling people what products they should buy. if you look at the justifications the government gives, the text doesn't support this mandate, the constitution doesn't support it, and if the justices rule that the individual mandate is constitutional, they are going to basically open the door for congress to legislate whatever mandates it finds appropriate that it will impose on individuals. ""we think the law, the constitution, is very much on our side. that's what they're charged with upholding.""",karen harned speaks for the national federation of independent business
"-- mary peterson of des moines, washington, doesn't believe the vaccine for the novel h1n1 flu has been studied enough to get it for herself and her daughters, who are 1 and 3 years old. mary peterson's daughters, 3 and 1, will not be getting the new vaccine, she said. ""i wrestled with it,"" she said. ""i think the side of caution in this case is just waiting until we have more information."" peterson is one of many parents who are discussing -- whether in real life or on twitter -- their skepticism of the vaccine. the vaccine is being distributed as an intranasal spray this week, and will arrive next week in injection form, said dr. thomas frieden, director of the centers for disease control and prevention, earlier this week. the cdc and other public health authorities say the new vaccine is safe, and are encouraging everyone to get it, especially those in high risk groups. but experts acknowledge that many people struggle with the decision. take a quiz about h1n1 flu » ""i bet half the people in the country have concerns,"" dr. mehmet oz, host of the ""dr. oz show"" and professor of surgery at columbia university, told cnn's anderson cooper earlier this week. ""be knowledgeable, though, that the h1n1 swine flu vaccine is built on a chassis of the older original seasonal vaccine. so, it should have similar risks, which have proven to be very low,"" he said. priority groups for the vaccine include pregnant women, caregivers and household contacts of children younger than 6 months, people between the ages of 6 months and 24 years, and anyone ages 25 to 64 with existing health problems, according to the cdc. a recent survey from the harvard school of public health found that just 40 percent of adults say they are ""absolutely certain"" they will get the h1n1 vaccine. an additional 41 percent said they ""will not get it,"" and the rest of the sample had various degrees of certainty. ireport.com: are you getting the vaccine? ""you've got a significant group of people who at the moment wouldn't do it,"" said robert blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the harvard school of public health, who led the study. still, nearly 60 percent of those who say they don't think they'll get vaccinated would change their minds if there were sickness or death in their community, the study found. see h1n1 in your geographic area » moreover, 51 percent of parents said they were ""absolutely certain"" to get it for their children. again, about 60 percent of the skeptical parents would change their mind in the event of community sickness and death. one major group of people who say they probably won't get the vaccine are those primarily concerned about safety, blendon said. peterson isn't against all vaccines -- she and her daughters have already gotten the seasonal flu vaccine, for example. but she is concerned about mercury in some of the new vaccine varieties. thimerosal, a mercury preservative found in the multi-dose vial h1n1 vaccines, has been controversially linked to autism, though no studies have proved that theory. peterson said she is also concerned about the toxicity of mercury. but the cdc says there is no evidence that thimerosal is harmful to pregnant women or fetuses. vaccine companies are making vaccine types for both seasonal flu and h1n1 flu without this mercury-based preservative. the other main reason that people cite for not getting the vaccine is that they do not believe they are vulnerable to the disease, blendon said. crystal fincher, who works in sales in seattle, washington, has both safety and vulnerability in mind. she has decided against vaccinating herself and her 12-year-old son both because she doesn't believe there is enough safety information about it, and because she doesn't think she and her son are in high-risk groups. fincher said her son's own physician told her the risks of combining the new h1n1 vaccine with his other scheduled vaccines -- for example, tetanus and diphtheria -- are not yet known. ""i just don't feel like there's a risk of having a complication from swine flu is high enough to proceed to taking that, but i would be open in the future once there was more data available,"" she said. teresa rogers, a pharmacy technician in rockford, michigan, said she will not be getting the swine flu vaccine because she believes it has not been tested enough. her children, who are grown, will probably not get it either, and her co-workers at the pharmacy are split. ""i'm not going to be a guinea pig,"" she said. but karen walrond, a photographer and writer in houston, texas, said she will vaccinate her 5-year-old daughter, whose asthma flares up as a result of colds and flus. ""we will probably go ahead and risk it,"" she said. walrond herself will probably also get vaccinated, if only ""in moral support"" of her daughter, she said. oz said he will get the vaccine, but his wife will not, and the kids will go along with her, as in most families. ""i think we're going to have this battle within american families and within our culture. it should be a productive one, though,"" he said. ""it's about getting the middle mass of americans to say, 'you know what, this is what i think: i'm going to go with the system and get the vaccine.'

""the focus is now on aleppo, where there has been a considerable buildup of military means, and where we have reason to believe that the main battle is about to start,"" said herve ladsous, the united nations under-secretary-general for peacekeeping operations. ladsous spoke to reporters and briefed the u.n. security council thursday, hours after syrian rebels battered a military base near aleppo as the battle for the nation's most populous city raged. rebels used tanks seized in previous clashes with government troops to pound the menagh military airport, the opposition syrian observatory for human rights said. the base is north of aleppo, syria's commercial capital. the main military airfield in the region is southeast of the city. the government-run syrian arab news agency said authorities were ""killing or wounding dozens of terrorists"" in the countryside outside aleppo. regime warplanes shelled the western and northern parts of the city, the opposition local coordination committees of syria said. communication was spotty inside the besieged city. cellular phone service was cut off, and power outages were reported in neighborhoods where there was heavy shelling, according to deama, an activist there who asked that her full name not be used for her protection. thursday's fighting comes amid unsuccessful international diplomacy. kofi annan, who championed a six-point peace plan this year, said he has resigned as the u.n. and arab league joint special envoy to syria. while diplomats debate how to handle the situation, there has been stepped-up help for the emboldened rebel forces, dominated by military defectors who have streamed into the opposition's arms for months. obama authorized covert support for syrian rebels, sources say rebels are now equipped with heavy weaponry, including tanks, the united nations said, a sign that the armed resistance to president bashar al-assad's regime is gaining military potency. government forces also used heavy weapons in the clashes. mig-23 fighter jets struck rebels in an aleppo village, said capt. ammar al-wawi of the free syrian army. syrian state tv said soldiers ""have been able to eliminate scores of terrorists and mercenaries"" in aleppo and claim to be sweeping through the city's salaheddine neighborhood and towns west of aleppo. shelling and clashes have raged across the city for days, prompting thousands to flee their homes. both rebels and government forces are placing great importance on gaining control of the metropolis. but aleppo was not the only hot spot in thursday's fighting. anti-al-assad fighters and government forces continued clashing across syria. at least 130 people were killed throughout the country thursday, including 50 in damascus and its suburbs and seven in aleppo province, the lcc said. the opposition activist network blamed government troops for an attack on a palestinian refugee camp in southern damascus that killed 15 people. more than 50 others were wounded due to heavy shelling in the area, the lcc said. syrian state television said terrorists were behind the attack, adding that authorities were searching for those responsible. in an online video purporting to show the camp after the shelling, men ran past charred, bloodied bodies on the street. in the background, a woman screamed. another video purportedly showing the camp later thursday night showed protesters chanting ""the people want to bring down the regime."" cnn cannot independently confirm reports of violence in syria because the government has limited access by international journalists. syria's uprising: from rocks to rpgs the fighting has devastated the syrian economy and left many people in dire straits. as many as 3 million syrians will need food in the next 12 months as farmers in the conflict-ravaged nation lose assets and livestock, the united nations said in a report thursday. the syrian agricultural sector has suffered $1.8 billion in losses this year, including crops, livestock and irrigation systems, according to the report. ""while the economic implications of these losses are quite grave, the humanitarian implications are far more pressing,"" said muhannad hadi, the world food programme representative in syria. the syrian crisis started when al-assad's security forces launched a violent crackdown on peaceful protests in march 2011. that clampdown spurred a nationwide uprising as armed rebels, including military defectors and other fighters, battled under the free syrian army. the conflict has claimed roughly 17,000 lives, u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon said last week. opposition activists put the toll at more than 20,000. a key question remains: whether united nations observers will remain in syria. the group's mandate is set to expire on august 19. the 150 military observers and 80 civilians remaining in syria conducted more than 50 patrols over the past few weeks, according to ladsous, the united nations' peacekeeping chief. ""they report, they inform us. and they try -- wherever it's possible -- to mediate, to arrange local ceasefires, humanitarian pauses to allow civilian populations to withdraw from shelling areas,"" he said. meanwhile, u.n. security council president gerard araud suggested that the council should consider shifting its attentions toward humanitarian problems in syria.

"-- more and more, today's video game business is driven by huge military shooters like activision's ""call of duty: modern warfare 3"" and electronic arts' ""battlefield 3."" now, erik prince, the founder of a controversial, real-world military group, is stepping into the virtual war zone with a new first-person shooter, ""blackwater."" designed exclusively for microsoft's kinect for xbox 360, ""blackwater"" was developed by zombie studios and overseen by prince, a former navy seal. the shooter is set in a fictional north african town overrun by warlords and opposing militia forces. players enter the fray as team members of blackwater, the mercenaries-for-hire company that prince founded in 1997. featuring licensed real-world weapons, the game can be played with a traditional controller. but it has been crafted to take advantage of kinect's motion controls. gamers will be able to aim, crouch, and interact with the on-screen action using only body gestures and moves to take out enemies through a series of action-packed missions. the game has already courted controversy, since blackwater employees were linked to the deaths of numerous noncombatants and civilians in the middle east while employed by the u.s. government. critics have complained about the game because blackwater employees take on missions for money, while u.s. soldiers, the focal point of games like ""modern warfare 3"" and ""battlefield 3,"" fight for their country. following inquiries by congress into blackwater actions in iraq and afghanistan, including a shootout that led to the deaths of 17 iraqis, prince changed the company's name to xe and, in 2009, resigned as ceo. he sold the company last year. although the game was created with the aid of former blackwater employees, the gameplay does not put players in situations where civilians or noncombatants are targets. the same cannot be said about ""modern warfare 2,"" which earned more than $1 billion for activision a couple of years ago. that fictional game featured an intense airport sequence in which players were forced to target innocent civilians as an undercover terrorist or risk having their cover blown and being executed. prince talked to cnn in an exclusive interview about the first shooter designed for kinect, why he decided to enter the games business and what gadget he can't live without. cnn: why did you decide to enter the video game business? prince: video games are an exciting medium. the creativity of design, the technology and the interaction represent the best of american innovation. my father was a brilliant inventor and businessman. he taught me to appreciate the opportunities that america offers to innovators. working with the brilliant creators in this industry was a logical progression for me. cnn: how involved were you in this game? prince: i set the overall vision and mission areas for this game. my guidelines were to be interactive, tactically correct, fun and expandable, meaning we can add additional missions and accessories to the game going forward. cnn: what did you learn about how video games are made from this experience? prince: i now realize that the video game industry is very large and sophisticated, larger even than hollywood in terms of volume. there is every aspect of specialization in the production of these games. integrating physical motion into on-screen motion is an exciting new frontier for the industry. cnn: how do you think the blackwater brand will appeal to the gaming demographic? prince: i believe ""blackwater"" will have a unique appeal to gamers, particularly on the kinect platform. the physical, visual and virtual feel of participating in a mission brings a level of excitement and realism to the game that is hard to match. and frankly, it's fun. i think gamers will really enjoy playing the game. cnn: do you play games or have any background playing games? if so, what have you played lately? prince: i'm afraid i don't have time to play any games these days. i certainly played a lot when i was a kid and i know it helped develop my hand to eye coordination. cnn: what are your thoughts on how video games have evolved over the years? prince: the video game industry is constantly evolving. the sheer creativity matched with cutting-edge technologies gives me the comfort that innovation is alive and well in america. and we can see the impact that the gaming industry is having on other entertainment media, as well as military training or flight simulation. it's a fascinating synthesis of ideas, technologies and platforms. cnn: how does this game being a blackwater experience differentiate it from franchises like ""call of duty: modern warfare,"" ""medal of honor"" and ""battlefield""? prince: ""blackwater"" on the kinect system gets you up and moving. you'll have to act and react with something more than your thumbs. it is definitely the next step of progression into a truly interactive experience. cnn: why do you think simulation military shooters are so popular today? ""call of duty"" is the biggest game franchise of all time. prince: the popularity of simulation military shooters today is really no different from the popularity of playing soldier or cops-and-robbers when we were kids. take timeless themes of courage, good vs. evil and war, and add today's technology and you get a very popular genre. we've taken the proven concept a step further with this game by having the player actually have to move their body to navigate the game. the military uses video games -- from america's army online game to the new dismounted soldier training system (which uses the crytek game engine and virtual reality to train squads in war zones). cnn: what are your thoughts on the role games are playing in training in the military today? prince: training for any difficult job is essential. combat being the most difficult, it's the same reason the navy started the top gun program during vietnam, because they were losing way too many new pilots during air combat. top gun, by giving pilots realistic experiences simulating combat, drastically improved their performance and survivability. with video game simulations, dod is providing many of the same sights/sounds and system overloading experiences to soldiers before they encounter a real firefight so they are prepared to make good decisions in the middle of all that stress. cnn: outside of work, what's a favorite piece of technology or gadget that you can't live without and why? prince: my kids would certainly comment on my use (or overuse) of a blackberry and ipad.","gamers can aim, crouch and interact with the on-screen action using only body gestures"
"a fight has broken out between two of the most prominent members of the republican party: texas sen. ted cruz and kentucky sen. rand paul. in an op-ed for breitbart news, paul took a shot at cruz, without actually naming him, when he wrote, ""i will remind anyone who thinks we will win elections by trashing previous republican nominees or holding oneself out as some paragon in the mold of reagan, that splintering the party is not the route to victory."" this was just one more flash point in the ongoing tension that has characterized their relationship. the back-and-forth has captured considerable attention since both men have been discussed as possible contenders for the republican nomination in 2016. each is seen as representing a different faction of the republican right: cruz the take-no-prisoners, slash-and-burn conservatives who will do just about anything to obtain their objectives and paul the libertarian voice pushing back against all forms of government. if cruz and paul turn out to be the major spokespersons for the debate about where the republican party should go, then the party is going to be in some big trouble. cruz represents an extremist wing of the gop that can't seem to govern. since the emergence of the tea party in 2009, the republican party has been shaped by a group of politicians who have been willing to employ extraordinarily aggressive tactics in the pursuit of cuts to domestic spending. nobody has symbolized this style of leadership more than cruz. he led the drumbeat to shut down the federal government to force president obama's hand on spending and has favored the republican refusal to raise the debt ceiling. cruz has also been a master of the filibuster, employing variations of the tactic to bring the senate to a standstill. this image of obstructionist governance might excite the most loyal activists in the party, but it is not a style conducive to presidential leadership and it is not a style that plays well at a national level. republicans have suffered greatly in the polls as a result of these kinds of extremist tactics. one recent poll found that four out of five americans don't trust the republican party. ""that's just about as bad as it gets,"" noted msnbc host, and republican, joe scarborough. many americans question whether the republicans can govern. a cruz candidacy would perfectly set up a hillary clinton candidacy by allowing democrats to emphasize her ability to get things done and make the political system work. rand paul represents a different problem: he is a politician whose rhetoric is totally at odds with the history of the gop. since the 1930s, libertarians have had trouble gaining traction within the party. the reality has been that most republicans have embraced the federal government as a permanent part of national politics. in the area of national security, the party has been a driving force behind the expansion of the military establishment since the cold war. while some republicans like paul might now rail against the surveillance tactics of the national security agency, the recent power of this agency was built on the foundation that republicans built with the war on terrorism under president george w. bush. neither have republicans been a true small government party in domestic policy. studies have shown how federal spending has grown more dramatically under republican presidents, including ronald reagan, than democrats. most republicans have avoided cutting most of the big-ticket programs, such as social security or farm assistance, while pushing for an expansion of government in other areas, such as medicare prescription drugs. republican legislators have been as skillful at pork-barrel politics as anyone from the other side of the aisle. though paul may claim he will do things differently, democrats could have a field day challenging the veracity of such claims given the weight of history that he faces. the weaknesses of both men—cruz in terms of his style and paul in terms of his rhetoric—point out how desperate the gop is to find someone who can build a broad coalition, something that is essential for a presidential victory, particularly when republicans will likely be facing a formidable candidate. the problems of new jersey gov. chris christie have been a huge blow to the party, and there are not many alternatives at this point who are willing to run to replace a figure who, in terms of style of governance and rhetoric, would have a better chance of appealing to voters beyond the base. this is the reason former florida gov. jeb bush is getting so much buzz, as potentially the only other person who can fill this void. if republicans can't find some alternative and the primaries revolve around the tension between ted cruz and rand paul, democrats will be in excellent position to retain the white house in 2016.",sen. rand paul takes verbal shot at his potential 2016 rival ted cruz
"-- nicklas bendtner scored a hat-trick as a rampant arsenal side thrashed porto 5-0 at the emirates to reach the quarterfinals of the champions league on tuesday. danish international bendtner had been widely criticized for missing a host of chances in arsenal's 3-1 premier league win over burnley on saturday -- however, he was in the right place at the right time twice in the first-half as the londonders comfortably overturned their 2-1 first leg deficit. the opening goal came in the 10th minute when bendtner was on hand to fire into an empty net after goalkeeper helton had rushed out to block the on-coming andrey arshavin. and he doubled the lead 15 minutes later after more good work from russian arshavin, who evaded two challenges on the edge of the area before crossing for the striker to comfortably slot home. porto came out with more determination after the break but were hit by two goals in the space of three minutes around the hour mark. first, frenchman samir nasir produced a moment of breathtaking skill and fast foot-work to dance around three porto challenges before firing past helton from an acute angle. then, with their portuguese opponents chasing the game, arshavin collected the ball on the break after a porto corner was cleared. he had emmanuel eboue overlapping in support -- and the pass was perfect for the ivorian to round the goalkeeper before stroking the ball home. and a superb night for arsenal -- and bendtner in particular -- was completed in the final minute when eboue was fouled in the penalty area, and the dane stepped up to fire his penalty wide of helton's despairing dive. arsenal manager arsene wenger told sky sports: ""it's never perfect but it was a very good performance, a strong performance. ""we had a very good first half, suffered a bit at the beginning of the second half, but nasri's goal made a big difference and from then it was easy."" meanwhile, bayern munich are also through to the last eight, progressing on the away goals rule despite losing 3-2 at fiorentina. their qualification was sealed with a stunning strike from dutchman arjen robben, who skipped past a couple of challenges before firing home a thunderbolt shot from a full 30 meters out. the serie a side took a 28th-minute lead when juan vargas netted from a tight angle after a week clearance from goalkeeper jorg butt. and the hosts doubled their advantage nine minutes after the break when stevan jovetic scored from close range after a superb alberto gilardino backheel. bayern made the scores level 3-3 on aggregate on the hour mark when mark van bommel drilled home a low shot after good work from frank ribery. however, just four minutes later montenerin striker jovetic out-muscled daniel van buyten to fire home a gilardino header-on. that sparked wild celebrations from the home bench and supporters, but just 72 seconds later robben unleashed his devastating strike to break florence hearts and complete a crazy spell of four goals in 12 minutes.",arsenal thrash porto 5-0 to cruise into the quarterfinals of the champions league
"-- china will maintain its one-child policy for at least another decade, the country's family planning minister said in an interview published monday. nearly 200 million chinese will enter child-bearing age over the next 10 years, the government says. the policy, begun in the 1970s, prohibits most couples from bearing more than one child. nearly 200 million chinese will enter child-bearing age in the next 10 years, minister zhang weiqing told the china daily newspaper. he said abandoning the policy during this period would cause ""serious problems and add extra pressure on social and economic development."" ""after the new birth peak ends, we may adjust the policy if there is a need,"" he said. china's population, which now stands at about 1.3 billion, is growing at the rate of 0.6 percent and is expected to peak around 1.6 billion by 2050, according to the u.s. state department. china's communist party first implemented the one-child rule three decades ago amid fears that the country would not be able to feed a skyrocketing population. the policy has prevented about 400 million births, the china daily said. families living in cities are barred from having more than one child -- unless neither parents have siblings. in rural areas, the law allows for a second child under certain circumstances. and the guidelines are also looser for ethnic minorities with small population. enforcement varies but usually takes the form of fines to discourage extra births. while the policy has helped curb population growth, it has also led to forced sterilizations in some parts of the country, the state department said. because of a traditional preference for male heirs, many chinese have aborted female fetuses, according to human rights groups. even within the country, there have been growing calls in recent years for the law to be overhauled, the china daily said. some chinese worry that the law has led to a gender imbalance. they also worry about china's aging population. those 60 years of age and older are expected to make up more than 200 million in the next seven years, according to government figures. zhang said the problems should not be blamed solely on the one-child rule and ""it will be simplistic"" to look for a single approach in addressing them. e-mail to a friend","china to keep one child policy for at least another decade, minister says"
"if the federal government shuts down starting tuesday because of a bitter partisan battle over the new health care law, more people say congressional republicans rather than president barack obama would be responsible, according to a new national survey. a cnn/orc international poll released monday morning, hours before funding for the government is scheduled to run out, also indicates that most americans think republicans in congress are acting like spoiled children in this fiscal fight, with the public divided on whether the president is acting like a spoiled child or a responsible adult. and six in 10 questioned in the survey say they want congress to approve a budget agreement to avoid a government shutdown, and if it happens, most people say a shutdown would be a bad thing for the country. the poll's release comes one day after the gop-dominated house of representatives approved a spending plan to fund the government that would delay the affordable care act, better known as obamacare, for a year, and repeal its tax on medical devices. 10 ways a shutdown would affect daily life that measure now heads back to senate later monday, where the democratic majority has said any changes to the health care law would be a deal-killer. if no deal is reached on a temporary funding measure, a government shutdown would kick in at 12:01 a.m. et tuesday. according to the poll, which was conducted friday through sunday, 46% say they would blame congressional republicans for a government shutdown, with 36% saying the president would be more responsible and 13% pointing fingers at both the gop in congress and obama. ""the number who would hold congressional republicans responsible has gone down by 5 points since early september, and the number who would blame obama is up 3 points in that same time,"" said cnn polling director keating holland. ""those changes came among most demographic groups."" the cnn poll is similar to a cbs news/new york times survey released late last week that indicated 44% blaming congressional republicans and 35% pointing fingers at the president. two other polls conducted in the past week and a half, from pew research center and united technologies/national journal, showed a much closer margin but their questions mentioned republicans in general rather than the gop in congress. while most democrats questioned in the cnn poll would predictably blame congressional republicans and most republicans questioned would point fingers at the president, independents were divided on which side they would blame. in a separate question, 49% of all people in the poll say that obama is acting like a responsible adult in this budget battle, with 47% describing him as a spoiled child. while that's nothing to brag about, it's better than congress. read the entire cnn/orc poll according to the poll, 58% say congressional democrats are acting like spoiled children, with that number rising to 69% for the gop in congress. only one in four say congressional republicans are acting like responsible adults. some 68% say a shutdown for a few days would be a bad thing for the country, with that number rising to nearly eight in 10 for a shutdown lasting a few weeks. six in 10 questioned in the cnn survey say that it is more important for congress to avoid a shutdown than to make major changes to the new health care law, with only a third saying it is more important for lawmakers to prevent major provisions in the new health care law from taking effect by cutting the funds needed to implement them. (note: when cnn began interviews for this poll on friday evening, the senate had just stripped out of its bill the house republican measure to defund the health care law. what the house passed this weekend doesn't specifically call for a defunding of obamacare -- instead it delays its implementation for a year -- but the repeal on medical devices would cut key funding for the law.) the drive to overthrow the health care law, which was passed in 2010 when democrats controlled both houses of congress, is being fueled by gop lawmakers voted into office the past two elections with the strong support of tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives. ""a majority of republicans think that blocking obamacare is more important than approving a budget agreement,"" said holland. ""so do tea party supporters, regardless of their partisan affiliation."" ""who's driving this strategy: 40 to 50 of the most conservative members of the house, and four or five of the most conservative members of the senate,"" says cnn chief national correspondent john king. ""fifty-six percent of tea party supporters say it's a good thing to shut down the government. these are the folks those most conservative members of congress are listening to. those lawmakers think back home they're on safe ground even though nationally shutting down the government is a non-starter."" the poll indicates that obamacare is not popular, with 57% saying they oppose the law, up 3 points from may, and 38% saying they support the measure, down five points from may. but only about four in 10 oppose it because it is too liberal, with about one in 10 saying they don't like the law because it is not liberal enough. if you add the 38% who favor the law to the 11% to oppose the law because it's not liberal enough, you get 49%, compared with the 39% who say they oppose the law because it's too liberal. the poll was conducted for cnn by orc international september 27-29, with 803 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. the survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. the questions where do you stand? add your thoughts in the comments below: question: if the federal government shuts down, do you think that barack obama or the republicans in congress would be more responsible for that? question: do you think barack obama has acted mostly like a responsible adult or mostly like a spoiled child during the recent debate over the federal budget? question: do you think the republicans in congress have acted mostly like responsible adults or mostly like spoiled children during the recent debate over the federal budget? question: do you think the democrats in congress have acted mostly like responsible adults or mostly like spoiled children during the recent debate over the federal budget? a political game of chicken as shutdown looms house republicans: senate is running out the clock architect of the brink: meet the man behind the looming shutdown",cnn/orc international poll: six in 10 say they want budget deal to avoid shutdown
"dan condon believes in recycling. just not when it comes to his hotel towels. condon composts when he's at home in boulder, colorado. he eats local, organic and fair-trade food and drives a honda cr-z hybrid sports car. you might call him green. except he's not so green when he travels for his work at an education nonprofit and stays in a hotel, which happens about 10 weeks per year. there, he uses a new towel every day. and don't try to bribe him with a drink or dessert coupon to get him to reuse the same one. ""i could care less about rewards for environmentally conscious behavior unless it's miles,"" condon wrote in an e-mail. if hotels can't convince a hybrid-driving recycling enthusiast like condon to go green while traveling, how can they possibly convince everyone else? 9 glamorous movie-star hotels that's the problem of hotels trying to ""green"" your hotel stay. after guests have paid a pretty penny for a night at the inn, even the most environmental guests may want to treat themselves to fresh towels every day and those little bottles of sweet-smelling shampoo. despite the fact that most people describe themselves in surveys as environmentally conscious and as preferring green products, there's a big gap between consumer attitudes and consumer behaviors when it comes to going green, said michael giebelhausen, a marketing professor at the cornell university school of hotel administration. ""it can be nice to have fresh towels, and not doing so is a sacrifice,"" said giebelhausen, whose current research focuses on the impact of hotel sustainability programs on guest satisfaction. ""participating requires some effort, and there's some cost to be incurred on the part of the consumer."" guests who go green are happy nearly 90% of hotel guests are offered the chance to do something sustainable during their stays, and about two-thirds will participate, according to giebelhausen's analysis of 2011 data from the j.d. power and associates north america hotel guest satisfaction study. those guests who participate in a hotel's green programs report that they are more satisfied with their stays than guests who do not participate. participating in a hotel's sustainability program provides ""a feeling that it was good to be green, it made them feel good about themselves, and that translated to the service provider,"" giebelhausen said. 8 getaways we wish we could afford ""these guests, who are ostensibly receiving a lower level of service, report being more satisfied overall with their stay."" there's just one catch: guests who don't participate in voluntary sustainability programs reported the lowest levels of satisfaction with their hotel stays. ""one explanation for these findings is that when people don't live up to their ideals, and vice versa, this affects how satisfied they are with the entity that presented them this 'moral dilemma,'"" giebelhausen said. sustainability is becoming the norm it makes business sense for hotels to go green: increasing sewage rates, stricter water use requirements and more recycling options are all convincing hotels to reduce their water and energy costs, said hotel industry veteran pat maher, an environmental consultant and ""green guru"" for the american hotel & lodging association. more than 75% of u.s. hotels have linen and towel reuse programs, 59% have guest or internal recycling programs, and 46% have a water-saving program, according to a 2012 american hotel & lodging association survey of its members. they also have ""back of the house"" programs that include low-flow shower heads, faucets and toilets; energy-efficient light bulbs, high-efficiency appliances and other efforts. some are required by local governments; others just make business sense. that translates into real dollars: the u.s. environmental protection agency has found that hotels and other lodging facilities use more than 510 trillion btu of energy annually at a cost of more than $7.4 billion. that energy use generates 54 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, equal to the emissions from more than 11 million passenger vehicles, according to the agency. beyond mickey mouse: best cruises for 2013 the epa reports that the lodging industry could save $745 million annually by reducing energy use by 10%. that translates to 60 cents more revenue per room night at limited-service hotels and $2 at full-service hotels. annoyed that the hotel's bottom line benefits from your sacrifice? some hotels are trying to make water-saving behavior pay for their guests. participating sheraton hotels & resorts gives guests a $5 food and drink voucher or 500 starwood points for every day they decline housekeeping's services (except departure day). part of the kimpton culture some hotels are making green cool. it seems to be an easier sell for hip, higher-end chains like kimpton hotel & restaurant group's properties, which cultivate an edgier base of customers. about 85% of hotel guests participate in the chain's towel and sheet reuse program, said mike defrino, kimpton's executive vice president of hotel operations. bill kimpton started the boutique hotel chain by rehabbing older buildings and turning them into hotels. although kimpton died in 2001, the company that bears his name still has the reputation he cultivated. most locations welcome guests to mingle at a lobby cocktail hour, lounge in their animal-print robes and bring their pets on their stay. and many locations will lend guests a goldfish as part of the guppy love program. ""i think our guests expect us to push the envelope and try things that are different than what the mass-appeal hotels are doing,"" defrino said. defrino's convinced that some guests don't actually mean to ask for new towels but are much like his teenage daughter, who tosses her towels on the floor at home for no good reason. ""once it's on the floor, you're going to get a clean towel,"" he said. (hotel guests, not his daughter.) the pressure on a mid-priced chain it's trickier for other hotel chains, where sustainability isn't necessarily part of the appeal to the customer. the mid-priced chains are competing for a more price-sensitive business and leisure traveler. hampton inn, which offers a hot breakfast at its nearly 1,900 company-owned and franchise locations across the country, has two environmentally friendly options for disposable plates, bowls and cutlery: 100% biodegradable enviroware or taterware, a resin material made from potato starch. the chain's takeout coffee cup sleeves are made from 100% recycled fiber, and the towel reuse program simply asks customers using a door hanger to ""reuse or replace"" towels. no big deal either way, the sign suggests. ""we're delivering these messages in a light-hearted way. ... it's not preachy or paternalistic,"" said jennifer silberman, vice president of corporate responsibility for hilton worldwide, which owns hampton. more happens behind the scenes at hampton, which benefits from lightstay, hilton's company-wide sustainability system that tracks the sustainability of 200 operational practices at nearly 3,900 properties around the world. hilton has saved more than $147 million since 2008 through efficiency projects, including reporting through lightstay, silberman said. satisfying the luxury guest you'd think environmental sustainability programs would hit a roadblock with luxury guests, who want the best of everything. not so, said sue stephenson, vice president of ritz-carlton's community footprints, the chain's social and environmental responsibility program. ""it in no way diminishes the luxury experience,"" stephenson said. ""we still have the best towels, linens and amenities."" many ritz-carlton guests now use the same sheets two nights in a row (introduced in 2011) and hang up their towels to use another day (introduced in 2009). ""we've not had a single negative guest comment but have certainly had positive guest comments,"" stephenson said. ""guests want to see we're doing the right thing."" it helps that the onus is really on the business to be responsible in its construction, hotel operations, food service and landscaping, she said. ""the majority of what can be done for the environment is what we can do as a business,"" stephenson said. no matter the price point, no hotelier can afford to lose a guest because he or she doesn't like the way a hotel communicates its message. even kimpton's defrino said the boutique chain won't roll out an environmental initiative if tests show that customers don't like it. but in kimpton's case, defrino found that guests approve of their efforts. ""our guest satisfaction has improved since our green initiatives were introduced, and it's given us confidence that efforts have not deteriorated the guest experience,"" he said. the tide may be turning it's possible that younger people used to recycling and saving water will bring those attitudes into their hotel stays as they age. ritz-carlton's stephenson sees children leading their parents into caring about the environment on their hotel stays. betting that more and more consumers want to choose environmentally friendly hotels right now, travel website tripadvisor is launching its greenleaders program this year to let travelers know which hotels have sustainable practices. about 71% of travelers reported that they planned to choose hotels based on sustainability over the next year, compared with 65% in the previous survey, according to an april 2012 trip advisor survey. yet while 81% of hotels have some green programs, almost a quarter don't communicate that fact to their guests, said tripadvisor spokeswoman alison croyle. the website is accepting applications from hotels to qualify for a ""greenleader"" or ""greenpartner"" label on the tripadvisor site based on their sustainable practices. the program will rely on traveler feedback, and any discrepancies could trigger an independent audit of the hotel. that's information that genevieve hein, 33, who always hangs up her towels at hotels to reuse them the next day, would enjoy having. ""trying to limit my impact on the environment makes me feel good,"" said hein, assistant director of residence life at sarah lawrence college in new york. ""when i go against my green principles for the sake of convenience or to go with the flow, i feel bad about myself and guilty. i can't imagine how those feelings would enhance my vacation, which is supposed to be all about feeling good."" do you like to participate in a hotel's sustainable programs, or do they irritate you? please share your thoughts in the comments section below.","hotel guests who ""go green"" are happier with their stay"
"-- when french president francois hollande flew to washington this week for a state visit, he brought along a lot of baggage -- and it's not his country's famous louis vuitton. hollande left france amid sinking popularity ratings and swirling reports that he cheated on his partner of seven years with a younger movie actress â€” making this week's trip something of an escape for the embattled president. the former french first lady valerie trierweiler -- whom obama said in november he was looking forward to hosting -- isn't coming to the white house now that hollande has announced their split. french president's alleged lover nominated for acting award he says his private life is private, but hollande's not denying the affair. now he's in america solo for one of washington's most tradition-bound events, where protocol dictates nearly everything and a slip-up, however unlikely, could wind up offending a top ally. obama and hollande: a strong alliance ""the protocol that dictates how state visits are handled is something that's steeped in hundreds of years of history,"" said anita mcbride, a former chief of staff to laura bush who helped plan state dinners. over time, formal arrival ceremonies and high profile press conferences have become a part of the multi-day affair. finding ways to accommodate foreign leaders, even those with ""it's complicated"" relationship statuses, is just another aspect of the highly choreographed state visit, said people with experience organizing them. it's not the first time a french president has come to washington alone. hollande's predecessor, nicolas sarkozy, attended a formal dinner at the white house shortly after announcing his split from his wife. and at least hollande is showing up; when brazil's president dilma rousseff caught wind of national security agency spying, she canceled altogether. ""there are so many changes that take place, some that are more prominent in the news than others,"" said capricia marshall, who until august was the u.s. chief of protocol. ""you have to be flexible, you have to be prepared, and you just sort of change course."" but questions such as who will sit next to obama are still up in the air. typically the partner of the visiting head of state gets the chair next to america's president. when that position is vacant, u.s. officials must consult their counterparts and even have the president himself weigh in. it's not necessarily a hard task, said mcbride, because plenty of people would jump at the chance to sit next to obama. the designee doesn't have to be french, though it wouldn't be unexpected if he or she is. it's just another piece of planning that requires painstaking attention to detail. ""i'm sure that they will have an imaginative way of doing their seating that's absolutely appropriate,"" said marshall. it may seem antiquated to treat a guest so gingerly, but state dinners have always been about formality and gentle manners. they've grown so much that they no longer fit in the state dining room. instead a sturdy white tent on the south lawn holds the hundreds of invited guests, who usually include some top donors and key allies in congress. this year they'll take trolleys from the white house east wing down to the structure. no detail spared for french president's arrival at the white house once there they'll dine on four courses of american-grown haute cuisine â€” osetra caviar and quail eggs, a winter salad ""served in a wonderful glass bowl to make it look like a terrarium,"" colorado-raised beef, and a chocolate dessert sourced from obama's native hawaii. on monday the white house released the names and vintages of the wines poured at each course â€” a change from the last few state dinners, which listed only ""american"" bottles lest the price tag shock taxpayers. reds from california and washington state, and a sparking wine from virginia, are the selections. none retail for over $50 a bottle. it's a much-sought-after invitation -- so much so that a virginia couple faked one to attend obama's event honoring the indian prime minister, monmohan singh, in 2009. michaele salahi's red-and-gold sari is likely forever imprinted in the mind of desiree rogers, the former white house social secretary who stepped down shortly after the incident. that kind of glaring fissure in the evening's decorum isn't typical, said mcbride, who did recall an incident during a visit by the chinese premier she said was marred when a journalist shouted a question at the formal arrival ceremony. and while the details still matter for staunch allies like france, a slip-up on protocol isn't likely to throw the united states' now-solid relationship with the country into jeopardy. france, to the obama administration's pleasure, has taken a more interventionist stance in global conflicts, a turnaround from the days when americans responded to france's opposition to the iraq invasion with boycotts of french (or just french-sounding) products. ""let's just say that we've come a long way from freedom fries,"" was how one senior administration official described the relationship monday. in libya france took a leading role in the mission that ended with moammar gadhafi's death. and in mali, french troops are working to prevent islamists from taking over in the northern part of the country. france was ready in september to launch air strikes in syria as obama was trying to rally support, making the country one of a few foreign allies to back the u.s. plan after britain's parliament voted against it. obama eventually went to congress for approval, but the issue never came to a vote. while hollande, like most other european leaders, has expressed outrage at allegations of nsa spying, the dust-up isn't likely to make any major dent in french-american relations. the same can be said for what hollande calls ""tax evasion"" by u.s.-based tech firms (after washington, the french president heads to silicon valley). hollande, a socialist elected in 2012, is more closely aligned in policy with obama than the center-right sarkozy. his fluency in english might make him an easier dinner companion than his predecessor, as well as a more conversant travel buddy on the trip to jefferson's monticello the pair took monday. not up for discussion? his love life. opinion: why the french president needs michelle obama french president says it's over; first lady leaves residence french president meets with pope francis amid scandal cnn white house producer matthew hoye contributed to this report.",french president francois hollande's visit comes amid troubles at home

"-- anyone can shake hands. nelson mandela made such a common gesture something transcendent -- a greeting that crossed all societal barriers, a symbol of reconciliation, even a declaration of victory. ""hello! how are you? i'm so happy to see you,"" he would declare in his distinctive tenor, extending a huge right hand befitting the former boxer. before meeting visiting dignitaries or political adversaries in five-star hotel conference rooms, mandela made sure to approach the security guards, servers and other workers outside to shake their hands. at countless rallies of his african national congress, crowds mobbed his path in hopes of a quick clasp from the graying leader. ""i want to put you in my pocket and take you home,"" he would tell them. such was his common touch, a personal warmth and accessibility that delighted adoring supporters and cemented global admiration for the longtime political prisoner who became south africa's first black president. 'our nation has lost its greatest son' to me, a journalist who covered the ""mandela years"" from a few months after his release from prison in 1990 through most of his presidency, he was the closest thing to a messiah i have witnessed, if you define messiah as one who brings hope to the hopeless. tall and trim, his face often beaming an incandescent smile, mandela had his own style expressed in colorful african shirts he wore in lieu of business suits, a teasing rapport with youngsters, and his shoulder-swinging, celebratory dance dubbed the ""madiba shuffle"" in reference to his clan name. leading a transformation wherever he went, people seemed to materialize out of the air -- scampering down alleys and around cars, scrambling over and through fences, even climbing any nearby tree or billboard for a better view. the mood was festive, not frenzied, with crowds singing praise songs in deep-voiced harmonies that elongated the second syllable of his name in an african pronunciation -- mon-day-la. a lawyer of tribal royalty heritage, he possessed an unerring sense of his role as the nation's de facto leader at a time when the anc struggled to evolve from a liberation movement to a full-fledged political party. images of him during those years create an indelible timeline of the nation's transformation from the white rule of apartheid to a multiracial democracy. nelson mandela: the miracle years there was the fist-waving, smiling mandela who walked out of prison in 1990, his every move and word broadcast around the world as well as on national television that once banned black faces. from that moment, the machinations of south african politics changed, and the new order became obvious when the nation's first multiparty political talks began in december 1991. watershed moments opening speeches by mandela and other leaders were generally non-combative policy statements until south african president f. w. de klerk, exercising his privilege to go last, attacked the anc for refusing to disband its armed wing and turn over weapons. visibly furious at de klerk's maneuver, mandela requested an opportunity to respond and the sympathetic moderators agreed. that alone was a shift from the old days. with the meeting hall spellbound, mandela delivered a face-to-face upbraiding of the white president, telling de klerk that ""even a discredited, illegitimate, minority regime must observe certain moral standards."" no one had ever witnessed such a thing in south africa. less visible were his efforts to control radical elements of his anc. at the party's first legal conference in south africa in december 1990, he lectured activists calling for a halt in secret talks between anc leaders and the white government aimed at setting up formal negotiations. ''these statements can only be made by those who do not understand the process of negotiation,"" mandela said in a stern voice. ""... let me take advantage of this opportunity to educate you on the problems that face the leadership.'' after the 1993 assassination of chris hani, a popular communist firebrand considered a possible future anc leader, mandela appeared on state-run national television to urge calm among his black supporters. it was an unprecedented acknowledgement by the white government that the anc leader was the only one who could head off potentially calamitous unrest. ""this is a watershed moment for all of us,"" he said directly to the camera. ""our decisions and actions will determine whether we use our pain, our grief and our outrage to move forward to what is the only lasting solution for our country - an elected government of the people, by the people and for the people."" brazile: nelson mandela's legacy will live on mandela also had a humorous side, even flirtatious at times. at election rallies in 1994, he repeatedly elicited trilling howls of ululation from women of all ages when he explained how voters should search their ballots for the picture of the ""very handsome young man"" -- referring to himself -- to mark their support for the anc. for the lone debate of the campaign between mandela and de klerk, i watched on a communal television at the ywca in soweto to write about the reaction of teenagers in the vast black township. one handshake held a nation spellbound as expected, they cheered each time mandela spoke, but my lasting memory was how these young black south africans seemed transfixed by the mere image of their leader sharing the screen with equal status to the white president. they went wild when mandela concluded his final statement by offering his hand to de klerk as an expression of unity, saying that despite their differences, he was willing to work with his adversary. de klerk had little choice but to grasp it. mandela's handshake could have another meaning. at his divorce trial in 1996, he testified in withering detail how his spouse, the popular activist winnie mandela, never once shared his bed while he was awake after his release from prison. ""the bedroom is where a man and woman discuss the most intimate details,"" mandela told the court. ""there were so many things i wanted to discuss with her, but she is the type of person who fears confrontation. i was the loneliest man during the period i stayed with her."" when he finished, mandela approached his soon to be ex-wife and shook her hand, having destroyed any chance she had of gaining a favorable settlement. i experienced many mandela handshakes, mostly before news conferences or interviews in the usual exchange of pleasantries between political figures and journalists. some are captured in photos that will always be prized possessions. one that was not photographed occurred after a public dressing down from the president at a foreign correspondents association dinner in 1996. during the question period after mandela spoke, i asked about his recent criticism of the south african media as biased against the anc. was he trying to intimidate newspapers, i wondered, or seeking to shift attention from his government's struggle to deliver promised development to poor blacks. in an angry voice, he berated the foreign media for failing to report on what he called unfair treatment the anc received from south african newspapers. ""why are you defending them?"" he asked of the room stunned to silence. as he left the event shortly afterward, he made his way past my table where he stopped and reached out his hand, looking me in the eye. with no words spoken, we exchanged a single, slightly pronounced shake. another victory for his anc secured, he headed to the exit.",before meeting visiting dignitaries mandela made sure to shake hands with workers
"-- after days of international shuttling on what to do with the troubling situation in syria, russia's foreign minister said saturday his country will never agree to foreign intervention. despite warnings of syria spiraling into a civil war, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said at a televised briefing in moscow there was no alternative other than implementing special envoy kofi annan's peace plan, despite its failures. ""the situation looks more and more grim,"" lavrov said. ""for the first time since the beginning of this crisis we see the question of foreign intervention. and our position remains unchanged. we will never agree to sanction the use of force in the u.n. security council."" opinion: the only glimmer of hope for syria he called foreign intervention a ""dangerous game"" and said it would have serious consequences in the entire region. he also blamed the recent violence, which has included horrific reported massacres in houla and qubeir, in part to opposition groups being supported by other nations. russia, along with china and four central asian nations, has signed a joint declaration rejecting armed intervention in syria and reiterating support for annan's peace plan. russia and china -- both security council members -- have also blocked proposed united nations efforts to punish president bashar al-assad's regime with sanctions. lavrov suggested an international conference on syria to work out a way to make the peace plan stick. that conference, he said, should include iran and not focus on regime change in syria. ""if the syrians agree [on assad's departure] between each other, we will only be happy to support such a solution,"" lavrov said. ""but we believe it is unacceptable to impose the conditions for such a dialogue from outside."" lavrov's comments came on a day when intense fighting flared across syria and after many hours of international discussions this week on how to get the failing peace plan back on track. at least 96 people, including many women and children, were killed saturday, said the opposition local coordination committees of syria. many of the reported deaths were in daraa, a southern city near the jordanian border that the opposition group said was raided and shelled starting friday night. ""several doctors have been detained to prevent them from aiding the wounded amid a state of panic among residents due to the abuses regime forces are committing against the people there,"" the group said. a doctor in the besieged city of al qusayr, near the lebanese border, said he has to keep moving his makeshift hospital to prevent attack. journalist robert king documented the chaos in the hospital on video as medical staff rushed to save lives. king said he has seen snipers targeting children. the city of homs came under heavy bombardment saturday. regime forces stormed one neighborhood amid intense gunfire and shelled a mosque and church, the local coordination committees said. at least 26 people died in homs, including the mayor of the khalidiya neighborhood, according to the group. it said another 26 people died in idlib. another opposition group, the london-based syrian observatory for human rights, reported a total of 17 government forces were killed in clashes with rebels across the country. cnn cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or violence as the syrian government has restricted access by international journalists. in another sign of escalating attacks, rebels battled government forces in the heart of damascus on friday, sparking fierce explosions in a rare and bold move for the fighters, video purportedly from the scene showed. meanwhile, the syrian government said an ""armed terrorist group"" was behind an attack on a power station in a damascus neighborhood friday. firefighters extinguished the fire and crews are working to restore electricity to affected areas. the state-run syrian arab news agency (sana) reported that the bodies of 57 policemen and soldiers -- many of them officers -- were transported from military hospitals in several cities to funerals in hometowns. international leaders accuse al-assad of failing to comply with a peace plan brokered by annan, a special envoy on syria for the united nations and the arab league. annan, who has been meeting with u.n. officials, is trying to salvage the peace plan to end the 15-month anti-government uprising. as part of the plan, u.n. observers have been in syria to monitor whether both sides are abiding by the agreement. friday, the observers made it to the site of what the opposition called a massacre wednesday in the village of qubeir, near hama, after they were denied access a day earlier by government forces and civilians in the area, said sausan ghosheh, spokeswoman for the u.n. supervision mission in syria. the u.n. team found signs of an attack in the village, including some homes damaged by rockets, grenades and a range of other weapons, ghosheh said. there also were tracks left by armored fighting vehicles that were visible in the vicinity, she said. the observers found the village empty, and observers were not able to talk to anyone who witnessed wednesday's ""horrific tragedy,"" ghosheh said. she said the circumstances surrounding this attack are still unclear, and that the number and names of those killed are still unconfirmed. the lcc alleges at least 78 people were killed in qubeir, while the syrian government blamed terrorists for the attack that it says killed only nine people. the syrian state news agency discounted the opposition account of what happened in qubeir, citing in its report a witness from the village who claimed to have seen armed terrorist groups carry out the attack. the government's claim contradicts that of the opposition, who accused government forces of shelling the village for an hour before militias on foot turned ak-47 rifles on people, some at close range, or slashed them with knives. some residents suspected the shabiha, armed gangs that work as freelancers for the government, the opposition said. a video purporting to show the carnage was posted on youtube. it did not show who carried out the actual killings. cnn could not independently verify its authenticity. cnn's hamdi alkhshali and saad abedine contributed to this report.",new: an opposition group reports 96 people killed across syria on saturday
"(health.com) -- between puffs of his cigarette, aristo lizica explains why he's all for a smoking ban in public housing -- including his own housing project on the upper west side of manhattan. ""when you smoke indoors, it hurts everybody,"" the 59-year-old says, leaning against an iron fence outside his building. ""it's better for me to just make myself sick."" lizica would prefer to avoid making himself sick too, of course. ""i want to quit,"" he adds. ""i know cigarettes are bad for my health."" yet he remains unable to kick the habit. federal housing officials are trying to help people like lizica -- and his neighbors -- by making public housing smoke-free. full or partial smoking bans would reduce secondhand smoke drifting between apartments, prevent cigarette-related fires, and even help smokers quit, they argue. ""we see it as a win-win for both residents and housing authorities,"" says donna white, a spokesperson for the u.s. department of housing and urban development, the federal agency that oversees public housing. 15 ways smoking ruins your looks in a 2009 memo, the department highlighted the dangers that indoor smoking poses to the nation's 2.1 million public housing residents, and ""strongly encouraged"" local housing authorities to implement smoking restrictions. but doing so remains voluntary, and so far only about 4 percent of local authorities have taken the step. ""change is hard,"" white says. public health experts are hoping to light a fire under the cause. in a paper published today in the new england journal of medicine, a team of researchers and attorneys from harvard university argue that the health and safety gains of a smoking ban in housing projects would far outweigh the losses, which some say would include the privacy rights of smokers. yet smokers like lizica could prove to be the biggest winners, the authors suggest. ""if federal officials and public housing authorities take this cue, we can expect to have large numbers of people quit smoking,"" says the lead author of the article, jonathan winickoff, m.d., a pediatrician and assistant professor at harvard medical school, in boston. ""that could be the single greatest health benefit."" although the exact numbers of smokers in housing projects are unknown, about 30 percent of americans living below the poverty line smoke tobacco, more than 1.5 times the rate of those who live above it. 70 years of menthol cigarette ads the idea that the government can tell people what to do in their own homes is controversial, however. as winickoff and his colleagues acknowledge, the smoking restrictions they support are ""morally offensive to some"" because the restrictions would be imposed on residents who are poor and unable to easily relocate if they disagree with them. indeed, not all residents of public housing support the idea. ""i do want to quit, but at the end of the day, we shouldn't care what others do,"" says esther matos, 29, who lives and smokes in lizica's housing project. ""don't bother me, and i won't bother them."" even nonsmoker lizzie middleton, a 65-year-old survivor of lung and colon cancer, agrees. ""it may be public housing, but people still pay rent and bills and buy their own cigarettes,"" she says. ""they have the right to smoke in their own home."" but hud officials and the harvard researchers argue that smokers such as matos are, in fact, bothering their neighbors and harming the health of those around them. secondhand smoke and third-hand smoke -- the toxic residue left behind on walls, carpets, and clothes long after a cigarette is extinguished -- are bad news, especially for children, pregnant women, people with chronic illnesses, and the elderly, winickoff and his colleagues note. these vulnerable groups are disproportionately represented in public housing, they point out, and may be at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, respiratory infections, heart attacks, and cancer. 6 common smoking triggers -- and how to fight them just a few smokers can cause a big impact in a large apartment building, winickoff says. ""tobacco smoke can stick around for weeks, months, even years,"" he explains. ""smoke doesn't know to stop at a doorway. it travels through air vents and cracks in walls, along ventilation and elevator shafts, and up stairways."" smoking bans might also reduce the number of smokers and prevent young people from starting in the first place, says michelle mello, ph.d., a professor of health policy and management at the harvard school of public health, and one of winickoff's co-authors. ""if we can remove the constant exposure to this behavior as well as to the smoke itself, we also stand a better chance of keeping at-risk youth from beginning to smoke,"" mello says. 10 crazy ways smokers finally kicked the habit even proponents acknowledge that smoking restrictions could prove difficult to enforce, however. mello believes that smoking could be regulated in public housing in the same way that drugs and alcohol are, but she and her co-authors note that penalties -- including eviction- may be hard to impose. although cities such as boston, seattle, and denver have begun to roll out smoking bans in recent years, most of the cities and towns that have implemented restrictions to date are small and have relatively few housing projects. social, sneaky, or skinny? the 7 types of smokers milford, connecticut, is one of the few cities that have responded to hud's urging. in march, the city's public housing authority passed a nonsmoking ordinance that covers all 465 of its units.

"less than a week after dissolving the parliament, jordan's king abdullah ii appointed a new prime minister wednesday as the country deals with demands for political reform. abdullah ensour, the new prime minister, is tasked with forming a new government -- jordan's fifth in two years. he was appointed after king abdullah accepted the resignation of outgoing prime minister fayez al-tarawneh, the country's royal court said. last week, thousands of peaceful protesters gathered in amman to call for constitutional reforms, saying the king has too much power. they demanded that representatives be able to run for election in a democratic system rather than be under his control. king abdullah has also called for early elections, close to the new year. there is no clear deadline for establishing a new government, former parliamentarian khaled kalaldeh said. but he said it's in the prime minister's best interest to set up the new administration within 24 hours, due to a planned demonstration friday by the opposition and the muslim brotherhood. many have said jordan's economy is hurting, and too many people cannot afford the high cost of living and are burdened by high inflation. unemployment numbers are too high, they said, and many young people are without work. the complaints have been echoed for some time in the kingdom, and gained steam when the arab spring began to sweep north africa and the middle east in 2010 and 2011. popular uprisings in tunisia, egypt and libya have ousted longtime leaders from power. in the past two years, king abdullah has fired four prime ministers. in february 2011, shortly before egyptian president hosni mubarak was forced out of office following weeks of intense protest, the king dismissed his government and ordered ""genuine political reform,"" the country's royal court reported. but the king appears to be in a tough spot. political reforms would mean taking power away from his base -- the bedouin tribes, a group known as the east bankers. on top of that concern, king abdullah is also dealing with more than 200,000 syrian refugees who have entered jordan recently. last thursday, government spokesman samih al-maitah framed the king's decision to dissolve parliament as part of his promised reforms. ""this was not a surprise decision,"" al-maitah said. he added that an independent commission to oversee upcoming parliamentary elections will ensure fairness. but the dissolution of parliament didn't stop the mass protest on friday, which was organized by the muslim brotherhood. the religious and political group believes islam is not simply a religion but a way of life. it advocates a move away from secularism and a return to the rules of the quran as a basis for healthy families, communities and states. the brotherhood has repeatedly called for political reform in jordan. on wednesday, a member of the muslim brotherhood's political wing expressed hope for the new government. ""as far as we are concerned, we have no enmity toward any jordanian person appointed by the king, especially for the appointment of the prime minister,"" said nimer assaf, deputy general secretary for the islamic action front. ""we do not look for names, we look for the deeds, and we hope that this next government will go ahead with reforms which the jordanians have been asking for a very long time.""",abdullah ensour is jordan's new prime minister

"-- the ""mommy wars"" that have cropped up repeatedly this campaign season are a figment of political pundits' imagination. the most recent example, of course, was the political and media tempest that followed democratic strategist hilary rosen's comment that ann romney, mitt romney's wife and a mother of five, had not ""worked a day in her life."" many made political hay with the remark. the truth is most women aren't fighting about this. they know that work is involved to make everyday life happen: the feeding, and clothing and caring for oneself and one's family, whether earning the money to buy the clothes and food, or being at home, washing those clothes or cooking dinner. all mothers work, nearly all of the time. and so do many fathers. but there is a serious issue hidden in the silliness of the alleged mommy wars, and it is the contradictory, conflicting beliefs we have about the value of taking time to care for other people. who should take care of young people and their grandparents, and how should they be rewarded? we claim to value families, but we don't really value what it takes to care for them. let me give you some examples: contradiction #1: everyone seems to agree that women and men should have equal rights. but when was the last time you heard someone say that a man should make fatherhood a ""career""? it is true today that sometimes, men do become stay-at-home dads, but even in the consciously feminist families i wrote about in my book, ""gender vertigo,"" men share the ""work"" of raising their children; i didn't interview one man who described fatherhood as a career. and it took me a long time to find couples that really shared the work equally. there are blogs to help parents equally share the work (like marc and amy vachon's blog), but if parenting is truly the socially valued career choice that politicians on both sides of the political spectrum claim, why do so few men identify fatherhood as their primary career? contradiction #2: everyone seems to agree that parenting involves sophisticated emotional and psychological skills and not merely grunt work. but if people truly believe that, why does stanford sociologist shelley correll and her colleagues find time and time again that mothers are discriminated against in hiring and promotions? contradiction #3: everyone seems to agree that america supports ""family values."" but research published in this month's american sociological review shows that women who breast-feed for six months or more pay a mommy penalty in wages for the rest of their lives because of the lack of work policies that protect employed women's right to breast-feed on the job. why doesn't the u.s. institute the same protections for women's right to breast-feed as other western industrial countries? contradiction #4: everyone seems to agree that when women married to men of means choose to be stay-at-home moms, they are doing so for the good of their children. but when poor women, without access to first-rate child care, choose to stay home with their babies, we tend to call them lazy welfare mothers. our social policy of providing only very ""temporary assistance to needy families"" comes with the built-in insistence that they take personal responsibility for their children, meaning they should get themselves a low-wage job, often with no choice but to leave their children in less than optimal child care. sociologist mirra komarovsky pointed out these contradictions back in 1953. she argued back then that if society truly believed caretaking was an important and difficult job, nursery school teachers would rate a salary at least equal to the beginning salary of a street cleaner. not much has changed since then. as stephanie coontz, a historian and co-chair of the council on contemporary families, told me: ""it's time for politicians to stop competing over the women's votes and start competing over who has the best programs to support all parents, whatever their employment status or their gender."" why all these contradictions? because we have a society in flux. we have inherited both workplace cultures and beliefs from a time in our past when successful men had wives to take care of their homes and children. workplaces got two employees for the price of one, the husband and his domestic wife. unions fought for ""family wages"" so working-class men could benefit from women's household work as well. that's not the world we live in today. now, for better or worse, most mothers of young children -- married and single -- work both inside and outside their homes. their workplaces, and our cultural conversation full of contradictions, has lagged far behind. let's call a truce on the fictional mommy wars and start a war on workplaces that don't allow mommies and daddies to live full lives, on the job and at home. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of barbara j. risman.","barbara risman: ""mommy wars"" are cooked up by politicians and media, not everyday women"
"-- a young woman whisked away by syrian security forces to coax the surrender of her activist brother turned up beheaded and dismembered, activists and human rights groups say, yet another high-profile display of cruelty in the conflict-wracked nation. nineteen-year-old zainab alhusni stepped away from her homs residence last month to buy groceries. her family never saw her again until security forces returned her mutilated corpse, two opposition activist groups operating inside syria and amnesty international told cnn. as reports of the torture sparked outrage across homs and the rest of the world, amateur video surfaced of dozens of woman protesting the death. ""they killed the rose zainab,"" their placards said. ""if it is confirmed that zainab was in custody when she died, this would be one of the most disturbing cases of a death in detention we have seen so far,"" said philip luther, amnesty's deputy director for the middle east and north africa. the case also drew the antipathy of the u.n. office of the high commissioner for human rights, which characterized the incident as ""appalling"" and as one example of the ""targeting and attacking of families and sympathizers of the protesters by security forces."" the ferocious syrian government crackdown against dissenters began in mid-march when anti-government protests unfolded. the number of people killed over the past six months has reached at least 2,700, according to the u.n. human rights office. some activist groups put the toll at around 3,000. zainab's brother mohammed alhusni -- a prominent opposition activist praised by colleagues for leading anti-government protests and treating the wounded -- had been evading authorities for weeks when his sister disappeared, said the homs quarters union, an activist group. ""the secret police kidnapped zainab so they could threaten her brother and pressure him to turn himself in to the authorities. the government often uses this tactic to get to activists,"" a union media coordinator told cnn. the local coordination committees of syria, an activist group, said security forces called zainab's family to trade her ""freedom for her pro-democracy activist brother's surrender,"" lcc said. mohammed alhusni was eventually slain on september 10, when security forces fired on demonstrators in homs. when the family retrieved mohammed's body from a homs military hospital, medical officials told relatives about another unclaimed body with the label ""zainab alhusni"" that had been kept in a hospital freezer for some time. days later, zainab's family received the woman's headless and limbless corpse, the syrian observatory for human rights, amnesty international and the homs quarters union said. the homs quarters union provided a video to cnn showing the pale trunk of a female body beside a detached head with long black hair among dismembered limbs. authorities forced zainab's mother to sign a document saying both zainab and mohammad had been kidnapped and killed by an armed gang, amnesty international said in an online statement. syrian authorities could not be reached for comment on the alhusni case. the syrian government has maintained that armed gangs with foreign agendas, not the regime, are responsible for the violence that has plagued the arab country for months. cnn cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, the claims, or the death toll because the government has repeatedly denied requests for journalists to report inside syria.","""they killed the rose zainab,"" protesters' placards say"

"(lifewire) -- first comes love, then comes marriage -- or at least that's how the saying used to go. an increasing number of heterosexual couples have been shacking up without plans for a trip down the aisle. angelina jolie and brad pitt are raising four children together. pitt has said the couple won't consider marriage until same-sex couples have the right to wed. according to a 2003 u.s. census bureau report on families and living arrangements, 4.6 million u.s. households were occupied by unmarried couples of the opposite sex. that's up from 2.9 million in 1996. ""people don't question, 'why did you get married?' they only ask you, 'why haven't you gotten married?' "" points out marion willetts, an associate professor of sociology at illinois state university. ""i think a lot of people feel if you were really serious about your partner and your relationship, then you'd get married."" but from what willetts has found with the life partners she's spoken to, that is simply not true. ""they're in this for the long haul,"" she says. ""this isn't just some convenient thing or trial marriage. they're just as committed to their relationship as married people."" while census data doesn't identify couples who have sworn off marriage, willetts has followed this group in a study of 83 couples she's surveyed over the past few years for her current research, tentatively titled ""union quality comparisons between heterosexual licensed domestic partners and the legally married."" according to her research, it's not just 20-something social idealists who decline to get married. willetts has interviewed octogenarians in committed relationships who are not planning to tie the knot. in fact, according to a 2003 aarp survey of 3,500 single americans aged 40-69, just eight percent cited finding someone to marry as their reason for dating, while 49 percent said they were looking for someone to talk with or do things with -- in other words, a companion. as the prevalence of unmarried couples rises, more companies and state and local governments are providing a range of domestic partner benefits. some, like new york state, require that medical benefits be extended to both same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners, according to the human rights campaign foundation. other states, like illinois extend such benefits only to same-sex partners. why do some couples opt for long-term companionship instead of legal marriage, like movie actors goldie hawn and kurt russell, who have been together since 1982? alison hatch, 30, a part-time instructor and doctoral candidate in sociology at the university of colorado at boulder, and daniel welch, 31, an elementary school teacher, cite reasons both social and political. ""we are philosophically opposed to marriage for a few reasons, but mostly because we do not feel as though we can in good conscience enter into an institution that actively discriminates against gay and lesbian couples,"" says hatch, who has lived with welch for four years. ""it is our belief that it is inherently discriminatory to grant social benefits to some couples and exclude others."" actor brad pitt told esquire magazine in october 2006 that he and actress angelina jolie -- with whom he is raising four children -- have declined to consider marriage until same-sex couples have the right to wed. partners choose not to marry for other reasons. hatch, whose dissertation examined 48 committed heterosexual couples choosing to not pursue legal marriage, has spoken to people who feel marriage is a patriarchal institution. some are against the intertwining of church and state in marriage. there also are emotional reasons why committed couples choose to stay unwed. ""i think that a lot of people like the kind of organic nature that your relationship takes on when you decide not to marry,"" says julie bluhm, 31, a minneapolis, minnesota-based clinical social worker and a board member of the alternatives to marriage project, a national nonprofit organization advocating equality for unmarried people. ""it's almost a deeper appreciation of their relationship and the privacy of it."" being unmarried was not necessarily an obstacle to parenting for a small group of couples in willetts' research. in a study published in the journal of marriage and family in november 2003, two of 23 couples willetts surveyed had children biologically related to both partners, though several couples had children biologically related to one partner -- typically the result of a previous marriage. of the two couples, one pair had been living together for over 15 years and did not encounter any legal issues concerning their children by not being married. said willetts, ""they expressed to me that everyone -- including their children's friends -- had just assumed they were legally married anyway."" e-mail to a friend lifewire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to web publishers. jocelyn voo is a freelance journalist and relationships editor at the new york post.",it's not just 20-something social idealists who decline to get married
"editor's note: cnn writer alan duke has had two small voice-only roles in tyler perry's tv series, ""house of payne,"" which airs on cnn's sister network tbs. he has had no relationship with perry beyond observing him on set. tyler perry stars in ""madea goes to jail,"" which is due out friday. perry is trying to expand his reach to europe. -- tyler perry wants to take his character madea to europe, but he's been told that audiences there won't relate to his stories about african-american lives. the films have made nearly $300 million at u.s. box offices. the challenge to conquer europe has ""sat in my spirit,"" perry wrote in a newsletter to his fans. perry, who just a few years ago was homeless and broke, has made a fortune proving naysayers and critics wrong with a successful string of low-budget movies based on his christian-themed stage plays. ""i was once told [by] someone that my movies only appeal to black people and no one else,"" perry wrote. ""now, i know that's not true."" when his first movie -- ""diary of a mad black woman"" -- debuted in 2005, people who had seen his stage plays in person or on dvd flocked to theaters, making it the week's top movie with almost $22 million in ticket sales. critics, who consistently pan perry's productions, were confounded. ""they think i don't know what i am doing,"" he said in a cnn interview. ""they think that this is all haphazard, that i am some sort of idiot or something."" watch perry sound off on ""madea"" and other topics » perry said he does not write to please the critics, but for a broad audience of all ages. with six films already out and a seventh -- ""madea goes to jail"" -- coming soon, perry has never made a box office flop. his movies average nearly $22 million on opening weekends and almost $47 million in total domestic sales. ""tyler perry has a definite and growing fan base in this country and it's simply a matter of, can he create and grow a fan base in other countries,"" said independent producer alex franklin. franklin -- a former development executive at lionsgate, the film company that distributes perry's films in the united states -- was the first person at that studio to read his script for ""diary of a mad black woman."" he agrees that perry's movies should sell in europe, but he said there is a tendency by distributors there to avoid films about african-americans and films without major american stars who are well-known in europe. while perry's casts have included angela bassett, janet jackson and kathy bates, many of his characters, including madea, come from his stage plays, which are known only to a mostly black american audience. but david mann -- who is ""mr. brown"" in perry's productions -- said he has seen the audience broaden since the early years of the stage plays. ""i can recall when we first started, i would say 90 to 95 percent of the audience would be african-american,"" mann said. ""but now, you look out there and it's like, 'wow! it's just a rainbow.' "" perry, in his message to fans, said he sees his stories as universal. ""i know that even though i write from an african-american experience and most of the time i have an all-african-american cast, that doesn't mean that other people from other walks of life can't relate,"" he said. ""i think that any human being who goes through what we all go through can relate to my films. ""i know and remember that when i'm writing,"" he continued. ""but when this person said that to me, they also said europeans would never relate, and that sat in my spirit."" perry said he flew to europe in january -- ""to find out for myself"" -- with visits to rome, madrid and london. it was there that he wrote his letter to his american fans. ""so far, all of us seem to be pretty much the same,"" he said. ""we love to laugh, we all have problems, we all want love, and we all have a church in every country. and since these are the things i usually write about, i don't see how that statement can be true. do you?"" perry could get his answer soon. lionsgate has not said if ""madea goes to jail,"" which debuts friday, will be marketed to european audiences. but the company signed a joint venture deal last year with eros international, an indian film company, to distribute its films in india -- the second largest english-speaking market in the world. if that arrangement does not take madea around the world, then perhaps perry will try it on his own, franklin said. ""he has the money to back up his intentions,"" he said. ""he proved his naysayers wrong in america, with his will and perseverance. there's no reason he can't do the same overseas."" cnn's kara yates and kj matthews contributed to this report.",tyler perry hoping to find market for his films in europe

"-- in one of the clinics in arsal, a young fighter asks that we conceal his identity, going simply by the name ahmed. three years ago, when syria's revolution had not yet morphed into the brutal war it is today, the 20-year-old was still in high school. his ambition in life was to be a doctor, but a year-and-a-half ago that all changed. ""we reached a point where if we don't fight, we will get killed, it was the only option,"" ahmed tells us, one hand rubbing against the bandages swathed around his waist. ""if i don't fight for my country then who is going to?"" ahmed was wounded during the fighting for the town of yabroud, just across the border. ""it's a strategic area, it's a main access route to get the wounded out and the medical and other aid in,"" dr. kasem zein explains, as he checks ahmed's wounds. pleas for mercy in pre-revolution syria dr. zein was a gastroenterologist, hardly equipped to deal with war wounds ranging from bullets to severed limbs. the doctor is a familiar face, known to us in the media and the world from countless youtube videos during the fighting for the town of qusair. often overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of casualties dr. zein would broadcast impassioned pleas for mercy, for help, but none came. he spent more than two years apart from this family. over the summer when qusair, due to an influx of hardened hezbollah fighters fell back to the regime, dr. zein fled to lebanon. ""it's not just a war with weapons -- it's a war on our soul, our psyche,"" he says. ""it's all death, but at least here it is slightly more gentle."" increasing tensions arsal was once a sleepy border town tucked amidst the mountainous terrain of lebanon's eastern frontier with syria. the flow of syrian refugees has seen the town's population roughly triple, makeshift camps seeping into any open space or empty lot. lebanon hit the one million registered syrian refugee mark last week. the number is on track to hit 1.5 million, according to the un. this in a country whose own population is 4.4 million. aid agencies can offer little. the united nations' refugee agency, the unhcr, says it only has $242 million of the $1.89 billion needed just for the syrian refugee crisis in lebanon alone. some towns house more syrians than lebanese, and while many lebanese sympathize with the plight of the syrians, the strain being put on this tiny nation is unsustainable and tensions are increasing. lives forever scarred arsal finds itself in the crosshairs of the syrian war, a sunni enclave in lebanon's shi'a bekka valley -- hezbollah's stronghold. hezbollah dispatched its fighters to battle alongside the assad regime, its hardened fighters allowing the syrian government to reclaim key towns and territory close to the lebanese border, choking-off key supply lines for the rebels, and sending masses streaming into lebanon. lives lost, lives forever scarred, a population that hardly recognizes its homeland or in many cases even itself, thrown into the midst of unimaginable violence, adapting to survive. in one of the newest refugee camps on the outskirts of arsal, under a rusty ferris wheel, the youngest residents dart through large chunks of limestone. the men gather around us, angry, desperate, frustrated.

"-- a federal judge declared a mistrial monday in the case of two u.s. security contractors accused of killing two afghanistan civilians. the jury in the case against christopher drotleff and justin cannon told judge robert doumar that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. a retrial has been scheduled for march 1, 2011. drotleff and cannon worked as security contractors for a subsidiary of xe, the military contracting firm formerly known as blackwater worldwide. each were charged with two counts of second-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in connection with a may 2009 shooting in kabul, afghanistan. the 12-count, 19-page indictment returned by a federal grand jury in u.s. district court for the eastern district of virginia also included weapons charges against the two men. trey robert kelleter, the attorney for drotleff, expressed disappointment with monday's mistrial declaration in the federal court in norfolk, virginia. ""we thought the evidence showed chris had acted in self defense,"" kelleter said. ""it is a real hardship on his family."" kelleter said his client remained in custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for wednesday. according to kelleter, a retrial is likely because of the deadlocked jury. peter carr, the spokesman for the u.s. attorney's office, declined to comment. both drotleff and cannon were in afghanistan working for the security company paravant -- a subsidiary of xe -- to help the u.s. army train afghan troops. drotleff, cannon and two other contractors, steven mcclain and armando hamid, were driving their interpreters on a busy kabul street called jalalabad road on may 5, 2009, when they said a car slammed into one of their two cars. the men said they got out to help their colleagues, and the vehicle that had struck the car did a u-turn and headed back at them. the contractors said they fired at the oncoming vehicle in self-defense. the incident spotlights the issue of the role and conduct of u.s. security contractors in afghanistan. a similar issue arose in iraq after a september 2007 confrontation involving then-blackwater contractors that left 17 iraqi civilians dead. blackwater lost its contract there after iraq's government refused to renew its operating license. the company then changed its name to xe, and it continues to receive multimillion-dollar contracts in afghanistan.",new: defense attorney says a retrial is likely

""he got pretty overweight in the fourth grade, and i got chubby in the seventh,"" mickey recalled. but the real weight gain began after high school. the couple started a long-distance relationship when mickey went to lock haven university in their home state of pennsylvania and balajthy attended the university of maryland. ""it sucked,"" mickey said. ""i was lonely in college, and i missed him. so there was a lot of emotional eating."" having a college meal plan also didn't help. mickey feasted on buffet-style meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. ""it was very much a serve-yourself pasta bar, make-your-own pizza dining hall, and breakfasts were always make-your-own waffles, topped off with everything terrible."" at his campus, balajthy also developed bad eating habits such as finishing off a box of entenmann's pastries in one sitting. he periodically ate calorie-dense dishes such as his favorite meal: pasta with vodka sauce. ""i was on track to some serious health issues,"" balajthy said. ""first, being heavy takes a toll on your body. my back always hurt, and i couldn't do much because i was always hurting. it doesn't take much to get diabetes and heart disease."" from freshman year to the end of college, mickey's pant size stretched from a size 12 to 18, her largest fit. at graduation, she weighed 235 pounds, standing at 5 feet 7 inches; balajthy was 325 pounds at 5 feet 8 inches. the couple got a place together shortly after graduation. they didn't fully acknowledge how big they had gotten, but their families started giving them subtle hints to lose weight. ""weight is a touchy subject to address,"" mickey said. ""jon's mom sent him a care package with an exercise ball in it. she didn't tell me to lose weight because i am not her daughter, but i know she wanted me to be healthy."" once mickey enrolled in nursing school at marymount university in arlington, virginia, she couldn't ignore their weight any longer, especially after learning about diabetes, heart disease and obesity the first semester. she practiced measuring blood pressure at home and tested balajthy, only to discover he had hypertension. that's when the eating out, snack foods and indulgent meals stopped, and the couple of eight years seriously looked into getting fit. mickey dumped all the calorie-rich food in their kitchen in a trash bag. ""i threw out the full-fat ice cream, chips, cookies, just everything in the house. even the old halloween candy,"" she said. deciding to work out together, the two went jogging for one mile around a lake near their home. ""we were so out of shape at first that we usually had to walk around it,"" mickey recalled. but the exhaustion only inspired them to stick with their goals. they enrolled at planet fitness, a gym near home. for the first three months, all they did was cardio, exercising on machines such as the elliptical and treadmill for half an hour. they also started calorie counting. in the first month, mickey dropped 10 pounds -- an instant boost of confidence. ""i never tried to run or go to the gym until we started losing weight together,"" she said. balajthy agreed. ""it's amazing how easy it was after we started. i realized i liked going to the gym, and there was never a time that i thought, 'i'm having a miserable time.' "" within three months, the duo had lost enough weight to make a big impression at a family reunion in pennsylvania. some relatives hadn't seen them since college graduation. ""we didn't tell anyone that we started to work out,"" mickey said. ""so the reactions were intense and funny because we saw our family with 50 pounds less on us."" for the first time, mickey dared to wear a bikini. ""even when i was little i had to wear tankinis,"" she said. now people called her the ""ever-shrinking woman."" after eight months, mickey and balajthy are down to 145 and 195 pounds, respectively. their workouts have changed, too; they do 30 minutes of cardio and 30 minutes of weight training four to five times a week. they're working on toning up and being active, which means fitness doesn't stop at the gym. balajthy bikes to the university of maryland, where he is a doctoral candidate in physics. the couple take their dog on runs or play tennis in the evenings. on the weekends, they go on hiking trips, excursions mickey always dreamed of doing when she was heavier. now they're hiking 20 miles while carrying 40-pound packs. staying active has been a plus for balajthy, who said he's always been a boredom eater. ""i would watch tv with a bag of chips and finish it off."" there are no chips at home anymore. besides counting calories, the pair started cooking more. their dinners usually consist of skinless chicken breasts or fish with a veggie side such as broccoli or green beans and a salad. ""we even use yogurt dressing and don't have a lot of carbohydrates for dinner,"" mickey said. ""jon's mother used to serve dinner rolls, but we don't eat bread and butter anymore because there are a million little things you can do to keep the weight off."" they enjoy eating out though and occasionally treat themselves to thai, a favorite for balajthy. in the end, the couple said there were no hidden secrets to losing weight. ""if you just go outside and do little things, like exercise and eating healthy, it works,"" mickey said. but they said the key was working out together. ""working out with caroline has kept me on track. i wasn't driven to lose weight and didn't think i could,"" balajthy said. now they are happy with their weight, mickey said she is looking forward to trying on wedding dresses and starting their life together as a married couple. have you lost weight? submit your story to ireport.","caroline mickey and jon balajthy dropped 90 and 130 pounds, respectively"

"-- in a field largely still in its infancy, scientists are making headway toward using stem cells to treat heart ailments. the fda regulates which adult stem cell techniques are allowed to go into clinical trials. the major focus of stem cell research in cardiology is promoting regeneration of the heart or preventing scar formation, said jeffrey karp, who runs a stem cell biology lab at harvard university. one study reporting successful results in humans involves harvesting patients' own stem cells, purifying them, and injecting them directly into the heart muscle. the stem cells have a surface marker called cd34, which means they are capable of growing new blood vessels. the study, sponsored by baxter inc., is the largest adult stem cell study for heart disease in the u.s., said dr. douglas losordo, cardiologist at northwestern memorial hospital in chicago, illinois, who is leading the trial. the researchers will present their one-year findings from phase ii of the trial in september, losordo said. ""it's important to point out that this is a use of a patient's own body's repair capabilities,"" losordo said. if everything goes well, it's conceivable this treatment could be widely available in a little over four years, he said. the target patient population, consisting of end-stage cardiac patients who have tried all other available therapies, is about 300,000 to 900,000 people, he said. so far, researchers have not found side effects from this method, losordo said. however, because it is an invasive surgical procedure in which stem cells are delivered through a catheter, there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent, he said. there is also a small risk of blood clotting from the drug, gcsf, which mobilizes stem cells. injecting stem cells into the heart muscle carries the risk of arrhythmia, said techung lee, associate professor of biochemistry at the state university new york at buffalo. but losordo said this risk is theoretical in his trial, and is believed to be very low with cd34 cells in general. lee and colleagues are working on a less-invasive technique. in a study in mice, they injected stem cells from bone marrow into skeletal muscles of limbs. they found that the stem cells produced growth factors that traveled to the heart, in addition to stimulating the muscle itself to make growth factors that also improved cardiac function. the challenge for translating this method to humans would be that, while each mouse needed only a few million stem cells, each human patient would need close to a billion stem cells for the therapy -- which would be far too expensive and logistically difficult. ""this is a problem that's been experienced by everyone in the field,"" lee said. he estimates that his method could be available clinically in five years, after researchers find ways to reduce the required number of cells by a factor of 10 or even 100. another therapeutic possibility is giving a patient an iv of stem cells, which would come from a stem cell bank or a company. the challenge is that the cells may not have the right homing receptors to land in the heart, karp said. karp's group is working on an approach to chemically modify the surface of cells to enhance their targeting to specific sites. results from animal models have shown promising results for targeting sites of inflammation, he said. ""essentially we know the zip code of vessels within a certain tissue, we can program the address on the surface of the cell,"" he said. lee's and karp's teams use adult mesenchymal stem cells, which may develop into connective tissue, lymphatic tissue, and blood vessels. these stem cells are largely interchangeable between patients and don't require matching, as organ transplants do. however, as more becomes known about the relatively new field of stem cell therapy, a more specific matching system may be required, said dr. joon lee, cardiologist at the university of pittsburgh medical center. some stem cell therapies for the heart are being tested in human clinical trials. osiris therapeutics inc. is enrolling patients in a phase ii trial for prochymal, which contains mesenchymal stem cells. the company intends to use this drug, which gets injected into the vein, to repair heart damage in patients who have just experienced their first heart attack. more than 90 percent of research on using stem cells to repair the human heart involves adult stem cells, lee said. that means the controversy about using stem cells derived from human embryos is largely absent from this line of research. for developing treatments that involve transplanting stem cells from adults, there is no ethical concern about the use of embryos, lee said. embryonic stem cells are advantageous in research because they can be grown more easily than adult stem cells in a culture, and are pluripotent, meaning they can develop into any of the various cell types of the body, according to the national institutes of health. but it is not yet known whether tissues derived from embryonic stem cells would cause transplant rejection, whereas this does not seem to be a problem with adult stem cells. the u.s. food and drug administration regulates which adult stem cell techniques are allowed to go into clinical trials and sets the requirements for more routine use. whether the fda will become more or less lenient in these respects is unclear, lee said. it's not unfathomable that within the next two to five years, some fda-approved stem cell treatments will be available for cardiovascular disease, lee said. karp has a longer view -- five to 10 years before stem cell treatments become widely available for heart problems, he said. the biology of stem cell treatments for the heart is not well understood, said dr. ronald crystal, chief of the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at new york-presbyterian hospital/weill cornell medical center. one of the challenges is that once a stem cell gets put into a person's body, no one can get it out, crystal said. this is the opposite of other kinds of medications -- for instance, a person may get sick from taking too many aspirin, but eventually the drug leaves the system. not so with stem cells, he said. crystal expressed general caution about the future of stem cell research, which is still experimental, for heart patients. ""this is a good idea, but patients and families should not expect immediate results,"" he said.",most stem cell research targeted at the heart uses adult stem cells
"university of delaware students are being offered counseling after a doctoral student allegedly hid video cameras in restrooms around the university's newark campus over a two-year period. police were alerted after a hidden camera was discovered in a women's restroom on june 27, the university said. an investigation led to the arrest of 38-year-old javier mendiola-soto, a doctoral student from mexico. mendiola-soto has been charged with 21 counts of violation of privacy. his visa has been revoked, and he is in custody. police searching mendiola-soto's home found approximately 1,500 computer video files. ""the analysis concluded that the suspect hid video cameras in other restrooms both on and off campus over a more than two-year period from 2012 until his arrest this month,"" the university said in a statement. ""the scope of the recordings continues to be a focus of the investigation, and the police are attempting conclusively to identify all potential recorded locations."" recordings have been traced to two restrooms at the delaware biotechnology institute -- where mendiola-soto worked -- a unisex bathroom in the building housing the education department, and women's restrooms in a library, memorial hall and laboratory, the university said. the investigation has so far identified approximately 40 potential victims. police are contacting victims, and the university is offering counseling to anyone who requests it in connection with the case. ""it is extremely disturbing that this crime was perpetrated against our community invading the privacy of so many women on and around this campus,"" university president patrick harker said. ""we have implemented several actions already, including security sweeps of all restrooms and changing rooms on all campuses, randomly timed examinations of all restrooms by custodial staff and increased police patrols throughout buildings,"" he said. the university's head of campus and public safety, skip homiak, said new technology had increased the risk of such crimes. ""invasions of privacy crimes are becoming an increasing concern on college campuses and in public areas given the ready access to small and sophisticated spying devices,"" he said. the university said the investigation was being conducted ""under strict guidelines and protocols designed to protect the privacy of any individual whose image may have been captured on video."" the video evidence is being securely stored and will be destroyed after criminal proceedings end, it said. police say they don't think the images have been uploaded to the internet or shared. people who think they may have been recorded should contact the university police department hotline at 302-831-4800.",a university of delaware student allegedly hid cameras in restrooms around campus

"-- many californians were startled awake monday night and early tuesday morning by amber alerts that made screeching noises on their cell phones. some people even took to twitter to complain. they better get used to it. the alerts about a blue nissan -- possibly carrying ethan anderson, 8, and sister hannah anderson, 16 -- were the first sent statewide in california under a new program that sends amber alerts about abducted children via text messages to millions of mobile phones. the texts are accompanied by a high-pitched squealing sound to get the phone owner's attention. marc klaas, whose daughter polly was kidnapped from her california home in 1993 and later found dead, was an unlikely critic of monday's statewide alerts, telling cnn that while the messages were well intended, their rollout was ""pretty abysmal."" he feared residents might be put off by the harsh noise and opt out of the program. cell phones have been receiving amber alerts since 2005 under a partnership between the wireless industry, the u.s. justice department and the national center for missing and exploited children. but people had to sign up to receive the alerts -- only about 700,000 did -- and then designate the areas they wanted to get alerts for. they would then only receive alerts for those chosen areas, regardless of where they were physically located. so you could be from nebraska but vacationing in florida, for example, and not get an amber alert about an abduction a dozen miles from your tampa hotel. that system was replaced on december 31, 2012, by the wireless emergency alert program, run by fema, which sends free, automatic notifications to almost every phone in the surrounding area or even the state. cellphone owners now receive amber alerts, as well as emergency weather alerts, based on their proximity to the emergency, not the location of their phone number. and people must opt out if they prefer not to get the alerts. hln: what you should know about mobile amber alerts the messages are sent over a special wireless carrier channel called cell broadcast and aren't affected by congestion that might disrupt regular calls and text messages, according to the national center for missing and exploited children. about 100 amber alerts, sent simultaneously to all compatible mobile devices within range of the cellular towers in the affected area, have been sent nationwide so far under the wireless emergency alert program. the program was credited with locating an abducted 8-month-old boy in minnesota in february. a minneapolis teenager saw an amber alert on his phone and called police about a neighbor whose kia matched the description in the alert. the neighbor was arrested, and the infant was recovered unharmed. carriers representing 98% of all u.s. wireless subscribers are on the new program, and more than 200 models of phones support the alerts, said brian josef, an assistant vice president for regulatory affairs at ctia, the wireless industry trade association. the alerts ""are absolutely saving lives,"" josef said. ""we have stressed that these alerts have been used judiciously, sparingly,"" he added, when asked about irritated reactions to monday's amber alerts in california. once phone users understand what it is, ""they appreciate the information,"" he said. some older phones, including the iphone 4, will not receive the alerts. people can choose not to hear amber alerts by adjusting the notification settings on their phones. monday's alert was the third amber alert in california in 2013 to use the new system, although the first two were only broadcast to phones in specific counties. a massive manhunt was under way tuesday and wednesday in california for james dimaggio, 40, whom law enforcement authorities describe as a friend of the children's mother, christina anderson. launched in texas in 1996, amber alerts were originally sent out via radio, tv and electronic highway signs as part of the national emergency-alert system that includes warnings about extreme weather such as tornadoes and hurricanes. some critics of monday's alert said it was too vague, offering only a description of the wanted vehicle without further context. but californians should appreciate that such a notification system exists in times of crisis, wrote columnist jon healey in the los angeles times. ""the fact that the alerts were broadcast indiscriminately to san diego-area cellphones (and later, to all california phones capable of receiving text messages, as the alert went statewide) clearly annoyed a lot of wireless customers,"" he wrote. ""but the alerts can't really be targeted if police don't know where the kidnapper is, and it's impossible to predict who might be in a position to help. so amber has to cast a wide net to have any hope of succeeding. ""yes, it might have helped if the message had been less cryptic. but now that we've all seen one, we should be able to recognize what such alerts are trying to tell us.""",californians were startled awake this week by amber alerts on their phones

"-- a mother and her young son were at a mall, when she considered buying him a sandwich. she knew her husband would beat her later for spending the $7, but her son was hungry. she swallowed her fear and bought the sandwich. i met a college professor with a phd who told me that her husband took her paycheck every month and that she had to wear long sleeves in the summer to hide the bruises on her arms. when a person tells you these very personal, gut-wrenching stories, you can't help but be moved to act. still, many people hear these stories and they ask, ""why does she stay?"" i've learned that getting away is never easy. there are children to consider. emotional ties are hard to break. oftentimes women simply don't have the money because money is a weapon of choice for many domestic violence perpetrators. the national network to end domestic violence reports that financial abuse almost always accompanies physical abuse and can be the primary obstacle to women breaking free from bondage. it works like this: a man (women are the victims in 85% of cases) sets up a credit card in the woman's name and doesn't pay the bills, ruining the woman's credit. the man forces the woman to put her paycheck into a bank account and won't give her access. he hides all financial documents and won't share passwords for websites. so, the woman often has no money, poor credit, and a limited understanding of her financial situation. even if she is desperate to leave an abusive partner and has the courage to move to a local domestic violence shelter, she has no money for transportation, food or clothing. so, the right question isn't: ""why does she stay?"" the right question is: ""how can we help her get safe and secure?"" evidence shows that arming victims with the right tools and information can help. victims need to protect and reclaim their financial resources, rebuild their credit and gain a complete understanding of their financial picture. according to a long-term study by the center for violence against women and children at rutgers university, abused women who participated in a financial education curriculum developed by the allstate foundation and the national network to end domestic violence were twice as likely to take the financial steps necessary to rebuild their lives. the sheer scope of domestic violence overall in this country almost defies belief. data from the centers for disease control shows that one in four women will be a victim of domestic abuse in their lifetime. the cdc also reports that 2 million women are injured in the u.s. every year and that domestic abuse leads to 8 million lost days of work annually. polling by the allstate foundation has shown that almost three quarters of us know a victim, even though few of us realize it. the u.s. department of justice has stated that approximately 1,300 die annually from domestic violence. the united states conference of mayors argues that it is the no. 1 cause of homelessness for women, and the violence scars millions of children each year who witness it. yet, few want to talk about it because it is a dark and ugly subject. the nfl has given us all an opportunity to have deeper conversations about domestic violence. but it shouldn't take a high-profile incident in the news for us to rise up and take a stand against domestic violence. we must seize the opportunity to bring domestic violence and financial abuse out of the shadows and help women trapped in abusive relationships find the path to safety. business needs to take domestic violence very seriously. we need more businesses to step up and play an active role in protecting women. wherever possible, businesses should take into account extenuating circumstances such as domestic violence when considering credit histories and ratings. companies should make sure employee benefit plans provide a helping hand when needed. managers should be trained on how best to identify and support employees who are victims of abuse at home. in addition, all of us can rise up, including role models in sports and entertainment, academia, educators and concerned citizens. only by pulling back the curtain and getting involved can we ensure that victims can escape to a safer and brighter future. join us on facebook.com/cnnopinion.",thomas wilson: money is a weapon of choice for those engaging in domestic violence

"-- it was late morning on saturday and the day so far had been relatively calm. fears of widespread bloody clashes during thailand's election process had failed to turn into reality. we had decided to go to a suburb of bangkok, an area called lak si, where i had heard a group of pro-election campaigners were marching to the lak si administration office where voting ballots for that constituency were kept. that office had been blocked by anti-election protestors. a few hours later, the pro-election protesters arrived but kept a distance of several hundred meters from their counterparts. all of a sudden, i heard the sound of firecrackers being thrown back and forth though i couldn't work out exactly where the noise was coming from. then -- the sound of a gunshot. i saw pro-election protesters flinch and throw themselves to the ground. things went quiet for a bit. then some pro-election protesters started gathering together, and i ran over to see what was going on. it was a man sitting on the floor. he was shot in the chest, but could still talk. what had been a relatively peaceful protest that day turned violent with no warning and this man the first casualty. more was to come. the pro-election protesters started to yell at an anti-government protest group who had just arrived with a big loudspeaker truck on the other side of lak si intersection in bangkok. one pro-election protester told me the shot was fired from that side. i thought i should withdraw, and decided to catch up with my colleagues, who had just crossed the road. as i crossed the road, a speaker on the truck said ""please keep hidden on the left side of our truck, and walk slowly."" i moved behind a square-shaped cement barrier, and thought maybe i could put my camera on top of the barrier and take a steady shot as the truck passed by. that's when a group of three masked men ran from behind the truck. i thought, ""that's strange, their leader said to walk along the truck."" that's when i realized the men were running toward me, toward my camera. they saw me for sure. the group of men reached my position and there was only a low cement barrier between us. suddenly they started firing handguns in the direction of the pro-election protesters. one man carried a large green bag, which looked to conceal a rifle. i was sitting upright, but i dropped my back to the ground immediately. all i could think was that i had to keep my camera recording. would my lens capture the gunmen? once i felt like i had gotten the footage, my next thought was: ""i should get out of here? after all, the gunfire was still going."" i peeked my head from behind the cement barricade and i asked a nearby man, ""can i leave, please? or should i stay?"" only after i had spoken, did i notice the pistol in his hand. his face looked stern. ""you journalist, don't film this. if i have to destroy your camera, then don't blame me."" so i had to put my camera down. apart from myself, there were at least a half-dozen other cameramen who were stuck and trapped along these gunmen, for 40 minutes or more. eventually i tried again. i asked the same man, ""is it a good time for us to leave?"" he said okay. ""keep yourself lower than the barriers and crawl."" so we left -- i went first. we crawled along the road, keeping next to the cement barriers along the way. i crawled past six pistol-wielding gunmen who were mingling with anti-government protesters. some gunmen wore masks, some didn't. they were firing toward the pro-election protesters the whole time. i could feel bullets zipping not far past my ears. while crawling, i also saw another two gunmen with rifles, unmasked. they, too, were shooting in the direction of the pro-election protesters. in the end, it probably took about 15 minutes to reunite with my colleagues at the other side of the road. but it felt like forever. and though only a small moment in what has been months of protests, it served as a reminder and a warning that the situation is far from resolved in thailand -- that passions remain high and that bloodshed is sadly only a moment of madness away.",cnn reporter kocha olarn saw pro-election protester shot in the chest

life on the strip. what happens here stays here ... and all that good stuff. by the end of our trip, the four of us had seen just about everything you would expect to see in a place nicknamed sin city -- except for faith-based protesters. funny, a week of walking up and down the main artery of the self-proclaimed heart of moral debauchery, and nary a bible verse could be heard. in the many times i've been to las vegas over the years, i've never seen a religious protest. and yet let a midsize city try to add sexual orientation to its municipal nondiscrimination policy or a high school senior bring a same-gender date to prom, and you would think it was the apocalypse. the bible doesn't state that one sin is greater than another, but you wouldn't know that by counting the number of comments that quote scripture on news stories about the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered community. compare them with how many address murder, or the environment, or the wars in iraq and afghanistan, and well, the word ""hypocrite"" comes to mind. i am never ashamed to say i follow the teachings of christ, but i am not always proud to say i am a christian. that's because i am bothered by the continual mutilation of my religion's basic principle of love by the extremists in my religion who construct a hierarchy of sin -- which does not exist in the bible -- for no other reason than to protect their own prejudices. we've seen this throughout this country's history, and perhaps with the exception of abortion, no current issue illustrates this transgression more so than gay rights. some conservatives might attend church only twice a year, but ask their opinion about gays in the military. they can find leviticus 18:22 blindfolded, handcuffed and sinking underwater: ""thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is an abomination."" rarely do you hear them mention the other ""sexual sins"" in leviticus, such as making love to your wife while she's menstruating. there are some people who say jesus freed us from the old laws with one side of their mouths while using old laws to condemn glbt people with the other. many turn to the destruction of sodom as proof against homosexuality. but the king james version lists fornication, greed and lying as sins committed in sodom as well, and never specifies which particular sin caused god's wrath. in fact, the word ""sodomite,"" which some like to toss around as an anti-gay insult, is a mistranslation and is not used in the original hebrew text. the actual word is ""kadesh,"" and it does not refer to the city, its inhabitants or a specific sexual act. it refers to the occult male prostitutes in the shrines, just as ""kedesha"" refers to the female equivalent. neither word reflects sexual orientation. it may be convenient to say sodom was all about homosexual people, but historically and scripturally, that isn't accurate. this is why i, like so many other christians, do not follow a literal interpretation of the bible. i'm not ducking leviticus, i'd just rather go directly to the source. concepts get lost in translation, and we all know history is filled with influential people and institutions that have defined religion for the masses based upon their own selfish needs. for example, king henry viii, the man who authorized the first english translation of the bible, was married six times and essentially had the british empire separate from the roman catholic church so he could divorce in peace. then there's king james, whose own writings suggest he was secretly gay or bisexual, according to historians such as michael b. young and caroline bingham. he was directed to marry for the sake of the throne before authorizing the version of the bible that swapped ""kadesh"" for ""sodomite"" in the first place. hmm, where have we heard that story -- closeted gay politician with an anti-gay policy -- before? but theology and history aside, it is clear from the lack of consistent reaction to and organization against the litany of other present-day sins that a large number of people who call themselves christians do not follow the literal interpretation of the bible either. so, if some of us are picking and choosing which bible verses to follow, why are so many opting to pick and choose verses that appear to condemn homosexuality and not the one against marrying a woman who isn't a virgin? if sin is sin, why such christian angst directed at the glbt community and not the greedy corporate community, which, quite frankly, has more direct impact on the average person's life? the answer is simple: those who are uncomfortable or fearful of someone who is different from them sometimes hide behind religion to gain power, nurture their ignorance and justify their prejudices. it's no different from christian slave owners using scriptures to feel better about enslaving africans, or men pointing to jezebel as a way to keep women out of the clergy, or bob jones university picking verses that supported the school's ban on interracial dating. the extremists aren't fighting gay rights because of sin and honoring leviticus 18:22. if they were, then where are the faith-based organizations spending millions trying to make adultery a crime punishable by death, as suggested in leviticus 20:10? is 18:22 more true than 20:10, or does it just support a more common and entrenched prejudice? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lz granderson.",lz granderson: the bible doesn't state one sin is greater than another; sin is sin.
"-- west virginia's attorney general and state legislators announced tuesday that they'd join those investigating a chemical spill that left hundreds of thousands scrambling for safe water, with one senator promising ""there will definitely be a change."" ""this whole series of events is unacceptable,"" said senate majority leader john unger, who will be leading the state legislative probe, echoing many others around west virginia and elsewhere since the crisis boiled up last thursday. these latest investigations came out the same day that a few thousand more west virginians were told they could use their tap water again, for the first time in nearly a week. still, nearly two-thirds of the nearly 300,000 people initially prohibited from using their taps still are waiting for the all-clear. their headaches and heartaches trace to the leak of several thousand gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- a substance used in the coal industry -- from a storage tank belonging to a company called freedom industries. that chemical made its way into the elk river, to a water plant about a mile upstream, then into the water system. residents of nine counties -- including the one that is home to charleston, west virginia's capital and most populated city -- were urged last week not to use their tap water to do anything except flush their toilets. with its strong odor as the telltale sign, officials warned that they couldn't say that the water so many rely on to drink, cook using or wash themselves with was safe. authorities worked to flush the foul-smelling chemical from the area water system, all while conducting tests that eventually showed it declining. chemical spill shines spotlight on loose regulation but it has been only recently some have been told they can use their water, such as the lifting of the ""do not use"" order tuesday morning for the southridge/southside area near charleston. by tuesday evening, about 114,000 people were advised it was safe for them to run their taps again -- with more than 180,000 remaining in limbo. and it's not just individual citizens in their homes who have been affected. without safe water, schools and many businesses such as hotels, restaurants and more decided to close. gov. earl ray tomblin's office said schools would remain closed in four counties wednesday, leaving about 46,000 students at leisure. amid this widespread pain, a number of local, state and federal authorities have announced they're launching investigations intent on getting to the bottom of what happened and holding people, agencies and companies responsible for the spill and possible issues in the response. investigators from the kanawha county fire department and the state department of environmental protection were among the first at the scene. by the next day, u.s. attorney booth goodwin announced that his office was also looking into what happened, telling cnn that ""even a negligent release of this kind could be a criminal violation."" also on the federal side, environmental protection agency investigators went to the scene as did a team from the u.s. chemical safety board. plus, two u.s. congressmen -- reps. henry a. waxman and paul d. tonko, democrats from california and new york respectively -- said in a letter monday they believe the spill may have exposed regulatory gaps in the country's chemical control laws. two new authorities in the state of west virginia on tuesday announced their own investigations. attorney general patrick morrisey said in a statement that his office plans ""to get to the bottom of this and ensure that the public knows the truth"" -- including what happened, why and how might it have been prevented. ""we need to make sure this never happens again, and that responsible parties are held accountable,"" morrisey said of his office's ""unbiased, independent inquiry."" and unger, the democratic state senator from berkeley, said the joint legislative oversight commission on state water resources -- which he co-chairs -- is also digging into the ""unacceptable"" ordeal. among other things, that legislative body will look into who knew what and when, ""and if no one knew, why not."" ""there will definitely be a change to the way things have been done in the past,"" unger said. and it's not just west virginians who are affected. the greater cincinnati water works, which serves that ohio city and parts of four counties in ohio and kentucky, will temporarily stop taking water from the ohio river as a precaution, allowing water that might contain traces of the chemical to pass the city, company spokeswoman michele ralston said tuesday. two kentucky water systems -- in ashland and russell -- temporarily turned off their valve systems, dick brown, a spokesman for the department for environmental protection, told cnn. the move was strictly a precaution since the elk river is a tributary to the kanawha, which feeds into the ohio river. the cincinnati utility is sampling the ohio river water and so far hasn't detected anything out of the ordinary, ralston said. the move will not disrupt customers' water supplies because the company has a two-day reserve and a groundwater plant that can provide even more treated water, she said. opinion: it's ok, the water's safe to flush cnn's matt smith, michael pearson, jason hanna, alina machado and meridith edwards contributed to this report.","new: more people are told they can use water; more than 180,000 still under ""do not use"" order"
"(cnn) -- low visibility caused by mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the pilot of an afriqiyah airways flight that crashed just before landing in tripoli, libyan sources with knowledge of the investigation said saturday. the plane, an airbus a330-200, originated in johannesburg, south africa, and was at the end of its nearly nine-hour flight when it crashed wednesday. all but one of the 104 passengers on board were killed. the sources said that as the pilot approached tripoli international airport, he took the plane off auto-pilot hoping to manually land the aircraft. he realized he was in trouble and tried to pull the plane up and turn the auto-pilot back on to give it another try, the sources said. but the effort was too late and the plane slammed violently into the ground, explaining the condition of the wreckage and damage to the plane's tail at the crash site, the sources said. an investigation into the crash is under way, and authorities are reviewing the aircraft's flight data recorder. meanwhile ruben van assouw, the 9-year-old sole survivor of the plane crash, has returned home to the netherlands. he suffered multiple fractures to his legs and underwent surgery at al khadra hospital, said a doctor at the hospital who declined to give her name. both of ruben's parents and a brother were killed in the crash, a dutch foreign ministry representative said. ruben's family issued a statement friday expressing gratitude to people who have helped them, such as libyan hospital professionals and dutch envoys, as well as the outpourings of sympathy from citizens in both countries. the family also thanked ""the vast majority of the dutch media for respecting our privacy."" the family, which will raise ruben, said the boy knows that his parents and brother were killed.

""the coming period will be very difficult for us,"" the family said. ""we hope that all the media will respect our privacy."" more than two-thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were dutch, the ministry said. passengers from libya, south africa, belgium, austria, germany, france, zimbabwe and britain were also among the victims, the airline said on its web site. the dutch foreign ministry said friday it is sending more experts to tripoli to help libyan authorities and dutch colleagues identify the victims.",sources: mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the pilot of crashed plane

[video clip begins] alley: and then when i gained weight the last time and lost it, i honest to god thought, this is it. this will be the last time i ever do this again. winfrey: yes. and now you know differently. but you knew because you had all that exercise equipment in your house, remember? we went to your house, and there was all the exercise equipment in the living room. alley: and i moved it out and made it a dining room. [video clip ends] king: that's kirstie sort of making fun of this, don't you think? ireland: i appreciate her honesty and her openness. and oprah, she has let us know that there's no shame in a weight gain. with the picture that our son took of me, i was tempted to push the delete button. but, you know, beautiful people come in all shapes and sizes, ages and colors. but we've got to get the message out about health. what kind of message is that sending to our children? king: kathy, are we getting better? ireland: i hope we're getting better. i pray we're getting better. we've got to teach our children. we've got to get the message out there for women, don't beat yourself up. but please be healthy. don't put off your health. it's too important. king: do you notice more interest? greene: i see more interest in the foods we eat, but i see less interest in moving more, which is at least one-third of the problem, and even less interest in resolving the things in our life that drive us to the refrigerator. king: this is not purely american, is it? or is it? greene: no, it's starting to shift over into australia, new zealand, overseas. so it's not uniquely american.","ex-model kathy ireland: quit worrying about image, start taking care of your heart"
"he was a big boy. a very, very big boy. in fact, the dreadnoughtus schrani dinosaur unveiled thursday was one of the biggest -- if not the biggest -- land animal ever to grace the earth. experts estimate that back in its day -- the upper cretaceous period, approximately 77 million years ago -- this giant measured 85 feet long and weighed about 65 tons. no wonder, then, paleontologists picked a first name that breaks down to ""fear nothing."" (the second name honors benefactor and tech entrepreneur adam schran.) you wouldn't be scared, either, if you towered over every creature in sight, could smash most anything with your whip-like tail and could smoosh most anything with your colossal feet. ""dreadnoughtus schrani was astoundingly huge,"" said kenneth lacovara, the lead author of the report published in scientific reports, as quoted on his school drexel university's website. ""it weighed as much as a dozen african elephants or more than seven t. rex."" the fossilized remains of this dreadnoughtus were unearthed recently in argentina's southwestern patagonia. 8 places for fantastic fossil finds and to think the massive dinosaur pieced together by lacovara's team was still growing up, according to expert analysis. it's hard to say how much bigger this or other dreadnoughtus may have gotten had it fully matured. nor, without a time machine, can one quickly determine whether this new species was bigger than fellow titanosaurs such as the similarly gargantuan argentinosaurus. that's mostly because other finds like these are relatively incomplete, forcing paleontologists to make estimates based off a bone or two here and there. ""titanosaurs are a remarkable group of dinosaurs, with species ranging from the weight of a cow to the weight of a sperm whale or more,"" said matthew lamanna, a carnegie museum of natural history scholar who was part of the team, in the drexel piece. ""but the biggest dinosaurs have remained a mystery because, in almost all cases, their fossils are very incomplete."" not so with the new dreadnoughtus specimen, which is another big reason -- big being the operative word for everything about this creature -- it's so special. those who excavated the sometimes snow-covered terrain not far from antarctica were able to locate more than 70% of the dreadnoughtus' bones, including part of a jaw. compare that to maybe 3% to 27% for other dinosaur finds of its kind. lacovara characterized the discovery as ""by far the best example we have of any of the most giant creatures to ever walk the planet."" as heavy as 14 elephants, as long as 2 tractor trailers: meet mr. titanosaur and it's not like the scientists unearthed little chicken bones. a picture lacovara posted to twitter showed a woman next to one of dreadnoughtus' scapulas, or shoulder blades, both roughly the same size. its humerus, or upper arm, bone was taller than the drexel university professor. a neck vertebra measured about 3 feet in diameter. all these things -- from fossils of large bones to a single tooth, from part of a jaw to toes and a claw -- coupled with digital technology could help to learn a great deal about the dreadnoughtus and other titanosaurs' lived in their era, beyond the fact it had a 37-foot-long neck and 30-foot-long tail. one thing that it would have had to do, to get this big, is eat. a lot.

"-- thursday night's debate was the joe biden show. and like many shows, the beginning was excellent, the middle was painful to watch, and the finish was what we expected. the beginning: i'm calling it the first 45 minutes. the vice president was at his best. yes, he had some smiles, but he had those four years ago. this time it was more obvious because the camera was always on him, and his teeth seemed so white as to make a dentist blush. seriously, put the bleach tray down, joe, or there won't be enough left over for washing the dirty clothes. however, biden followed those smiles (and laughs -- which i don't like and always recommend against) with indignation about what paul ryan was saying. he followed those smiles with arguments that ryan was wrong on his facts, wrong on his history and wrong about president barack obama. had it not been clear that biden was smiling because he thought ryan was saying something ridiculous, it would have bothered me more. but for me, the smiles didn't get in the way too much once i put my ray-bans on. for the first 45 minutes, biden dominated the discussion. the domination began with him telling ryan, ""with all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey."" biden never let up. he hammered away on the topic of iran, arguing that the republicans wouldn't have been successful at getting support for sanctions from either russia or china. opinion: feisty biden, wonky ryan foreign policy is biden's wheelhouse. so when the topic came to israel and ryan continued mitt romney's line that obama doesn't consider prime minister benjamin netanyahu a close ally, biden had one of his best moments. he said ""bibi"" netanyahu has ""been my friend 39 years."" so he both reminded us of his experience in foreign policy and made clear that he considers netanyahu such a friend that he calls him by his nickname. it was an excellent moment for biden. biden's strength in this debate was his approach to the middle class and senior citizens. he never failed to take an opportunity to remind the american public that romney is ""a guy who says 47% of the american people are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives."" biden tied romney's ""47%"" comments (even saying, ""if you heard that little soliloquy on 47% and you think he just made a mistake, then i got a bridge to sell you"") into his best points of the evening. he looked right at the camera and said, ""folks, use your common sense. who do you trust on this?"" and ""folks, follow your instincts"" on issues such as medicare vouchers and social security privatization. at one point he spoke directly to seniors. it was a nice touch. but then inertia took over. i'll call this the next 30 minutes. after running right over ryan, with the republican barely making headway for the first 45 minutes, biden lost control of the car. the over-steering was perhaps due to excessive coaching after the president's lackluster debate. at any rate, once he had run over ryan, it was a quick swerve in the other direction, and then biden thumped the moderator, martha raddatz, with interrupting indignation. then biden accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake pedal. his runaway berating was now headed toward the townsfolk. biden kept pointing his finger menacingly. at first, only ryan was the victim of the loose finger. but then biden became trigger-happy with that finger-as-weapon. raddatz couldn't duck fast enough and became the next target. strafing the audience indiscriminately with his scolding, biden was now pointing and shaking his index finger at anything that moved. opinion: partisans are fired up on both sides this was cringe-worthy. biden was so wound up that he was like that family member you're warned about before the big thanksgiving get-together. ""now, don't get uncle billy riled up, because once he gets going, nobody will enjoy their pumpkin pie."" yep. biden turned into uncle billy. he simply didn't know, or didn't have the capability to turn his frustration and emotions off. he interrupted, pointed and scolded so often that i think he finished one point with the phrase, ""you kids get out of my yard."" yet he calmed down and was saved by a personal question about abortion. yes, biden's emotions were put back in check by talking about a woman's right to choose. you know it's a crazy debate when that happens. and for the rest of the debate, he was back to regular joe. he still made emotional appeals, but they were more in check. he was very good again for the last 15 minutes. by the way, who was that high school debater up on the stage with biden? ryan reminded me of so many debaters i've seen in the past. youthful, with ideas -- but in a critical debate they get lost. i'm not sure ryan demonstrated that he's what we need in these tough times. he lacked passion, and he seemed a bit wet behind the ears. did he do badly? by no means. he never lost his cool and he wasn't rude. but with his youthful appearance, and his taking a back seat to biden, ryan was overshadowed. ryan did nothing to win or lose the debate. he just disappeared. ryan underperformed to biden's over-performance. one way or the other, good and bad, it was joe biden's show. join us at facebook/cnnopinion. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of todd graham.","thursday night's debate was the joe biden show, says debate coach todd graham"
"-- north korea's newly launched satellite marks a ""big deal"" for pyongyang, the crossing of a major threshold and a public relations win for the secretive country's new leader, kim jong un, experts say. the success, after years of failed attempts, triggered worries among world leaders about nuclear weapons, iran and the balance of power in the pacific. u.s. defense secretary leon panetta called the launch ""clear provocation."" experts do not believe north korea has a nuclear warhead small enough to fly on the kind of missile that pyongyang has now proved it can send long-distance. and the united states believes the north koreans may not have full control of the satellite they launched into space wednesday, according to one u.s. official who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information. but the launch allowed the regime to flex its military and technological muscle on the world stage. panetta told cnn he is ""very confident"" that if north korea were to launch a missile at the united states, the u.s. military could guard against it. north korea silences doubters, raises fears with rocket launch ""obviously the hope is that we never have to face that kind of threat,"" panetta said. a central reason the united states is working to ""rebalance the pacific"" is to deal with ""the threat from north korea,"" he added. there is ""a path for north korea to end its isolation, but that requires abiding by its international obligations,"" white house spokesman jay carney said wednesday. ""... it has chosen not to, and therefore, there will be consequences for that."" washington is leading the global response, threatening to impose sanctions on pyongyang like those that have helped devastate iran's economy. those efforts were under way wednesday in security council meetings at u.n. headquarters in new york ""members of the security council condemned this launch,"" the council said in a statement, calling it ""a clear violation"" of previous resolutions -- including one in april that demanded north korea halt any launches using ballistic missile technology. success raises stakes for u.s. missile defense system the council considers the issue urgent, the statement said. susan rice, u.s. ambassador to the united nations, called the statement one of the swiftest and strongest she had seen the council make about north korea. ""now we go into the second phase"" of discussions, she said: negotiations about what to do. china and russia, north korean allies and two of the council's permanent members, could exercise their veto power. the united states and other nations may impose unilateral measures, senior administration officials warned. but pyongyang has ignored such threats before. new u.n. sanctions are unlikely, but the council might step up pressure on north korea in other ways, said george lopez, a professor with the university of notre dame's kroc institute for international peace studies, who last year served on a u.n. panel of experts monitoring sanctions already in place against north korea. the council's sanctions committee could add more north korean entities to the sanctions list, he said. it could also do more to enforce sanctions already in place, for example by increasing inspections of cargo leaving north korea to ensure no weapons technology is being shipped out. north korea may not have 'full control' of satellite, u.s. official says what the launch means wednesday's success was a breakthrough for the reclusive, nuclear-equipped state. north korea ""could sell this technology to others, including iran and pakistan, who have been regular customers of north korea's other missiles,"" warns victor cha, who analyzes the region for the center for strategic and international studies. ""they still have other technological thresholds to cross (miniaturized warheads, reentry vehicle), but this was undeniably a major one."" the rocket blasted off from a space center on the country's west coast and delivered a satellite into its intended orbit, the north korean regime said. the launch followed a botched attempt in april and came just days after pyongyang suggested that a planned launch could be delayed. china reaction key as neighbors decry north korea rocket launch north korea's previous claims of successful launches have been dismissed by the united states and other countries. but this time, a u.s. official confirmed that the object is in orbit. u.s. officials were looking into whether it is an operating satellite, the official said. the regime's state-run korean central news agency said the satellite, named kwangmyongsong-3, was ""fitted with survey and communications devices essential for the observation of the earth."" the satellite itself is probably not very sophisticated, said david wright, a senior scientist with the union of concerned scientists. the regime showed it in april, and it was a small box with solar panels and a simple camera with some basic communication devices, he said. opinion: name and shame china over north korea launch he compared it to sputnik 1, the first man-made satellite that russia launched into space in 1957. the value lies in the launch rather than in the object that north korea now has floating above the earth, wright said. the regime doesn't ""really care so much what's in it."" it's a statement, wright said. in japan and south korea, people will hear about north korea's achievement -- and will probably be struck by its power, he said. any show of might can help strengthen north korea's position in international talks on numerous issues, including nuclear negotiations. the south korean government said the launch was confrontational and a ""threat to the peace and stability of the korean peninsula and the world."" japan called it ""intolerable."" the cost of launching a rocket iran praises the launch as much of the world assails it iran, meanwhile, praised north korea's move. gen. masoud jazaeri, a senior iranian military official, expressed happiness about the launch, the semiofficial fars news agency reported. ""experience has shown that independent countries, by self-confidence and perseverance, can quickly reach the height of self-sufficiency in science and technology. hegemonic powers, such as the united states, are unable to stop the progress of such countries,"" he said. china expressed regret that the launch had taken place, noting ""concerns among the international community."" ""we hope relevant parties stay calm in order to maintain peace and stability on the korean peninsula,"" said hong lei, a chinese foreign ministry spokesman. several governments criticized pyongyang's decision to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on its rocket program rather than on assisting its poor, malnourished population. british foreign secretary william hague said he deplored the fact that north korea ""has chosen to prioritize this launch over improving the livelihood of its people."" the north's failed launch in april ended a deal for the united states to provide thousands of tons of food aid to the country. in his father's footsteps ""i think this is very important to kim jong un to build political legitimacy and bolster the spirits of his people,"" said james schoff, a north korea specialist with the carnegie endowment for international peace. ""he is doing this despite the fact that he knows he is going to come into a lot of criticism in the region for it."" the launch has taken place during a period of power consolidation for kim in which he has purged senior military officers in an apparent effort to stamp his authority on the regime's leadership. ""if kim jong un pulls off a successful long-range missile test, it's a very important signal saying that 'yes, i, kim jong un, have replaced the powerful generals,' "" said john park, a stanton junior faculty fellow at the massachusetts institute of technology. ""it shows that 'i have found the right balance and i am now in charge.' "" opinion: one small step for kim jong un the launch also ties in with important dates for the regime's ruling dynasty. pyongyang had said this rocket launch would be ""true to the behests"" of kim jong il, the late north korean leader and father of kim jong un. kim jong il died on december 17 last year, so the rocket launch took place just days before tearful mourners are expected to gather for the first anniversary of his death. experts had also speculated that north korea wanted this launch to happen before the end of 2012, the year that marks the centenary of the birth of kim il sung, the founder of north korea and grandfather of kim jong un. another factor may also be at play: the launch took place ahead of national elections in japan on sunday and in south korea on december 19. north korea is a crucial foreign policy issue in both of those countries. the rocket took off wednesday morning and flew south over japan's okinawa islands. there were conflicting reports about how many parts fell into the sea. read more: what does north korea's planned rocket launch mean? a launch had seemed unlikely to take place so soon after north korea announced monday that it was extending the rocket's launch window into late december, citing technical issues with an engine. previous attempts by the north in 1998, 2006, 2009 and april of this year failed to achieve their stated goal of putting a satellite into orbit and provoked international condemnation. the rockets launched in 1998 and 2009 flew for hundreds of kilometers but didn't succeed in deploying satellites, other countries and experts said at the time. north korea nonetheless insisted that both satellites did reach orbit, with kcna reporting that they were transmitting ""immortal revolutionary"" songs back to earth. the 2006 launch failed soon after takeoff and wasn't reported by state media. in april, the north korean regime invited members of the international news media, including cnn, into the country to observe the preparations for its planned launch. but the strategy backfired when the rocket broke apart shortly after blasting off. on that occasion, state media took the unusual step of admitting the launch's failure. timeline: north korea's rocket-fueled obsession cnn's elise labott, jethro mullen, k.j. kwon, paula hancocks, paul armstrong, erin burnett, junko ogura, barbara starr, jamie crawford, chris lawrence and jessica yellin, and journalist connie young in beijing, contributed to this report.","white house warns ""there will be consequences"""
"-- who knew that 70 years after african-american pilots had to work hard to overcome the prejudices of whites in the u.s. armed services, and the nation having its first black commander-in-chief, the men known as the tuskegee airmen would still be doing battle with an entrenched institution of white power brokers, all based on the color of their skin. many of you may have seen the flashy commercials advertising ""red tails,"" the major motion picture that chronicles the amazing and true story of true american heroes: black pilots who went overseas in world war ii to fight for the freedom and democracy that they could not enjoy at home. the film opens january 20 in theaters nationwide, and for its producer, george lucas, it has been a 23-year odyssey. you would think that someone considered one of the most powerful players in hollywood, a man who has made billions with blockbusters such as the ""indiana jones"" and ""star wars"" franchises, would have been able to get ""red tails"" approved without any hesitation. yet many african-americans have long known that in tinseltown, the color of your skin -- or that of the people in the story you want to tell -- often falls victim to racial pigeonholing. oh, sure, hollywood is seen as a liberal bastion where folks talk about equality and supporting civil rights, but when it comes to telling stories that have mostly black casts, hollywood might as well return to the '50s and '60s and erect signs that say ""whites only."" when lucas approached the major hollywood studios about backing ""red tails,"" he was told: thanks, but no thanks. ""there's no major white roles in it at all ... i showed it to all of them and they said no, we don't know how to market a movie like this,"" lucas told jon stewart on the daily show. let's juxtapose that against some other facts: -- in 2008, 69 million people voted for barack hussein obama as president of the united states; -- the most talked-about woman in america over the past 25 years was oprah winfrey, who redefined the talk show genre; -- which athlete has the top-selling jersey in the nba? lebron james; -- who is considered the top-grossing actor? samuel l. jackson; -- arguably the greatest entertainer of all time is michael jackson; -- the greatest golfer in the world? tiger woods; -- the most dominating players in women's tennis? venus and serena williams; -- the top singer today? beyonce; -- and hip-hop, an outgrowth of black culture, is a worldwide phenemonon. and 80% of the consumers of hip-hop music in america are white kids. so whites all across america have come to accept african-americans in a variety of public media, but hollywood continues to want to tell us that somehow seeing blacks on the big screen is anathema to their values. maybe what no one in hollywood wants to own up to is that in many ways, it is a close-minded society where it's hard to find african-americans in positions of true power. in the history of hollywood, no african-american has ever headed a major studio. yes, we've seen black ceos at american express, time warner, xerox, merrill lynch, symantec and other major companies, but the doors of opportunity are closed in hollywood. does this mean african-americans aren't hired? no. but those are low-level positions where they desperately fight the good fight, knowing full well they will never ascend to the top of the food chain in hollywood. part of hollywood's problem is that when looking at a movie that has, like ""red tails,"" a mostly black cast, it is cast as a ""black"" film. ""red tails"" isn't a black movie. it's a war movie. it's an action movie. it's a story of true american heroes overcoming great odds to succeed. that was the conclusion of alabama head football coach, nick saban, who showed the film to his team the night before they demolished lsu for the bcs national title. did saban conclude it was a black film? not at all, and he gave it a resounding endorsement. this racial fight may be new to george lucas, but to african-americans, this has been a long and painful battle. a few months ago on my tv one cable network sunday show, washington watch, i talked with actor brian white, who has starred in ""stomp the yard,"" ""fighting"" and the critically-acclaimed tv show, ""men of a certain age."" he told a stunning story that shows the ignorance of hollywood regarding an independent movie he starred in with zoe saldana, ""the heart specialist."" ""dennis cooper, the writer, director and producer, is a caucasian man who had some friends,"" white said. ""his friend david was the inspiration for dr. z and dr. howard -- a harvard-educated doctor that was involved with the film. and dennis sold this great script to the studios, but he left the character descriptions out. ""when the studios found out the leads were black, they didn't want to make the movie anymore, and dennis had to go take his own money and his friends' money and make this movie himself and then start the long road to getting a distribution deal."" this isn't just the big studios. the weinstein co. produced ""the hurricane season,"" a basketball film about two teams coming together in the wake of hurricane katrina to win the louisiana state championship. yet the movie went straight to dvd, angering lead actor forest whitaker, and others in the film, including taraji henson, courtney b. vance, isaiah washington and the rapper bow wow. the excuse given the actors? the weinstein co. said they didn't know how to market the film. really. a movie with basketball at the center of the story? folks, come on! hollywood defenders will be quick to say, what about will smith? denzel washington? halle berry? what's interesting in hollywood is that if you're will smith, denzel washington or a handful of others, you really aren't seen as ""black."" for them, they have crossed the post-racial threshold, and in hollywood's eyes, white america will watch them. but if you talk to them and so many other top hollywood actors, they will also tell you stories of having doors slammed in their faces, and trying to get movies made featuring mostly blacks and were told, ""can't you make the characters white?"" what is also at play is that for hollywood, having one black guy in a film that has mostly whites is never called a white film. but if it's one or two white guys in a film with mostly blacks -- uh oh, black film! the latest excuse offered up by the hollywood studios is that ""black films"" don't sell well overseas. what that means is that foreigners also don't want to see african-americans. again, i believe the problem is how the movies are categorized. let's take two black men dressing up as women. when martin lawrence does it in ""big momma's house,"" that isn't marketed as a ""black film."" as a result, it grossed $117.5 million in the united states and $56.4 million worldwide. yet tyler perry's ""madea goes to jail,"" another movie featuring a black guy dressed as a grandmother, did $90 million in the u.s., and they didn't even bother to show it overseas. maybe that's because tyler perry's ""madea's family vacation"" only did $50,000 in ticket sales worldwide three years earlier, and $63.2 million in the u.s. now, if hollywood knows how to sell white men dressed as women (robin williams in ""mrs. doubtfire"" and dustin hoffman in ""tootsie"") along with largely white casts, they can't figure out how to do the same for a tyler perry? george lucas has clearly expressed his fears with ""red tails,"" hoping it opens huge so it will send a message to hollywood that a big-budget action film with lots of black folks can be successful. the downside? if it fails, it will be seen as a failure of all black action films. several hollywood executives told me that when the queen latifah-common helmed film, ""just wright,"" didn't meet expectations and only grossed $21.5 million -- it was marketed as a black film -- the result was a virtual shutdown of all romantic comedies featuring african-americans. yet jennifer aniston can put out failed romantic comedy after failed romantic comedy, and no one says ""white"" romantic comedies should end. have we returned to the days of jackie robinson when he couldn't fail because if he did, the whole race would be set back? that's essentially what hollywood is saying. i want you to go and see ""red tails"" not because it is an historical depiction of a true period in america, but because it's one helluva film. the action scenes are first rate and the storytelling is superb. are the main characters black? yep. just do as i do when i go and see a movie that features an all-white cast, which is most of the time: go for the enjoyment. if so, maybe the libs in hollywood will finally realize that great stories, when sold as such, and not as a ""black"" film, can bring people of all stripes to the movie theater. there used to be a time when whites could sit downstairs, and if blacks were allowed in the movie theater, had to sit upstairs. today, it's clear that such a racial divide is no longer in place in the seats, but now on the screen, and that's a damn shame.","george lucas has been on a 23-year odyssey to get ""red tails"" into theaters"
"-- less than a week after new york became the nation's sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage, rhode island state lawmakers on wednesday voted in favor of a bill that permits civil unions between gay and lesbian couples. the measure, which passed the state senate by a count of 21-16, is widely seen as a compromise intended to provide same-sex couples with added rights and benefits, while also preventing an expanded legal definition of marriage. gov. lincoln chafee, an independent, is expected to sign the bill into law, according to his spokesman, michael trainor. if signed, the law would take effect on july 1, making rhode island the fifth state in the union to allow civil unions between same-sex couples. such unions are currently permitted in new jersey and illinois, and will be allowed in delaware and hawaii beginning january 1, 2012. three west coast states -- california, oregon and washington -- plus nevada, also allow for ""comprehensive domestic partnerships,"" largely considered an equivalent to their civil union counterparts. despite robust opposition to the measure, rhode island's senate judiciary committee approved the bill by a vote of 7-4, sending it to the democrat-controlled senate floor where lawmakers voted in its favor, according to senate spokesman, greg pare. the legislation, which passed overwhelmingly in the state's lower house on may 19, affords same-sex couples a host of new state tax breaks, health-care benefits and greater ease of inheritance. but it also drew sharp criticism from religious leaders and opposition groups who say it will lead to court-ordered action that would eventually legalize same-sex marriage. similar legal action in connecticut and massachusetts resulted in those states adopting same-sex marriage laws, noted christopher plante, executive director of the national organization for marriage's rhode island chapter. chafee -- who is supportive of potential legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage -- says civil unions are ""a step in the right direction,"" according to trainor. meanwhile, gay rights activists -- like marriage equality rhode island -- say that while they support the civil union bill, they would prefer legislation that permits same-sex couples to wed. the group urged chafee not to sign the measure if it includes a house amendment that permits groups with religious affiliations to refuse certain legal rights provided to civil unions. for instance, a hospital with a religious affiliation could refuse a civil union partner from being involved in the emergency medical care decisions of their spouse if it chose to do so, said ray sullivan, a spokesman for the activist group. chafee is ""very aware of the concerns that have been expressed,"" trainor said, but will likely sign the bill into law, which passed the senate with the controversial amendment included. house spokesman larry berman called the issue a ""red herring,"" pursued by the state's more radical activists. the exemption, he said, is meant to provide religious protections against potential litigation. ""it's a small exception,"" berman said, when compared to the slew of new rights and benefits same-sex couples would enjoy should the measure be signed into law. currently, rhode island and maine are the only states in new england that do not permit same-sex marriage. last week, new york gov. andrew cuomo a signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage, more than doubling the number of americans living in states that permit such unions. the measure will take effect on july 24, providing gay and lesbian couples with new rights that include employer health benefits, easier inheritance and a host of state tax breaks. federal recognition, however, was not a part of friday's vote, leaving benefits like social security and ease of immigration largely out of reach for same-sex couples. the controversial bill passed new york's republican-controlled senate before reaching cuomo's desk, in an extended legislative session that left many skeptical over whether lawmakers would bring the measure to a vote. iowa and the district of columbia also allow gay and lesbian couples to wed.",new: senate passes bill that permits civil unions between gay and lesbian couples

"-- two men are being sought for questioning in the brazen daylight robbery of a jewelry store last week, in which some $65 million in merchandise was stolen, authorities said tuesday. security camera footage shows images of the men wanted by police. detectives released surveillance camera photos of the two, in addition to images of some of the rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches taken from graff jewellers on central london's new bond street. a total of 43 items were taken, with a value of about £40 million, or about $65 million, scotland yard said. the heist occurred thursday, when two men walked into the jewelry store at about 4:40 p.m. and threatened employees with handguns. as the robbers were leaving the store, they brought a female worker outside with them before leaving in a blue bmw, scotland yard said. a shot was fired outside the store, but no one was injured. the men abandoned the bmw nearby, firing a second shot into the ground, scotland yard said. police believe they switched to a silver mercedes, then later to a black vehicle, possibly a ford or volkswagen. ""this was a well-planned robbery with a number of vehicles used to help the robbers escape,"" detective chief inspector pam mace said in the statement. ""these men are extremely dangerous and fired at least two shots in busy london streets as they made their getaway. watch how robbers rip off london jewelers » ""someone knows who these men are,"" she said. ""they would undoubtedly have spoken about (the robbery) before or boasted about it afterwards. i would urge anyone who recognizes them, knows the whereabouts of the jewelry or has any other information to contact us."" the images show the two men dressed in suits and ties. one man is white, about 30, police said. the second is a black man believed to be in his 30s with short hair. both men are thought to have spoken with london accents, scotland yard said. the robbery is the latest in a spate of daytime thefts at jewelry stores and designer shops in london's exclusive shopping areas of bond street, which includes new bond street. groups of men or teenagers typically stage ""smash and grab"" robberies, in which they break the windows and steal anything they can get their hands on before speeding away in waiting cars or motorbikes. a cnn camera crew filming in march on oxford street, near bond street, caught a group of thieves speeding away on motorbikes from a jewelry store they had just robbed. the thieves choose to strike during the day when a store's security system is typically disarmed, even though the store and sidewalk may be crowded with people.",two men sought over brazen daylight robbery of a jewelry store in london

""but this cannot be another excuse for delay or obstruction. and russia has to support the international community's efforts sincerely or be held to account,"" she said. a potential democratic contender for president in 2016 who left the state department in january, clinton received questions and some criticism for not speaking out immediately after chemical weapons were allegedly used by the regime of president bashar al-assad last month. cnn poll: most americans against u.s. strike on syria an aide said last week that she supported obama's decision to seek congressional authorization to punish syria militarily, but she had not publicly weighed in until her appearance at the white house on monday. her comments came during an address on wildlife trafficking and followed a meeting with obama. she adhered to the white house line on russia's proposal earlier in the day that syria relinquish chemical weapons to international control to avert a possible u.s. military strike, which obama is trying to get congress to approve. syria welcomed the proposal, paving the way for a possible diplomatic solution to the crisis that comes amid a two-year civil war in syria that has killed more than 100,000 people, according to u.n. estimates. clinton's successor, secretary of state john kerry, discussed a similar scenario, though the state department stressed that al-assad could not be trusted to give up his country's chemical stockpiles. and just moments before clinton's remarks, white house spokesman jay carney said the ""credible threat"" of a u.s. military attack on syria led to the russian proposal. but he said any such plan would require close evaluation and that washington remained ""highly skeptical"" of the syrian regime. clinton said syria's alleged use of chemical weapons ""violates a universal norm at the heart of our global order"" and ""demands a strong response"" from the world led by the united states. house of assad' survives on loyalty, brutality ""this world will have to deal with this threat as swiftly and comprehensively as possible,"" she said. clinton did not say whether military action, as proposed by obama, would be the best course. but she emphasized she will support the president and argued a ""political solution that ends the conflict is in the interested of the united states."" she reiterated the white house's notion that russia's proposal could have only taken place ""in the context of a credible military threat by the united states to keep pressure on the syrian government."" behind the scenes, clinton worked the phones for obama, who is trying to convince congress to go along with his plan for a limited, targeted military response. clinton, a former senator, called arkansas sen. mark pryor over the weekend, a source familiar with the call confirmed to cnn. but pryor had already made up his mind to vote against military action and announced his decision on saturday. the source would not speak on the record because the phone call was private. a separate source familiar with the call confirmed clinton also called sen. charles schumer, d-new york, over the weekend. he already supported military authorization when the call took place. clinton will likely repeat her white house comments during a speech tuesday night at the national constitution center in philadelphia, a clinton source told cnn. in addition to pushing for diplomatic efforts to remove al-assad from power, clinton backed a proposal last year to provide weapons to syrian rebels when she served as secretary of state. clinton also issued warnings in january shortly before leaving office about iran's involvement in syria, saying the country was providing al-assad's regime with military supplies. she urged iran, as well as russia, to reconsider their aid to the war-torn country. as obama's top diplomat during his first term, clinton was automatically associated with the administration's response to the syrian civil war until she stepped down early this year. and she's faced some criticism for that response as debates over syria heat up in washington.

""but we have a very different situation today. after nearly two years, 100,000 people killed, a rebel force comprised of al qaeda and a syrian regime in a much stronger position, a military strike would no longer be in our national security interest,"" the former pennsylvania lawmaker said. santorum is considered a potential candidate for the republican presidential nomination in 2016. before leaving the state department, clinton defended her role in the situation.

""we can thank crude oil for allowing gasoline to do what it has been wanting to do for weeks, which is drop,"" said publisher trilby lundberg. gasoline supplies are plentiful, but crude oil prices had been ""propping up"" gasoline costs, she said. as crude oil prices have stabilized, gasoline prices have fallen. ""we may see another five to 10 cents decline in the next few weeks"" if crude oil doesn't rise, she said. even looking ahead to later in may, as the country enters peak driving season, prices might not jump if crude oil stays stable because gasoline supplies are flush, lundberg said. the average price nationally one year ago was $3.88 -- just three cents under the current average, lundberg said. the lundberg survey tabulates prices every two weeks at thousands of gas stations nationwide. over the past two weeks, the average price in chicago has fallen nearly 19 cents, to $4.26 -- but that's still the highest of any city in the latest survey, taken friday. the city with the lowest average gas price was tulsa, oklahoma, at $3.52. here are prices in some other cities: atlanta: $3.79 boston: $3.95 denver: $3.87 houston: $3.85 memphis, tennessee: $3.72 portland, oregon: $4.02 san francisco: $4.21",the average u.s. gasoline price is $3.91 per gallon

"news reports indicate that north korea may be preparing for a nuclear test, potentially scheduled to coincide with president obama's visit to south korea this week. the north korean foreign minister warned tuesday that obama's trip could ""escalate confrontation and bring the dark clouds of a nuclear arms race,"" prompting speculation that the impulsive young leader of the north, kim jong un, is again crying out for attention. typically, experts and government officials refer to these outbursts and nuclear or missile tests as ""provocations,"" which are followed by sanctions, tensions and -- it is hoped -- a return to diplomacy. but by now, it should be obvious that while north korean behavior appears cyclical (""there they go again""), pyongyang is on a clear, linear path to developing nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them on target in japan and eventually the united states. north korea's third and most recent nuclear test, in february 2013, used a relatively small 6- to 9-kiloton plutonium-based nuclear warhead, according to the south korea ministry of defense, roughly half the yield of the nuclear bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki. if north korea's new test is substantially larger, it will demonstrate that pyongyang either has mastered the warhead design challenges of plutonium-based weapons or has covertly enriched uranium. if it is the former case, north korea will more easily be able to miniaturize its nuclear warhead technology for mating with ballistic missiles. if the latter case, north korea will probably demonstrate the ability to covertly stockpile large amounts of fissile material, since highly enriched uranium facilities can be more easily hidden underground and north korea has plenty of uranium mines to obtain the necessary fuel. either way, a ""new form"" of north korean nuclear test would signal a substantial increase in the country's nuclear capabilities and not just another provocation requiring a short-term punishment from the international community. the united states and its allies and partners would no doubt seek to place additional sanctions on north korea through the united nations, if such a test were to occur. however, given current tensions with russia, as well as chinese concern about north korean stability, it is unlikely that the u.n. security council would approve substantial new sanctions. yet, deterring north korea is critical. what more could be done? first, if the united states cannot win substantial new sanctions at the u.n., it should take additional steps in concert with south korea, japan and other allies and partners to squeeze the north's ability to import or export dangerous materials related to their missile and nuclear programs. additional sanctions should target north korean use of international banks to conduct illicit activities. although some of these institutions have been targeted (most notably banco delta asia in 2005), more can be done to cut north korea off from its international financing. a coalition of like-minded states could also agree to inspect any and all ships or planes that have departed from north korea in the previous six months. this same coalition would work together to pressure beijing to increase inspections and cut off illicit banking activities with north korea. moving china to action has usually been a challenge, but additional north korean provocations and kim jong un's execution of his uncle and china's contact in pyongyang, jang song thaek, could motivate china to take steps, particularly once it is clear that the u.s. is no longer willing to rely on the security council for another round of weak sanctions. second, the u.s. should respond to any north korean test by increasing cooperation trilaterally with japan and south korea. although south korea-japan relations have been at a low point, the united states has spearheaded efforts to make progress in the bilateral relationship in recent months. obama's visit to both countries will surely touch on this issue, but a north korean provocation could help him drive japan and south korea toward closer cooperation, particularly on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; missile defense; and logistics. this would not only improve u.s.-japan-south korea cooperation but could also deter additional provocative actions and put pressure on chinese leaders to restrain their north korean ally. in december 2010, the u.s., japan and south korea came very close to issuing a joint collective security statement, declaring that an attack by the north on any of us would be an attack on all of us, after the north sank a south korean vessel and shelled civilians on a south korean-held island. that high bar could become achievable again. third, the united states should bolster its extended deterrent framework -- or nuclear umbrella -- in east asia. today, some question u.s. willpower in the face of threats in the asia pacific region, particularly after the uncertain u.s. responses to aggression in syria and ukraine. a north korean nuclear test would require the u.s. to make unambiguous statements about the defense of our allies and follow through with demonstrations of american capability, including deployments of assets like the b-2 bomber to guam and increased exercises with japan and korea. north korea is estimated to have enough fissile material now for between six and 12 nuclear weapons and is working hard on miniaturization and longer-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting not only japan but someday, potentially, the united states. at this rate, it will not be long before an american president is going to ask his staff who let north korea develop the ability to threaten the united states with impunity and why more wasn't done to stop the north. we know that diplomacy has failed to knock the north off its goal and that a military strike would risk dangerous retaliation against japan and korea. but in between war and diplomacy, we have a range of options that could constrict the north's program and buy us time until the threat can be removed peacefully through diplomacy or collapse of the onerous regime in pyongyang.",north korea may launch nuclear test to coincide with obama's visit to south korea
"-- south african prosecutors will appeal the verdict and the sentence in the oscar pistorius case, a spokesman for the country's national prosecuting authority told cnn on monday. a judge sentenced pistorius to five years in prison last week after finding the double-amputee track star guilty of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, in the shooting death of his girlfriend, reeva steenkamp. pistorius acknowledged shooting steenkamp in february 2013. prosecutors claim he wanted to kill her; pistorius said he mistook her for an intruder and her killing was a tragic accident. the appeal doesn't necessarily mean either the verdict or the sentence against pistorius will be thrown out, said cnn legal analyst kelly phelps. and it's even less likely he will be freed at the end of what's likely to be a six-month process, she said. ""there's no real prospect of his acquittal out of this,"" she said. prosecutors are arguing that judge thokozile masipa misinterpreted a complex south african standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case, phelps said. as a result, prosecutors argue, he should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge. prosecutors originally took pistorius to trial on a murder charge. in explaining her sentence, masipa concluded that pistorius did not intend to kill steenkamp. but critics of the verdict have argued the judge didn't correctly apply the intent standard, which is broader in south african law than what it typically means in casual conversation, phelps said. in their appeal of the sentence, prosecutors would have to prove the five years given by masipa is ""shockingly inappropriate"" in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases, according to phelps. prosecutor gerrie nel called for a minimum sentence of 10 years, saying the negligence in pistorius' actions ""borders on intent."" if an appeals court finds that five years is ""shockingly inappropriate,"" the court could set the sentence aside and issue a new one, she said. but appeals courts in south africa are reluctant to get involved in sentencing decisions, phelps said. pistorius' uncle, arnold pistorius, told cnn's robyn curnow, ""we take note of the announcement made by the state. the legal process must take its course."" cnn's eliott c. mclaughlin and brent swails contributed to this report.",south african prosecutors to appeal verdict and sentence in the oscar pistorius case
"(cnn)on sunday, at almost the same moment that dozens of world leaders linked arms and led millions of people through the streets of paris to commemorate the 17 victims of last week's terror attacks in france, explosives carried by two young girls ripped through a mobile phone market in the northeastern nigerian town of potiskum. the blasts, which killed three people besides the bombers and injured 46 more, came just a day after another bomb, strapped to a girl described by witnesses as about 10 years old, exploded in a busy market in the city of maiduguri, killing at least 20 people. while coming in widely divergent settings, thousands of miles apart, the attacks in france and nigeria were both motivated by an islamist extremist ideology that rejects a modern world shaped by political, economic, and social liberalism -- and in the case of boko haram, whose name can be roughly translated as ""(western) education is forbidden,"" also abhors scientific progress. to achieve this end, no deed is too brutal or tactic too low, as is underscored both by the recent actions of boko haram and the posthumously posted video by the gunman who killed four hostages in a kosher grocery store near paris. the difference has been that while there has been an outpouring of solidarity for the french victims and pledges of international solidarity for france's stand against violent extremism, nothing similar has been forthcoming for nigeria's fight against the growing power of boko haram, at least not since the ephemeral and largely ineffectual global social media phenomenon of the #bringbackourgirls campaign last year. this is despite the fact that over the course of recent months, boko haram has proven itself to be as much of a threat to international peace and security as the so-called islamic state of iraq and syria, which has received so much attention. in fact, as jamestown foundation terrorism analyst jacob zenn has pointed out, boko haram's videos show a troubling convergence between the nigerian militants and their isis counterparts not only in terms of symbolism and ideology, but also insurgency doctrine. boko haram leader abubakar shekau, for example, first expressed ""support"" for the isis caliph, abu bakr al-baghdadi, this past summer. meanwhile, boko haram has added the jihadist black banner to its logo and the isis anthem to the musical repertoire on its videos. in one recent video, shekau even seemed to declare that he is establishing his own ""islamic caliphate"" and greeted his ""brothers"" in afghanistan, pakistan, somalia, and yemen, as well as ""the caliphate in iraq and syria."" even more worrisome than boko haram's extremist ideology and gruesome terrorist acts should be the increasing military sophistication demonstrated by the nigerian militants. alas, while it is largely ignored by american and european leaders and only sporadically covered by major media outlets, boko haram has been steadily gaining ground in its war against nigeria. as i wrote several months ago, boko haram has, like isis, clearly moved beyond one-off asymmetric attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in the assimilation of increasingly large chunks of territory, successfully overrunning and now effectively controlling large portions of three states in northeastern nigeria -- by some estimates, a total area larger than the netherlands, belgium, and luxembourg combined. boko haram's territorial base has been used by the group as a staging ground for what has become a steady campaign of terrorist attacks, like the past weekend's suicide bombings, which regularly hit more than half a dozen other nigerian states as well as neighboring countries like niger, many of which are already under significant pressure from militants linked to al qaeda's north african affiliate. niger's president mahamadou issoufou has even gone so far as to declare to the newsmagazine jeune afrique that ""the islamic state is at our door."" by some estimates, more than 10,000 people in nigeria alone have died as a result of boko haram-related violence in 2014, while more than 1.5 million others have been displaced. just last week, the militants stormed baga on the shores of lake chad, one of the last towns in the region remaining in government hands, reportedly killing more than 2,000 civilians. moreover, the militants are showing increasingly advanced conventional military capabilities, in contrast with the demoralized nigerian military forces they square off against. in early september, for example, the group shot down a nigerian attack jet that was operating against it and captured the pilot, whom it later apparently beheaded, according to a video obtained by the associated press. what makes the threat from boko haram all the more significant is the political and economic context of nigeria, africa's most populous country and the largest economy on the continent. the west african country is in the midst of a hotly contested general election, including a rematch presidential race between incumbent president goodluck jonathan and former military ruler muhammadu buhari, with votes to be cast just a month from now. no doubt boko haram, which rejects democratic politics along with other ""infidel"" ideas, will take advantage of the campaign and voting process to step up attacks. it is hard to imagine how the threat could not have an impact on the vote. in paris on sunday, police and military forces fanned out across the french capital, meaning there was a reasonable sense of safety for marchers. in nigeria, even if the country deployed every last soldier and policeman, it would barely be able to put one security officer at each of its polling stations. and, as if this were not bad enough, declining oil prices have slashed nigerian government revenues, substantially diminishing the resources available to defeat the extremists in battle and win the subsequent peace with social and economic development of an area whose long-running marginalization helped give rise to the insurgency in the first place. it does, of course, go without saying that both the nigerian political class and its military, with all their attendant pathologies, bear responsibility for the dire situation the country finds itself in. but that fact alone should not absolve the international community of its obligation (and self-interest) in helping to tackle the growing threat posed by boko haram -- any more than legitimate concerns about generally lackluster leadership by french president françois hollande and the french political elite's failure to deal squarely with the potential for radicalization among segments of the country's marginalized muslim population prevented world leaders from showing their support for france in recent days. as the roman catholic archbishop of jos, nigeria, pleaded on the bbc recently, ""we need that spirit to be spread around...not just when it happens in europe, but when it happens in nigeria, in cameroon."" in the struggle against islamist extremism and for peaceful coexistence and progress, it is time the international community recognized there is no place for a tale of two cities.",j. peter pham: boko haram makes significant territorial strides

"stephenville, texas (cnn)incoherent. talking nonsense. erratic. not the man they knew. that's how family members and friends have described eddie ray routh, the man on trial for the slayings of chris kyle, subject of the hit film ""american sniper,"" and kyle's friend, chad littlefield, at a texas firing range two years ago. no one disputes that routh shot and killed the two men. but defense attorneys say routh was insane. on wednesday, the suspect's sister, brother-in-law and former girlfriend testified about routh's behavior before and after the killings. ""i asked him if he was seeing things, and he said yes,"" jennifer weed, his ex, told the court, describing a conversation that happened the night before the slayings. ""and then i asked him if he was hearing things, and he said yes."" weed testified that routh got out a yellow legal pad and started writing. ""and when i tried to speak to him he would take his hand and cover my mouth because he didn¹t want them to hear what i had to say,"" she said. routh's demeanor after the killings was equally strange. ""he said he had to take two souls before they could take his. and i asked him what he meant by that, and he said they were out to get him,"" laura blevins, his sister, told the court. ""he was talking nonsense."" she said she told him: ""i love you, but i hate your demons."" ""the man who was my brother was not at my house. the person who came to my house is not the man who i knew was my brother,"" blevins testified. her husband said that routh ""babbled about other incoherent things."" ""i had a sick feeling on what it meant,"" gaines blevins told the court. prosecutors have described routh as a troubled young man, but they argue he wasn't insane; they say these are the actions of a cold-blooded killer. on tuesday, prosecutors showed a video of police placing routh into a squad car moments after authorities chased him down a texas highway. in the video, routh is breathing heavily and teary-eyed. an officer asks if he's ok. routh replies: ""i'm just so nervous about what's been happening in my life today. i don't know what's been happening. i've been so paranoid schizophrenic all day. i don't know what to even think of the world right now. i don't know if i'm insane or sane."" the small arsenal of weapons kyle brought to the range that day was shown to the jury, which included five long rifles and several handguns, including one of kyle's rifles labeled ""american sniper."" according to defense attorneys, routh, in his psychotic state, thought he was walking into a showdown on the range. taking the stand for the defense, mother jodi routh described her son's history of mental health problems. after his time serving in the military, she said, ""he was no longer his happy-go-lucky self."" his first stay in a va mental ward was for three days in 2011, she said. then he returned again, against his will, and spent weeks in the facility. when he was released, she said, he was on nine medications, including mood elevators, anti-psychotic medications and sleep aids. jodi routh said she had asked kyle to help, telling him that her son had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. she told kyle that her son had been hospitalized multiple times, but did not tell him that he'd also threatened to kill himself and his family. ""do you regret not sharing that level of detail?"" prosecutor jane starnes asked. ""i just wanted to get help for my son,"" the mother replied. routh's trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about kyle, a former navy seal who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in u.s. history, with 160 confirmed kills in iraq. ""american sniper,"" directed by clint eastwood and starring bradley cooper, has grossed the most ever for a war movie. kyle's autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. he had already risen to fame through his book when he died and was involved in charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. kyle and littlefield took routh to the firing range as a kind of therapy. the range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre rough creek lodge, and the men were isolated. a hunting guide found kyle, 38, and littlefield, 35, kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. the men were dead when officers arrived. correction: earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of chad littlefield, who was killed with chris kyle. littlefield was not a veteran. cnn's catherine e. shoichet and dana ford contributed to this report.","eddie ray routh's sister says he she told him: ""i love you, but i hate your demons"""
"-- myanmar plans to release 651 prisoners starting friday, state television reported, one day after the country's leadership announced a cease-fire with an ethnic rebel group that has waged a bitter, decades-long insurgency for greater autonomy. democracy activists are expected to be among those released throughout the day. on thursday, a cease-fire deal with the karen national union (knu) was widely seen as another attempt by the nominally civilian government to gain greater international credibility. the karen will now be permitted to travel throughout the country, but without weapons, a government official said. karen leaders and activists said it was too early to gauge whether peace would take hold. ""we have to begin with a cease-fire and then proceed to negotiations, with political dialogue taking place later,"" knu vice president saw david thakabaw told the united nations news service earlier. knu leaders said a key problem remains security for civilians living in camps for the internally displaced. they said the government was still sending supplies and troops into karen areas. one of eight prominent ethnic groups in myanmar, the largely christian karen have been fighting in the country's eastern jungles for greater rights since burmese independence from britain in 1948. myra dahgaypaw, a washington-based karen activist with the u.s. campaign for burma, said there are no precise numbers on how many people have suffered in the long-running conflict. just since 1996, she said, government troops have burned down 4,000 karen villages. according to the cia factbook, about 140,000 mostly karen refugees fleeing civil strife, political upheaval and economic stagnation live in remote camps in thailand near the border. many have found new homes in other countries -- about 30,000 are in the united states. dahgaypaw, 35, who spent 17 years in a thailand camp for the displaced, said myanmar's leadership in napidaw had not yet put its stamp of approval on the agreement. she was not ready to celebrate peace just yet. but if it really does take hold, she said, it will mean that many people will be able to finally go back home. ""since independence, we have never experienced basic freedom,"" she said, adding that the karen have had to fight to preserve their culture. ""if we don't fight for it, we will get killed."" national reconciliation has been a key demand of democracy leader aung san suu kyi as well as western powers, including the united states. the cease-fire agreement came on the same day suu kyi's party said it will participate in upcoming elections. ruled by a military junta since 1962, myanmar is now under president thein sein, a former general elected in march, 2011. the new government has instituted rapid reforms but the verdict is still out on whether they are genuine, or merely moves to appease critics. in october, it granted a mass amnesty, which authorities say will eventually free 6,300 prisoners. ""the government is striving for emerging good governance and clean government, flourishing of democratic practices, ensuring rule of law, making economic reform and motivating environmental conservation in building a new peaceful, modern, and developed discipline-flourishing democratic nation,"" the president said then. the opposition website mizzima reported thursday that state-run television had announced another amnesty friday involving 651 prisoners. the obama administration cautiously says it finds the changes encouraging as well as promising. hillary clinton visited myanmar last month, the first visit by a secretary of state in more than a half-century. and last week, suu kyi met with william hague, the first british foreign secretary to visit myanmar in more than 50 years. he called the peace deal ""good news"" after 63 years of fighting. ""it has been a longstanding goal of the international community to see a ceasefire, and indeed it was one of the key issues on which i urged the burmese government to make progress during my visit last week when i also met with karen representatives,"" he said. ""there is still a long way to go fully to rebuild trust between the parties after so many years of conflict, but this is an important step in the right direction."" myanmar, also known as burma, has historically blamed the ethnic rebels for waging attacks to destabilize the government. thursday's announcement coincides with a meeting between u.s. diplomats and suu kyi, a nobel peace prize winner and the face of democracy in myanmar. the u.s. delegation arrived in the country monday and has since met with top government officials. meanwhile thursday, suu kyi's national league for democracy said it will announce a roster of 23 candidates, including suu kyi, with 48 seats up for grabs. the nld won more than 80% of the legislative seats in 1990 -- the first free elections in the country in nearly 30 years -- but the ruling military junta refused to recognize the results. suu kyi has lived most of the past two decades under house detention.she was released in 2010. cnn's kocha olarn contributed to this report.","new: myanmar plans to release 651 prisoners starting friday, state television reports"

"-- phhhhht! blllttt! that's the sound of the whoopee cushion that leslie nielsen placed on the chairs of his co-workers while filming the first ""naked gun"" movie. i was on the set one day during the shoot, working on a feature for the l.a. daily news -- a day punctuated by loud, gassy-sounding eruptions, often followed by nielsen cackling insanely at his juvenile pranks. yep, leslie nielsen, who died yesterday at the age of 84, was that kind of guy. a jokester inside a leading man's body. a straight man with comedic instincts. someone who always knew he was basically chuckles the clown, but didn't get to prove it until he'd been a working actor for nearly 30 years. so while we're chuckling, as we go about our lives today, at the very thought of bumbling lt. frank drebin, and all those other clueless wonders he so effortlessly portrayed, let us give thanks that nielsen got the chance to show us his comedic chops. we are all the richer, and happier, for it. actually, let's thank those zaz guys -- jerry zucker, david zucker and jim abrahams -- the co-directors of the 1980 film ""airplane,"" who cast the canadian actor against type as a dumber-than-dirt doctor, whose response to the line ""surely you can't be serious"" was the classic ""i am serious, and don't call me shirley."" the exchange is so famous, it popped up at no. 79 on the american film institute's list of top 100 movie quotes. leslie nielsen dead at 84 from that point on, nielsen -- who had been making a living as a handsome, but rather stiff, leading man in such films as ""forbidden planet,"" ""tammy and the bachelor"" and ""the poseidon adventure"" -- had found his calling. or, as he put it when people questioned casting him in ""airplane"": ""i've always been cast against type before."" ""airplane,"" of course, led to the short-lived but much beloved tv series ""police squad,"" with nielsen as the utterly bewildered frank drebin. despite its failure on the tube, the zaz guys, seeing its real potential, restructured it as a feature film, 1988's ""the naked gun,"" which was so successful it spawned two sequels. in all these films, and such later work as ""spy hard,"" ""dracula: dead and loving it"" and ""all i want for christmas,"" the nielsen style rapidly became famous: a combination of physical pratfalls, straight-faced delivery, and absurd dialogue aimed straight at 14-year-olds -- and adults who quickly rediscovered the 14-year-old within. ireport: share your memories of leslie nielsen ""it's true what they say,"" says drebin in a typically ridiculous comment from ""the naked gun."" ""cops and women don't mix. it's like eating a spoonful of drano; sure, it'll clean you out, but it'll leave you hollow inside."" always a master at double takes and popeyed wonder, nielsen was a genius when it came to deadpan. no matter what was happening around him, the elegant-looking, silver-haired actor seemed to be in a world of his own, and that was the point. obliviousness became his metier, a means and end in itself, an eternally funny comedic riff that nielsen seemed born to play. he was helped, of course, by the endless non sequiturs in the ""airplane"" and ""naked gun"" scripts, all heavily influenced by the anarchic lunacy of mad magazine. but nielsen's gift was that, unlike comic actors who might give a wink-wink, nudge-nudge to lines like ""it's fourth and 15 and you're looking at a full court press,"" he recited them with a gravity that sounded like it came straight from ""king lear."" who could resist? from drama to comedy, nielsen made it look easy certainly not the critics, who appreciated nielsen's art, if not always the films he appeared in. reviewing ""the naked gun"" in the new york times, janet maslin -- who called the zaz comedy style ""proudly sophomoric"" -- added that the film had an aura of ""unexpected sophistication,"" thanks to the ""dapper presence of leslie nielsen who, as lt. frank drebin, manages to bring something heroic to the role of a perfectly oblivious fall guy."" nielsen, of course, was never really oblivious; he knew exactly what he was doing every second he was onscreen. but unlike a lot of funny guys, who are actually sober and morose in real life, what you saw with nielsen was what you got: he really was a goofball. so when we think about the passing of a man who gave us so much to laugh at, what else is there to say but -- phhhhttttt! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lewis beale.","lewis beale says leslie nielsen pulled on-set pranks during ""naked gun"" shoots"
"a referendum over catalonia's future as a part of spain has been put on hold. spain's constitutional court on monday suspended the planned referendum on independence for spain's catalonia region set to happen on november 9, a court spokeswoman told cnn. the court has suspended the referendum as it consider the grounds of a lawsuit issued by spain's federal government that challenged the planned independence vote as ""unconstitutional."" the president of the catalonia region, artur mas, on saturday had signed a decree setting the date for the vote. even before the constitutional court suspended the plan, the federal government had made it clear that it any such referendum. a legal and political confrontation was expected. the next move is in catalonia's hand -- and whether its leaders decide to go ahead with the vote anyway. the holding of scotland's independence referendum earlier this month buoyed other separatist movements around the world, despite scottish voters opting to remain part of the united kingdom. mas has said that catalonia wants to speak, wants to be heard and wants to vote. on september 11, catalan national day, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of barcelona for the third year running demanding a vote on independence be held. but madrid argues that catalonia, which represents one fifth of spain's economy, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. and it insists that the spanish constitution does not allow any of spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away. catalonia is a region of northeastern spain, with barcelona -- the second-largest city in spain -- as its capital. a referendum is expected to ask a two-part question: ""should catalonia be a state?"" and those who vote yes to that can then go to vote on the second question: ""should that state be independent?"" polls indicate that a majority of catalans want to have a chance to vote but that less than a majority would vote for independence, given the chance.",a top spanish court suspends catalonia's referendum on independence
"-- on sunday we commemorate the courage and sacrifice of 600 men and women who dared 45 years ago to take the first steps in a 54-mile march from selma, alabama, to the state capital, montgomery, for the right to vote. that day, sunday, march 7, 1965, would come to be known as ""bloody sunday."" as these unarmed civil rights patriots attempted to cross the edmund pettus bridge in selma, where fewer than one percent of eligible black voters were allowed to register, they were gassed and beaten with billy clubs by state and local police, some on horseback, ordered to break up the demonstration. captured by television cameras and broadcast nationwide, the suffering of these nonviolent activists, 50 of whom required hospitalization, awoke the nation's consciousness to the importance of voting rights and the entire civil rights movement. within 10 days, president johnson would send a bill to congress, the national voting rights act of 1965, that would outlaw the discriminatory jim crow-era practices that had long worked to disenfranchise african-americans and other minorities across the united states. forty-five years later, the right for which marchers in alabama bled remains out of reach for many americans. in many states, minority voters encounter obstacles at every step of the voting process, from registration to casting a ballot. last month, voting rights advocates filed suit against virginia state election officials, following the advocates' investigation of rejected voter registration applications in 2008 from students at historically african-american norfolk state university and the state officials' subsequent refusal to make certain voter registration records publicly available. while virginia was rejecting minority voter registrations in 2008, colorado was purging voters from its registration rolls. earlier this year, colorado settled a lawsuit brought by mi familia vota and other voting rights advocates. as a result of the colorado suit, usage of lists of purged voters was stayed and the approximately 31,000 voters illegally removed from the registration lists were permitted to cast provisional ballots in the 2008 presidential election. forty-five years after bloody sunday, another march is under way, but it aims to turn back the clock on voting rights. last month, the south carolina state senate passed legislation to require voters to show a photo id before casting a ballot -- a measure that disproportionately excludes low-income, minority, elderly, and student voters, all of whom are less likely than majority voters to have ready access to a government-issued photo id. meanwhile, georgia's secretary of state has vowed to bring a federal court challenge after the u.s. department of justice rejected the state's proposed voter ""verification"" program to identify registrants who may not be citizens. the doj analysis of the program condemned it as highly inaccurate in identifying noncitizens and concluded that it would have a discriminatory effect on minority voters. moreover, on thursday officials in indiana continued their fight to salvage that state's photo id law in arguments to the state's supreme court, after an appellate court held that the law violates equal protection under the state constitution. proponents of photo id and citizenship verification laws claim these measures are needed to protect against voter fraud. the problem with that argument is that they cannot point to any reliable evidence that fraud is a problem. all credible research and expert analysis demonstrates that voter fraud is, at best, extremely rare. and in-person voter fraud -- someone registering to vote as mickey mouse and then showing up at the polls claiming to be mr. mouse -- simply does not exist. these laws are solutions searching for a problem, with what some may describe as the unintended consequence of disenfranchising the most vulnerable voters. in some cases, however, disenfranchising voters is precisely the intended consequence. for example, the republican national committee just appealed a federal court's order to keep in place a 28-year-old consent agreement that prohibited the rnc from engaging in ""security programs"" that have had a disproportionate impact on minorities at the ballot box. the rnc consented to the agreement in 1982 to settle a lawsuit alleging that its so-called security measures -- such as stationing armed off-duty law enforcement officers at minority voting locations and aggressively challenging the rights of eligible minority voters to cast a ballot -- were actually voter intimidation tactics. unable to identify a single instance of in-person voter fraud, the rnc instead argued, in part, that because the president of the united states and the u.s. attorney general are african-american, it is more likely that the government will enforce laws that safeguard against disenfranchising minority voters. in an effort to show their intentions are good, rnc lawyers note that the committee's chairman, michael steele, is african-american. the fact is, voting patterns continue to split along racial and party lines. exit polls from the 2008 presidential election show that while 95 percent of african-americans, 67 percent of latinos, and 62 percent of asian-americans voted for barack obama nationally, only 43 percent of whites did. as the federal judge noted in this case, the rnc ""has been largely unsuccessful in its efforts to attract minority voters."" so long as these patterns endure, the rnc will continue to have what the judge termed an ""incentive"" to engage in racially motivated voter suppression. there is no doubt that we have come a long way since bloody sunday. sadly, however, there is also no doubt that the need to fight for voting rights continues. instead of going back to a dark era of our history by putting needless obstacles in front of minority voters, congress and the states should press ahead to break down the remaining barriers that block eligible voters from exercising their constitutional rights. we should start by modernizing the voter registration system by making it more automated and keeping eligible voters on the rolls permanently. we should take voting out of the artificial confines created by a limited and literal ""election day"" by providing for universal early voting. to live up to our constitutional mandate to continue to form a more perfect union -- and to truly honor the brave men and women who marched and were beaten and bloodied, and especially those who were murdered defending their right to vote -- we have the duty to ensure that every eligible voter has an equal and meaningful opportunity to cast a ballot and have it counted.

"-- one of the many questions surrounding the revelation that americans kent brantly and nancy writebol received a little-known, experimental serum for their ebola infection is: ""why did we hear nothing about it earlier, and how did they gain access to it?"" ebola has no cure, although potential medications and vaccines are in various states of development. the serum zmapp, an experimental product of mapp biopharmaceutical, hasn't been tested in humans, which means it doesn't meet a primary requirement for fda approval -- so its obscurity is no surprise. the americans managed to gain access to what more than 1,660 infected people in guinea, sierra leone, liberia and now nigeria did not: medicine that seems to work -- although, of course, we don't know for sure yet. some reports indicate they received zmapp under the fda's ""compassionate use"" rule, which permits untested drugs to be given to consenting patients who might otherwise die. this is a triumph of common sense and compassion over bureaucratic red tape. one of the chief concerns about using unapproved medications is that we don't know what the risks are: the drug may not work, it may work with serious adverse effects, or it may prove as deadly as the disease. but as a doctor, brantly understood the risks, and like him, writebol had no other options. most people with ebola die. compassionate use is certainly ethically defensible. but apparently only three doses were available, and they were given to westerners. the lack of broader access to zmapp highlights what is often a very serious ethical failing. 9 questions about this new ebola drug why didn't dr. sheik umar khan, the chief sierra leone physician who died while treating ebola patients, receive this medication? because another method of determining who gets medications is at work here -- the drearily familiar stratification of access to a drug based on economic resources and being a westerner rather than a resident of the global south. no health worker wants to intentionally deprive africans of a needed drug. but informal medical networks, which africans lack, connect well-to-do westerners with information and drugs. in addition, the pharmaceutical industry has a history of declining to test medications for diseases of the tropical world, most of whose inhabitants cannot afford high prices. we don't know how quickly zmapp could be made in large quantities. if it were to be made available, who should receive it? some think ebola doctors and caregivers should, because their survival is essential to treating and quelling the epidemic. this makes sense, but it's not that simple. first, it violates the principle of distributive justice: the benefits of the drug are being inequitably distributed, with skilled, economically secure professionals more likely to benefit. also, by what reckoning do we decide that the doctors' role increases their value and dictates they should be given a preferential chance to survive? distributing the drug through a clinical trial would allow us to know whether and how well the medication works and what caveats might apply. africans must participate in any clinical trial, which would benefit the pharmaceutical company as well as, it's hoped, ebola victims. this would mean their lives have irreplaceable value, too, in the equation of who should get the drug. so, will africans receive this potentially lifesaving medication? a u.n. official suggested that drugs cannot be tested in the middle of an epidemic -- but he is wrong. such tests are conducted all the time. dr. david ho tested aids drugs in uganda in the midst of the pandemic, and the meningitis drug trovan was tested in kano, nigeria, in the midst of an epidemic. one of every three industry trials is conducted in developing countries; scientists often point to high disease rates, including epidemics, as a rationale for conducting them there. the problem is not testing the drug amid an epidemic. the question is how ethically such trials are conducted. only small amounts of zmapp are available now, but as soon as it can be made in quantity, the drug for ebola should be made available to africans in all the regions that are threatened by the epidemic, regardless of ability to pay. if possible, it should be distributed within clinical trials to determine the safety and efficiency of the medications. many people assume this requires withholding medications in a control group, but this is not necessarily the case. experts should and can mount a well-designed study that permits early access to the medication to all who need it. but if they cannot ensure that sick people get the drug early, then a clinical trial should not be any more of a requirement for poor africans than it was for kent brantly. it's also natural to wonder whether the threat of ebola to the western world, not to africans, drives this initiative because so few such drugs are devised for africans. this simply highlights another reason why we should so our utmost to protect people from ebola: our medical interdependence. if ebola makes landfall in the united states, we will need drugs like zmapp, just as africans need them today.",americans with ebola received an experimental medicine that seemed to help

"-- already devastated this year by a killer earthquake and a deadly cholera outbreak, haiti felt the brute force friday of hurricane tomas, which could dump up to 15 inches of rain and trigger flash floods and mudslides. the hurricane's punishing rain continued to pound haiti even as the storm churned away from hispaniola. as of 8 p.m. et, the storm's center was about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of guantanamo, cuba, and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of great inagua island in the bahamas, according to the national hurricane center in miami, florida. earlier friday, tomas had passed within about 140 miles (230 kilometers) of port-au-prince. in the westernmost tip of haiti, which juts into the caribbean sea and is closest to the hurricane, there were reports from the town of jeremie of destroyed houses, downed trees and flooded rivers, said francois desruisseaux, an emergency team leader with care in haiti. also, he said, care workers near the coastal city of leogane reported the area has been inundated with several feet of water. downtown streets turned into rivers, said desruisseaux. tomas was also felt in port-au-prince, the nation's capital, but the worst of the storm appeared to have passed there after rain pounded the city overnight. by friday afternoon, rain had stopped falling. it started again in fits and spurts later. ""we were expecting something perhaps a little larger, but it's still quite significant,"" desruisseaux said about hurricane tomas, adding that rescue teams throughout haiti are still working to assess the damage. ""in the capital so far, we've been relatively lucky, all things considered."" the threat of ongoing rain remains real, as does the possibility of the spread of waterborne diseases, desruisseaux said. relief worker roseann dennery of samaritan's purse was near cabaret, about 20 miles north of port-au-prince, on friday morning, touring camps that hold some of the 1 million people left homeless by january's 7.0-magnitude earthquake, which killed some 250,000 people. ""it's almost eerie,"" she said. ""it's rainy, it's dark and there's really not a lot of movement."" the few people moving from tent to tent were wrapped in sheets and cloth to provide some protection against the constant rain, she said. the ground was soaked and some low-lying areas had minor flooding. some people rode out the storm in open-air community centers with supposedly sturdy roofs, she said. but many just huddled in their tents, waiting for the wind and rain to pass. most didn't have anywhere else to go. ""a lot of them do not have families or relatives,"" said dennery. many structures that would usually be used for storm shelters -- schools and hospitals -- are no longer standing. she said her agency, an international christian relief organization, evacuated 30 staff members from leogane out of fear of mudslides there. michael dockrey, the director in haiti for the international medical corps, also expressed his deep concern friday. ""particularly,"" he told cnn, ""with mudslides that can cut off whole communities. we have pre-positioned medical supplies, tents, tarps and staff in areas that we know will be isolated."" aid workers already were struggling to keep up with the cholera outbreak, which has killed nearly 450 people and hospitalized about 7,000. the bacterial disease causes diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to deadly dehydration within hours. ""it's obviously stretched us all real thin,"" dockrey said. ""we could certainly use more help ... as can all the other responders."" the hurricane will likely only make matters worse. ""even if tomas only brushes haiti, it may exacerbate the epidemic, facilitating the spread of the disease into and throughout metropolitan port-au-prince, where a third of the population remains homeless and in camps,"" the international organization for migration said. tomas became a category 1 hurricane as it approached haiti early friday, forecasters said. it was previously a category 2 hurricane and then weakened to a tropical depression before reintensifying. forecasters predict the storm could strengthen during the next 24 hours before weakening again saturday night and sunday. the biggest threats were mudslides and flash flooding, said cnn meteorologist reynolds wolf. port-au-prince is bounded on three sides by hills, and rain runoff could cause flooding, wolf said. the low-lying port city also borders the caribbean sea. winds from the storm had slowed to 75 mph (120 kph), the hurricane center said friday evening, adding that tomas was moving northeast at 14 mph (22 kph). the eye of the storm was expected to pass near or over the southeastern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands friday night or early saturday. rain associated with the storm started falling on haiti on thursday as aid agencies scrambled to move as many people as possible into storm shelters. as it did after the earthquake, the united states offered its assistance. the u.s agency for international development had pre-positioned supplies, but rushed more into the country before the airport closed ahead of the storm, said mark ward, acting director of the office of foreign disaster assistance. citing haitian authorities, ward said at a friday briefing for reporters that about half the residents at temporary camps left those facilities overnight to stay with family or friends. he said the haitian government has confirmed one fatality. in addition, the u.s. navy redirected the uss iwo jima to haiti from suriname, where the ship's crew was conducting a four-month humanitarian mission. in addition to search-and-rescue-trained helicopter crews, the ship is carrying more than 200 medical personnel and 60 navy construction engineers who can help with recovery efforts. the ship is also carrying a 500-member marine task force and personnel from nongovernmental relief agencies. negus, who participated in the navy response to the earthquake, said he did not expect the fallout from tomas to be anywhere near as severe. ""it's everyone's prayer here that our capabilities will not be required,"" negus said.

"-- venezuelan president hugo chavez revealed a deeply personal side in an interview thursday night, saying he loves jesus christ and would have liked to play major league baseball in yankee stadium. venezuelan president hugo chavez spoke highly of president obama at the united nations on thursday. he also expressed a fondness for american people and culture, saying he likes the movie actor charles bronson and the poet walt whitman. he loves to sing, he said, though he does not do it well. and chavez had kind words for the u.s. security detail protecting him during his visit to new york, saying he chatted with them while out walking and that they ""have been very gracious, very efficient and very attentive, very kind."" in an exclusive interview with cnn's larry king, chavez spoke at length about a host of issues: relations between venezuela and the united states and his hopes for improved ties with president barack obama; iran, israel and those who deny that the holocaust existed; efforts to overthrow him and have him assassinated; criticism that he is power hungry and trying to silence critics. chavez, a self-proclaimed socialist, spoke with king a few hours after giving a speech to the u.n. general assembly, in which he praised obama but criticized some u.s. policies. watch chavez speak at the u.n. general assembly » when asked whether he is misunderstood in the united states, chavez seemed to turn reflective. ""i'm a man with many defects,"" he said. ""i love. i sing. i dream. i was born in the poor countryside. i was raised in the countryside, planting corn and selling sweets made by my grandmother. my children, my two daughters are with me and i want a better world for my grandchildren, for your grandchildren. ""now, they demonize me. but that's the start of these world campaigns to try to defend what you cannot defend -- a system that is destroying the world. ... i'm a christian. i want the world of justice and equality. this is the only way to achieve peace."" chavez then talked about his religious upbringing and current faith. ""i was an altar boy,"" he said. ""my mother wanted me to be a priest. i am very christian and catholic. ... i'm very faithful. i believe in god, in jesus christ. i love jesus christ. i am a christian. ... i cry when i see injustice, children dying of hunger."" his comments were all the more remarkable because chavez and the catholic church have been at odds since he came to power in 1999. the church has been one of his major critics, with pope benedict xvi and other church leaders expressing concern over what they see as attempts by chavez to limit the church's influence. chavez's efforts to change anti-abortion laws have been at the top of those concerns. chavez, in turn, has referred to church leadership as a ""tumor."" speaking of other matters, chavez said he hopes for improved relations with obama, but ""we want relations based on respect, relations of peoples where we are respected."" that has not been the case so far, he said. ""most governments in the united states in a hundred years have not respected the peoples of latin america,"" chavez told king. ""they have sponsored coup d'etats, assassinations. it's enough. we want to be brothers and sisters. we want respect and equality."" chavez particularly criticized former president george w. bush, whom he accused of orchestrating an assassination attempt on the venezuelan leader during a short-lived coup in 2002. chavez regained power within days. watch chavez discuss the alleged assassination attempt » ""the bush government toppled me,"" he said. ""they asked for my assassination. they disrespected us. ... i saw my assassins. ... i was a prisoner in venezuela, being a president. they took me to the seaside. i was debating with those who wanted murder me. they received the order to kill me. however, at this very moment, a group of soldiers refused. they did not kill me, but i saw those who wanted to kill me, and the order came from the white house."" chavez also expressed concern that the united states, which he calls ""the empire,"" still would like to topple him. as he has numerous times in recent weeks, chavez criticized u.s. plans to begin operating out of military bases in neighboring colombia. the united states says it needs a presence in colombia to fight drug traffickers. chavez sees a sinister intent. when asked what country he fears would harm him, chavez replied, ""the empire. the empire. seven military bases ... in colombia, that's a serious threat against venezuela."" chavez also defended his relationship with iran but denied having said that iran would help venezuela obtain nuclear technology. iran has embarked on a nuclear program that the united states and other nations think will lead it to develop nuclear weapons before long. ""they have fooled you,"" chavez said. ""i've never said that iran is going to help us to have nuclear technology. ... that's a strategy to attack venezuela and say that we are building an atomic bomb. that's the next accusation. and i'm going to say this now: please, come on. that's crazy. that's crazy."" chavez said he does not agree with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad's contention that the holocaust, in which 6 million european jews were killed during world war ii, never existed. ""but there also was another holocaust in south america,"" chavez said. ""i do not deny the jewish holocaust. and i condemn it. but in south america, when the europeans arrived, there were close to 90 million indians; 200 years later, we only had four million remaining. that was a holocaust. and the europeans denied this holocaust."" israel came under criticism from chavez, who called it a ""small country with atomic bombs, and very aggressive country. ... they have massacred entire families. it is a war-mongering country."" turning to the situation in his own country, chavez denied that he is trying to shut down critical media, such as the independent globovision tv station. government officials have levied several charges against the station, saying that it is disseminating false information and trying to foment dissatisfaction against chavez. the chavez government has repealed licenses for other independent tv and radio stations, and has threatened to do so against globovision. former u.s. president jimmy carter this week joined human rights groups and others who have expressed concern over what they see as chavez becoming too authoritarian. chavez dismissed the criticism. ""never in venezuela have we had so much freedom of speech as now,"" he said. pressed by king about whether he is going to shut down globovision, chavez answered, ""i do not know. it depends on them. if they keep on sponsoring coup d'etats, if they keep on calling for my assassination, if they keep on breaching the law even as well, it is not chavez that's going to close them. i want to apply the law. we need to respect the law. it is the law. it's out of logic, and it's pure logic."" as to carter, chavez said, ""yes, i read that and i regret for him, because i think he's totally confounded and lost. it's a long time since he visited us. i respect him enormously, but i think he is wrong. he's a victim of so much falsehood in the world.""","venezuelan president hugo chavez says he loves jesus christ, u.s. people, culture"

"what's worse than 7 feet of snow piled up in front of your house? how about the flooding that comes once those 7 feet of snow melt? that's exactly what some buffalonians will grapple with when temperatures monday warm up to around 60 degrees. swift-water rescue teams and helicopters are already on standby in western new york in case anyone gets caught in a deluge. new york gov. andrew cuomo said residents shouldn't wait until the last minute to evacuate if they think their homes will get inundated. he advised such homeowners to clear their basements of valuables. the governor said dealing with flooding is worse than the snow. ""it's not water,"" cuomo said. ""it's a toxic brew. it has sewage in it; it has runoff in it."" state officials have beefed up stockpiles of generators and pumps and prepared almost 180,000 sandbags. after last week's nationwide bout with frigid weather, buffalo temperatures could reach as 60 on monday, according to the national weather service. freezing temperatures are not expected again until tuesday night. ""at least 3 feet of snow has melted so far,"" dawn buck of depew, new york, told cnn's ireport on sunday afternoon. but erie county spokesman benjamin swanekamp said so far, the snow has been melting at a ""relatively even pace."" ""the pace of the melting and the lack of additional rain has kept it manageable,"" swanekamp said late sunday night. about 700,000 people are under a flood warning until wednesday, cnn meteorologist pedram javaheri said. officials have been moving pumps into neighborhoods and sandbags near creeks. so far, the county hasn't received reports of major flooding. but cuomo has asked residents to clean out storm drains in front of their houses ""so the water has some place to go."" collapsing roofs there's also the threat of more building collapses as all the rain saturates the snow on the tops of buildings, making the load even heavier. several dozen roofs have already collapsed from just the weight of the snow, erie county officials said. while most of the fallen buildings were unoccupied, swanekamp said, a roof collapse at a dairy barn roof killed 25 cattle cuomo said structural engineers will examine schools and other government buildings that might be in danger of roof collapses. he said most state government offices will reopen monday. nasty winds too the national weather service in buffalo issued a high wind warning from monday afternoon until early tuesday morning. high wind warnings are issued when sustained winds of at least 40 miles per hour are expected for at least an hour, with gusts of at least 58 mph at any time. the winds could topple trees and power lines, officials said. and with ongoing snow melt, the saturated ground will make it easier for some trees to come down.

"-- with the inevitability of mitt romney's gop presidential nomination now assured, the next question looming in this long, twisted election cycle is likely to be this: which mitt romney will be running against president barack obama? in a perfect mitt world, romney would have been able to stay in his comfort zone, touting his economic prowess vs. the nation's (read: obama's) economic failures. but a covey of conservative republican opponents fueled with super pac money and jazzed by tea party frenzy forced him from the middle and into an increasingly conservative persona, culminating in his somewhat plaintive declaration that he was ""severely"" conservative. with his need to compete for the republican right now ebbing, will romney migrate back to the center, hoping that a good shake of the etch a sketch will create a clean slate to start courting moderates and independents? he can only wish it were that easy. there is little doubt that romney, like most presidential candidates before him, will recast his message for a general election. his problem in doing so, however, is his well-established record as a political chameleon who changes colors to match the polemics of his strongest political rival. in a weird through-the-looking-glass transformation that echoes through romney's political career, mitt the candidate often takes on some of the positions and personality traits of his opponents. when he challenged ted kennedy for the u.s. senate seat in 1994, romney became moderate mitt, staking out a painfully sincere middle ground stance on abortion. watching him in debate with kennedy, viewers can be excused for thinking they have wandered into an earlier ""saturday night live"" skit. romney's tortured answer wiggles one way -- he says he will support and defend roe v. wade -- then wiggles the other by saying his family, including his mom, had its own beliefs ""but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter. and you will not see me wavering on that."" kennedy puts it more simply. ""i support pro-choice,"" he says. ""my opponent is multiple choice."" the line drew a burst of applause. romney ran a similar campaign for governor in 2002, modeling the same moderate positions of the two liberal republican governors who preceded him. he took the same tortured tack on abortion as in 1994; his campaign courted log cabin republicans, promising, according to members who attended a meeting, to be a supporter of gay rights and to stay out of the gay marriage case making its way through the state courts. there was little change in his political stance in the first year of his governorship. no social initiatives came out of the governor's office. most of his work revolved around the annual budget process, a beacon hill ritual in which the governor, republican or democrat, presents a budget to the massachusetts legislature, which quickly dismantles the plan and replaces it with its own agenda, overriding any eventual veto attempts by the governor. then came two events that forced the governor out of his comfort zone of moderation. the first was the state's supreme judicial court's 2003 ruling that a ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. with his eyes already set on the white house, romney faced the unplanned prospect of running for president as the governor from the first same-sex marriage state in the union. fortunately for him, however, he had no real constitutional power to do anything other than to act as a sideline cheerleader for a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed civil unions but not same-sex marriage. the amendment eventually failed in the legislature. in the meantime, romney did some executive huffing and puffing, summoning up a dusty 1914 miscegenation statute that barred out-of-state couples from marrying in massachusetts if their union was prohibited at home. the order was dropped after municipal clerks complained about the extra work it would bring. but mostly romney was able to use rhetoric to play to conservatives while taking no action that would offend the liberals. perhaps the more significant, and less noted, event that forced romney to switch his protective coloring was the resignation in september 2004 of house speaker tom finneran, a staunch social conservative who ruled the massachusetts house with an iron hand. a singular power in the legislature, finneran controlled all action in the house, keeping liberal proposals from advancing out of committee. with finneran as sentinel, romney was spared from making any decisions on legislation that could haunt him in republican primaries. finneran's departure in advance of federal obstruction of justice charges -- he eventually pleaded guilty -- forced romney to drop his massachusetts mitt persona. with a more liberal democratic speaker in place, who is now doing time in federal prison, romney had no place to hide as hot-button issues such as stem cell research, the morning-after pill and various bills on sexual orientation rights escaped the legislature and made it onto his desk. he faced a turning point. sign those bills and safeguard his position for another run for governor or oppose them to curry favor with the more conservative republican voters he would need to win a presidential nomination. he chose the latter, beginning his long public transformation to severely conservative mitt. even back then, reporters covering the massachusetts state house could anticipate carefully crafted statements by romney on any social issue likely to come up when he shared the dais with republican presidential primary rivals. his one major legacy as governor -- the health care reform bill for which massachusetts democrats now honor him -- was part of that same romney political calculus. when he collaborated with the democratic leadership to pass the law, the central fixture of individual mandate was within a general republican ideology for reforming health care. but romney's dream of being the savior of the health care crisis became a nightmare when conservatives demonized a democratic president for the same legislation. romney couldn't get a break from his massachusetts legacy. in the last two years of his governorship, romney was out of state campaigning for president more often than he was in his state house office. his campaign patter often included digs at liberal massachusetts, such as the time he described himself as ""a vegetarian at a cattle ranch."" the tactic didn't increase the love in massachusetts. in march 2005, he had a 55-to-41 favorable to unfavorable rating. those numbers continued to decline over the next two years. by november 2006, as his term was ending, his numbers dropped to 37-to-52 favorable to unfavorable. only 29% said they would vote for him again. some say romney's shifting persona is nothing new to american politics. even abraham lincoln tailored his message to the audience or electorate he was trying to woo. but the politicians who win elections and leave legacies keep to core ideals. romney may have such ideals tucked away in a lockbox, but who can tell? his often ham-handed attempts to win over whatever demographic he is targeting this week creates a stink of insincerity that trails him even when he actually means what he says. that will be the problem for whichever romney we see over the next months. whatever message he chooses, part of the audience will wonder if the mitt romney they are seeing will be the same one they might vote for. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of fred bayles.","fred bayles: romney

"-- former philippine president corazon aquino, whose ""people power"" movement pushed out longtime strongman ferdinand marcos less than three years after her husband's assassination, has died at age 76, her family announced saturday. ""she was the agent of change in philippine democracy,"" said ray donato, the nation's consul-general in atlanta. aquino, the first woman to lead the philippines, had been battling colon cancer since march 2008 and died of cardio-respiratory arrest at 3:18 a.m. saturday (3:18 p.m. friday et), said mai mislang, a spokeswoman for her son, philippine sen. benigno aquino iii. funeral arrangements were being set up, mislang said. philippine president gloria macapagal arroyo has also announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president, said ray donato, the country's consul-general in atlanta. ""she was the agent of change in philippine democracy, and almost all the filipinos i know revered her during her presidency,"" donato said. aquino had been born into a wealthy family and was educated in the united states. she had not been involved in politics before her husband, opposition leader benigno ""ninoy"" aquino jr., was gunned down at manila's airport in august 1983 as he returned from exile. the political novice took over the leadership of her husband's movement after his death and challenged marcos in a 1986 election, making a yellow dress her trademark and bolstered by the support of the country's roman catholic churches. marcos had been backed by the united states, the former colonial power in the philippines, for two decades as a stalwart anti-communist. he and his wife imelda were friends of then-president ronald reagan and his wife, nancy. but widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a mutiny by the country's military led the reagan administration to withdraw its support, and marcos went into exile in hawaii. aquino took office in a country with a $28 billion debt, widespread poverty and a persistent marxist insurgency. she put in place a u.s.-style constitution that limited presidents to a single six-year term and survived seven coup attempts -- including one that was supressed with american help. she also oversaw the closure of the major u.s. military bases in the country before leaving office in 1992. the bases had been a bulwark of american power in the pacific since the early 1900s and employed nearly 80,000 filipinos, but aquino's opponents argued the country was too dependent on the united states. aquino announced in 1990 that it was time to begin negotiating the ""orderly withdrawal"" of u.s. forces.","new: funeral arrangements are being set up, spokeswoman says"
"san diego, california (cnn) -- welcome to 2010. what is your new year's resolution? are you planning on investing more money into the annual $40 billion dieting industry? if so, please think again. as we start our workweek, many of us are looking in the mirror and saying ""yuck. i feel fat, uncomfortable and need to go on a diet."" dieting and the language of ""fat"" have become so normal that we don't think twice before we say, ""i have to go on a diet, i have gained so much weight."" if we are parents of teenagers, we may as well be saying to them, ""change yourself, fix your body. you're not perfect and never will be."" is this how we want to empower our youth? you spend countless hours raising your child with the values of honesty, integrity and the importance of the work ethic. but if you are dieting and complaining about how fat you are, you could be putting your teenager at risk for an eating disorder. as a psychologist who has been treating eating disorders since 1985, i worry that there could be a connection between dieting parents and teenagers who develop anorexia or bulimia. the 6-year-old girl who is watching her mother suck in her stomach in front of the mirror is going to look at her belly poking out and immediately think that she is fat. how awful that we just inadvertently planted the seed of lifelong discontent with her body into the innocent mind of a 6-year-old. we have to be mindful of what we really want to emphasize as important. in this quick-fix world of botox, plastic surgery and fad diets, our children are not being taught how to tolerate discomfort and how to work hard and patiently. ""now"" is the demand word that parents feel compelled to cater to. we could be creating a generation of self-obsessed, narcissistic children. do we really want them to feel that the glamour of ""gossip girl"" is the goal of their lives? we must draw the line by examining our own core values. the majority of us know that the quick fix is not going to work, yet we feel compelled to throw ourselves into the despair of broken diets, broken resolutions, broken promises and worse, a pervasive sense of shame that attacks the core of our being. we are so inundated with messages that are constantly redefining what is healthy that in our confusion we forget what is normal eating and a healthy, balanced lifestyle. the ""diet monster"" gobbles up our self-esteem and makes us return to that unfaithful lover again and again, only to drop more money into that $40 billion pot. we could use that money to educate millions of brains each year, better our schools, reduce poverty and attend to our elderly. of course, eating healthily and staying active are very important. but of those who lose weight through dieting, 98 percent gain it back again in two years. diet is a four-letter word that begins with ""die."" isn't that ominous enough? this year, create an intention not to diet. when you do this, you are consciously rejecting the appearance-obsessed, materialistic culture that inundates us. an intention to honor your soul instead of your appearance -- to choose to give back in the community, volunteer, give time to the elderly -- will make you feel stronger. instead of spending time counting calories or going obsessively to the gym, donate those hours to a shelter for abused women. love your body. this year, make it your intention to teach your teenager to reject the appearance-obsessed world she lives in and have her give her heart instead of changing her body. caution: this approach might make you start to love your body and you may waver on your new year's resolution to lose weight! as january unfolds, we are going to be blasted with commercials from multiple sources, with each one touting a permanent relief. the net result of these commercials is to get us to continue to hate our bodies so that these diet companies can make money off our body hatred. there is also a political reason for women to be held to a high ""thin"" standard of perfection. we are then no longer a threat to anyone who wants power. ""body wars"" keep women in their place and are economically driven. let us assert our power by rejecting the dieting mantra, standing our ground -- and being full of ourselves. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of divya kakaiya.",divya kakaiya: dieting means giving money to the annual $40 billion diet industry
"-- a member of the group dubbed the ""jena 6"" is facing misdemeanor assault charges after a fight at his texas high school wednesday, police said thursday. bryant purvis was arrested after a fight wednesday at his texas high school, police said. bryant purvis, 19, was arrested after the incident at hebron high school in carrollton, texas. carrollton police sgt. john singleton told cnn the altercation does not appear to be racially motivated. school officials contacted police about the fight wednesday morning. an 18-year-old student told authorities two males approached him and asked if he had flattened the tires of ""their homeboy's"" car, according to an affidavit supporting the arrest warrant. the student said he didn't, but the two told him they didn't believe him and walked away. purvis, he said, approached him from behind immediately afterward, then grabbed him with one hand and began to choke him. ""purvis continued to choke [the student] and told him, 'don't you ever mess with my car again,'"" the affidavit said. ""purvis then pushed his head into the seating area of the bench,"" causing the student to strike his left eye, then walked away. the affidavit said that in a written statement, purvis wrote, ""i walked over to him and grabbed him by his neck, then told him not to mess with my car anymore, then i left."" police reported the student had marks on his neck and bruising on his eye. a municipal judge set purvis' bond at $1,000, and he was transferred to the denton county detention facility, singleton said. purvis is one of six former students in jena, louisiana, accused of being involved in the beating of a white student. he initially was charged with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy, but charges against him were reduced in november to second-degree aggravated battery. he is awaiting trial in that case. civil rights leaders martin luther king iii and al sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- in september to protest how authorities handled the cases against purvis and the five others accused in the december 2006 beating of fellow student justin barker. after his arraignment in november, purvis told reporters he had moved to another town to complete high school. e-mail to a friend","bryant purvis, 19, is facing misdemeanor assault charges, police say"
"-- french shoemaker christian louboutin is seeing red -- and will likely be seeing a lot more of it -- after a judge in manhattan denied an injunction that would have kept fellow designer yves saint laurent from selling shoes with red soles. the lawsuit, filed in june, takes issue with four specific shoes from ysl's cruise 2011 collection: the tribute, tribtoo, palais and woodstock models, claiming the shoes violate louboutin's trademarked ""lacquered red sole."" ""everyone sees the flash of red and associates the red with louboutin,"" attorney harley lewin said thursday about his client. in fact, louboutin's red soles have graced many a red carpets, adorning the feet of celebrities oprah winfrey, heidi klum and sarah jessica parker. in 2009, jennifer lopez wrote a song about them, ""but it's the last time, i'm movin' on, i'm throwing on my louboutins."" in his decision wednesday, u.s. district judge victor marrero acknowleded that in choosing a red sole for his shoes, louboutin had ""departed from longstanding conventions and norms of his industry,"" to create a product, ""so eccentric and striking that it is easily perceived and remembered."" however, marrero went on to say that, ""louboutin's claim to the 'the color red' is, without some limitation, overly broad and inconsistent with the scene of trademark registration."" ""this was a trademark that never should've been issued,"" david bernstein, attorney for the defendant, yves saint laurent said. he adds, ""ysl has been using red since the 1970s, other designers have used red on the soles of their shoes. they aren't doing so to confuse people, but because it's a design aesthetic."" lewin thinks the judge went too far. ""this is no longer about the case,"" he said. judge marrero's decision drew parallels between painters and fashion designers, calling them both members of a creative industry where no one should be barred from using color to achieve their aesthetic. doing so could, ""interfere with creativity and stifle competition."" bernstein agrees. ""no designer should be able to monopolize a color."" there have been cases when companies have copyrighted color. owens corning, for example, has the trademark for pink fiberglass. marrero said industrial products are different because the application of color is simply to distinguish one manufacturer from another. lewin says his client ""separated his shoes from everyone else's by using a red sole."" lewin said he's never had such an outpouring from his fellow attorneys, law professors and members of the fashion industry, telling him, ""this [verdict] is an abomination. tell your client to appeal."" on august 17, both sides will meet for a case management conference, and lewin says he will announce his plans to do just that.

"-- you're in a room with 10 other people who seem to agree on something, but you hold the opposite view. do you say something? or do you just go along with the others? imaging techniques help scientists look at the basis for principles of social psychology in the brain. decades of research show people tend to go along with the majority view, even if that view is objectively incorrect. now, scientists are supporting those theories with brain images. a new study in the journal neuron shows when people hold an opinion differing from others in a group, their brains produce an error signal. a zone of the brain popularly called the ""oops area"" becomes extra active, while the ""reward area"" slows down, making us think we are too different. ""we show that a deviation from the group opinion is regarded by the brain as a punishment,"" said vasily klucharev, postdoctoral fellow at the f.c. donders centre for cognitive neuroimaging at radboud university nijmegen in the netherlands and lead author of the study. watch to learn more about the study » participants, all female, had to rate 222 faces based on physical beauty on a scale from 1 to 8. afterwards, researchers told each participant either that the average score was higher or that it was lower than her rating. some participants were told the average rating was equal to her rating. the researchers then chatted with the participant before suddenly asking the participant to do the rating again. most subjects changed their opinion toward the average. the two leading theories of conformity are that people look to the group because they're unsure of what to do, and that people go along with the norm because they are afraid of being different, said dr. gregory berns, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at emory university school of medicine in atlanta, georgia. berns' research, which he describes in the book ""iconoclast: a neuroscientist reveals how to think differently,"" found that brain mechanisms associated with fear and anxiety do play a part in situations where a person feels his or her opinion goes against the grain. participants looked at projections of three-dimensional objects, and had to identify which shapes were similar. as with the new study in neuron, participants tended to shift their opinion to the majority view, although in this case the problems had objectively correct answers. the effect was also more potent in this experiment because actors were in the room to simulate a group with a shared opinion, he said. but brain images revealed participants were not lying just to fit in. changes in the activation of the visual part of the brain suggest the group opinion actually changed participants' perceptions of what they saw. one reason behind conformity is that, in terms of human evolution, going against the group is not beneficial to survival, berns said. there is a tremendous survival advantage to being in a community, he said. ""our brains are exquisitely tuned to what other people think about us, aligning our judgments to fit in with the group,"" berns said. the most famous experiments in the field were conducted by solomon asch in the 1950s. he found that many people gave incorrect answers about matching lines printed on cards, echoing the incorrect answers of the actors in the room. but unlike berns' finding that fear and anxiety relate to this effect, asch saw conformity studies reflections of people's reliance on one another for knowledge of the world, experts say. the darker side of conformity relates to stanley milgram's experiments of the 1960s and 1970s, in which most people obeyed orders to deliver electric shocks to an innocent person in the next room. as in these studies, subjects caved into social pressure, presumably going against their own previous moral convictions. read more about the milgram study the research calls into question decision-making bodies that operate by consensus, berns said. for example, in the u.s. legal system, many cases are decided by the unanimous judgment of the members of a jury. ""you can't separate those judgments from the fact that you have 12 people who have to come to a unanimous decision, and have to conform their opinion to each other, so of course it will distort how they view evidence,"" he said. ""any type of group decision-making process that does not require unanimous decisions is likely to make a better one,"" berns said. ""that applies to committees in particular."" what does it take to break the conformity effect? asch talked about the power of the ""minority of one."" when a unanimous group pressures the individual, that group is weakened as soon as one person breaks off. ""anyone inclined to draw too pessimistic conclusions from this report would do well to remind himself that the capacities for independence are not to be underestimated,"" asch wrote in a 1955 ""scientific american"" article describing his research. ""he may also draw some consolation from a further observation: those who participated in this challenging experiment agreed nearly without exception that independence was preferable to conformity.""",new study looks at how people change opinions of the beauty of images
"washington (cnn)while mitt romney announced he wouldn't run for president on friday, he had personally come to that decision a week prior -- well before he made campaign-style stop in starkville mississippi, on wednesday that kept the national press scrutinizing his every statement for any hints about his political future. he shook hands and took selfies with young voters, attacked hillary clinton in a high profile speech, and laid out his thoughts about foreign and domestic policy—all signs that suggested he was gearing up for a third presidential bid. but a closer look at the day's events—and the benefit of hindsight—reveal some clues that romney knew at the time he wouldn't be throwing his hat in the ring. he talked more about the past than the future speaking at mississippi state university, romney spent the first half of his speech talking almost entirely about his 2012 campaign when he was the republican nominee. many of the light-hearted and funny moments in the speech occurred while romney used self-deprecating humor to describe the last presidential cycle. ""you may not have heard: i lost,"" romney said towards the beginning of his speech. he drew a big laugh from the audience when he said a supporter once advised him to stop shaving so he can ""grow a little more stubble for a few days to look more sexy."" ""as if i needed that,"" romney continued flatly. he lovingly recalled people he met on the campaign trail, labeling some of his most devoted followers in iowa and new hampshire ""heroes"" because they adamantly supported someone they believed in. he described the campaign as one of ""the most remarkable of my life's journeys"" but spoke with a tone of finality when recalling that it would eventually come to an end. ""what we knew at the beginning was that win or lose, any acclaim would eventually be forgotten,"" he said. ""as the 1940s song jimmy durante used to sing: 'fame if you win it, comes and goes in a minute.'"" granted, it's a line he has used in previous speeches, but it's an example of how he was in a reflective mood. he declined to answer a question from the moderator about how he would run a potential campaign differently from 2012—""that's another question i won't answer""—and went on to talk about how republicans should do better at having a ""clear and compelling message,"" especially when talking to nontraditional gop voters, like minorities and young people. he even suggested that republicans have ""to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election."" that's pretty bold—if not daring—talk for a potential candidate. jeb bush, for example, got hammered in the conservative media for making a similar suggestion back in december. romney appeared to sound more like he was angling to become a kingmaker than a candidate. he continually referred to a need for ""strong leaders"" and ""leadership"" but didn't narrow down his remarks to talk rhetorically about a single leader. his policy ideas were vague it was on that very topic—minority outreach—that political observers were most closely trying to examine romney's recent statements and comments. he won only 6% of the african american vote and 27% of the hispanic vote in 2012. speaking to the republican national committee earlier this month, romney suggested the party needed to focus more on anti-poverty policies, and in his speech on wednesday he laid out some of his ideas for tackling the issue. but his ideas were vague and lacked the kind of depth that would churn more interest in a potential campaign. he argued that the government, for example, was providing incentives for single mothers to stay on federal assistance and avoid marriage because they could lose their benefits once they became married. ""if marriage ... is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty, then we want to do the opposite,"" he said. ""we want to create incentives for them to get married, not to not get married."" he also said k-12 education needs to improve, and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who haven't worked before, but didn't outline specifics. those come nowhere near close to some of the more serious proposals by his former running mate, rep. paul ryan, or by gov. chris christie and sen. rand paul -- who have made efforts to address poverty through criminal justice reform. mystery and pulled pork romney was noticeably more relaxed, not only in his speech, but at a barbecue joint he stopped at earlier in the day to meet with voters. he joked with the national reporters following him in the cramped space that there's an ""unwritten rule"" that politicians shouldn't be photographed while eating. but he continued to eat anyway. ""do you still consider yourself a politician, then?"" one reporter asked, to which romney replied: ""you're taking my picture. what can i say?"" another asked if this is ""the new romney,"" noting that he appeared not to care that he was eating before the cameras. ""i didn't know i had a choice,"" he shot back, drawing some laughs. a conversation romney had with mississippi state football coach dan mullen at the table also seemed to provide a window into perhaps some bitter feelings romney still has about coverage from 2012. in politics, romney argued, there's too much emphasis on what a person says, rather than what a person does. ""it'd be nice if people who run for office, that their leadership experience and what they've accomplished in life would be a bigger part of what people focus on, but it's not,"" he said. ""it's mostly what you say."" what you do, romney told mullen, ""is a lot more important that what you say,"" noting how a football coach's reputation is almost entirely based on his record. ""you could be the sweetest talking person in the world, but unless you got a record, you're in trouble,"" he said. still, he was doing a meet-and-greet—in his jeans and a plaid shirt like he used to—and anyone watching him could have walked away thinking this was a ""go."" the mystery of his barbecue outing--the will he or won't he--was perfectly captured in a response romney gave to one man who urged him to run again. ""you're very kind,"" romney replied, patting the man on the arm. ""i wish i were there right now, i gotta tell ya."" cnn's steve brusk contributed to this report.",mitt romney announced friday he won't run for president again -- a decision he made a week ago

"-- a british court sentenced a saudi prince wednesday to the maximum penalty of life in prison for murdering his servant. prince saud abdulaziz bin nasser al saud will have to serve a minimum of 20 years, a court official said. for now, it will be in a british jail, since britain and saudi arabia do not have a prisoner transfer agreement. the prince was found guilty tuesday of both murder and grievous bodily harm in the february killing of bandar abdulaziz in a case prosecutors said had a sexual element. abdulaziz died after a severe beating left him with swelling and bruising of the brain and fractured ribs and neck. he also had bite marks on his face, ears and arm. the prince had not denied killing abdulaziz, but said he had not intended to do so. he did not take the stand in his own defense. because the prince did not deny killing abdulaziz, the jury's job was to determine if he was guilty of murder or manslaughter. to do that, jurors had to determine the prince's state of mind and his intent at the time he killed abdulaziz. they took just over an hour and a half to reach a verdict. police said after tuesday's verdict that the prince had shown no remorse when he was questioned about his servant's death, instead ""concocting a story"" about how he died. ""when that was found to be a pack of lies, he tried to claim diplomatic immunity,"" but did not qualify for it, john mcfarlane of london's metropolitan police told journalists outside the court tuesday. prosecutors said the prince's systematic mistreatment of the victim had a sexual element. the bites suffered by abdulaziz were not a factor in his death, but had ""an obvious sexual connotation,"" prosecutor jonathan laidlaw said in his opening statement two weeks ago. the two men were in london earlier this year as al saud took in morocco, the maldives and other european cities on a long global holiday with abdulaziz as his companion. al saud's lawyer, john kelsey-fry, said in his closing argument monday that al saud ""must live with the consequences"" of having killed abdulaziz, but he never intended to harm him. he also disputed suggestions from the prosecutor and several witnesses that the prince and his aide had a gay relationship. during their visit to london, the two men shared a hotel room, went shopping together and stayed out late in bars and nightclubs. cnn's richard greene contributed to this report.","new: saudi prince will have to serve at least 20 years, official says"

""they were actually domesticated before the cat,"" jasper said. owning a ferret is legal in 48 states, including in the remainder of new york state, she added. jasper said that as part of her petition, she recommended mandatory rabies vaccinations for the animals, spaying and neutering, leash laws, as well as micro-chipping requirements so that they can be tracked if anyone gets rid of them. the city's ban on ferrets dates back to june 1999 under then-mayor rudy giuliani. the health department said in its announcement that it would be irresponsible from a public safety perspective to allow a ferret to be kept as a pet in new york city, citing their unpredictable behavior and reports that they are prone to attacking humans. that same year, giuliani had a famous dust-up with a ferret lover during his ""live from city hall"" radio show. ""there's something deranged about you,"" giuliani said to caller and ferret advocate david guthartz. ""the excessive concern that you have for ferrets is something you should examine with a therapist."" the humane society calls ferrets ""cute and inquisitive"" and lists them as belonging to a family of animals that includes weasels and minks -- not rodents. and the aspca has them on a list of species suitable as companion animals along with dogs, cats and birds. mayor michael bloomberg upheld his predecessor's ferret ban, but current mayor bill de blasio has not spoken about the issue. but he has already been labeled an animal lover by some after his efforts to remove central park carriage horses from their ""congested, urban setting."" cnn's attempts to reach de blasio wednesday went unanswered. ""i think there are more important things for the mayor to focus on,"" resident shard pierre told cnn. ""there's income distribution problems, rent problems, crime, bigger issues on the agenda than to worry about whether or not people are allowed to own ferrets."" ""i'm an animal lover so if the owner of these ferrets will give them a great life and great experience in this city then i'm all for it,"" resident francisco aliwalas said. ""but there greater things in the city that need to be addressed than little furry elongated creatures scurrying along hardwood floors of apartments."" the health department, led by de blasio appointee dr. mary t. bassett, said that a public hearing and comment period will be held in the fall, followed by a board of health vote. cnn's haimy assefa, chris welch, adam reiss and jason carroll contributed to this report.",a ferret fan petitioned new york's heath department to reconsider ban on animal
"-- on friday night, wired technology journalist mat honan was brutally hacked. in a chain of events that honan would unravel in the following days, hackers took advantage of security holes at amazon and apple to gain access to his icloud account. they then took over his gmail account, remotely wiped all data from his macbook air, iphone and ipad, and took over his twitter account as well as the twitter account of his former employer, gizmodo. the incident might seem small on its surface -- just one person's information, not a huge data breach of credit card numbers. but this one very public incident, thoroughly documented by honan in a wired article, could be a wake-up call to many who store their information with cloud-based services, including amazon, apple and google. ""my experience leads me to believe that cloud-based systems need fundamentally different security measures,"" said honan. ""password-based security mechanisms â€” which can be cracked, reset and socially engineered â€” no longer suffice in the era of cloud computing."" the hackers used fairly basic techniques to accomplish the hack. they found honan's home address and e-mail address online, and after some back and forth with amazon tech support, used it to get the last four digits of honan's credit card number. they called apple customer support pretending to be honan and used those four numbers along with same billing address to verify his identity, gaining access to honan's icloud account and the associated .me account. the .me account was honan's backup e-mail for his gmail account. once they were in his gmail, the hackers could reset passwords for all the key accounts that used gmail, including twitter accounts. once in, the hacker spammed honan's twitter followers and deleted all the data from his various devices. the remote wipe option is a security service offered by apple as part of its find my mac/iphone/ipad feature. if devices associated with the apple id are stolen, the owner can execute a remote wipe to prevent their data from falling into the wrong hands. the motivation for the crime seems to be rather banal. in conversations with honan, one of the hackers responsible revealed he just wanted honan's three-letter twitter handle, @mat. ""i honestly didn't have any heat towards you before this. i just liked your username like i said before,"" he wrote honan. remotely wiping honan's computers and mobile devices, permanently erasing data including a year-and-a-half of photos of his young daughter, was also done without any real reason. ""yea i really am a nice guy idk why i do some of the things i do,"" the hacker wrote. apple responded with an official statement on monday night, saying, ""apple takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an apple id password. in this particular case, the customer's data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer. in addition, we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely. we are reviewing all of our processes for resetting account passwords to ensure our customers' data is protected."" however, while investigating the breach over the weekend, honan said he confirmed twice with apple tech support that only two pieces of information are required to get access to an icloud account: a billing address and the last four digits of the credit card associated with the account. wired reporters say they tested the hacker's approach by successfully trying it on another account themselves. amazon has not yet commented on the report.",hackers use possible amazon and apple security holes to delete tech writer's data
"-- whew. after 48 days of living with helicopters, heavily armed police officers, the rumors and constant questions -- where is he? -- the people of northeast pennsylvania can finally relax. the manhunt for eric matthew frein, accused of killing a pennsylvania state trooper, is over. heavily armed u.s. marshals captured frein on thursday night and turned him over to state police, who slapped the slain officer's cuffs on him, put him in the back of the trooper's squad car and sent him back to the barracks where the ambush occurred. ""we just thought it was fitting,"" state police commissioner frank noonan said. frein, 31, is charged with first-degree murder and other charges in a september 12 ambush outside the state police barracks in blooming grove. he's accused of killing cpl. bryon dickson and wounding trooper alex t. douglass before melting into the thick pennsylvania woods. authorities had worried the survivalist and military buff with a reported history of cop hatred might go out in a violent standoff. in the end, he gave up without a fight. his capture ended a lengthy search that burned through some $10 million, according to the county prosecutor, and likely as many nerves. ""it actually felt like i was in a war zone a couple of weeks ago, and it was hard to sleep for a few nights, worrying about where he is,"" resident mark denny told cnn affiliate wnep-tv. the capture the squad of 13 u.s. marshals -- armed like a military special operations squad -- found frein at an abandoned airport near tannersville, authorities said. frein hadn't been spotted. he was discovered as part of a ""routine sweep through the woods,"" state police lt. col. george bivens told reporters. and he wasn't armed at the time of his capture, according to police, much to the relief of authorities who feared a violent showdown. when marshals surprised him in a field near the airport, he obeyed their orders to get down on his hands and knees and told them who he was, noonan said. there was no struggle, pike county district attorney raymond tonkin said. investigators searching the area did find a cache that included a sniper rifle, noonan said. the rifle appears to be consistent with casings gathered during the investigation, he said. frein was in good physical condition when he was captured, apart from a cut on his nose that he had before the marshals found him, according to noonan. he looked ""healthier than i would have expected,"" noonan said. ""he's been stashing food, he's been staying out in the woods,"" noonan said. ""he had a lot of locations he knew how to hide in. and also, he had been preparing himself by participating in these re-enactments, especially in the vietnam era, where he specifically trained himself and trained with other people to hide in the woods and avoid detection."" officials said they were unsure how long he had been hiding at the airport. opinion: were cops out of line in trooper-killing arrest? court appearance during his court appearance friday frein looked thin, with the cut on his nose and abrasions on his forehead. his left cheek was swollen. his voice was strong as he answered, ""yes i do,"" to a pike county judge's question if he understood the charges against him, which include first-degree murder and criminal homicide of a law enforcement officer. about 30 police were in the room for the 10-minute hearing. tonkin, the district attorney, said he plans to seek the death penalty. frein is being held in the pike county correctional institute in lords valley. in an interview with cnn on friday, gov. tom corbett said he expects authorities to make sure frein stays safe. ""i'm sure they will have all precautions taken, not only for his well-being from other inmates but from himself, too,"" corbett said. motive unclear tonkin declined to say what, if anything, frein has revealed about the attack that left dickson dead and douglass critically wounded. douglass has since been released and is continuing to recover, according to police. after his arrest, frein made statements implicating himself in the shootings, according to a law enforcement official who was briefed on the capture. authorities also found his diary, but contents of that document haven't been revealed. authorities have not discussed a motive but have said frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement. ""i've characterized his actions in the past as pure evil, and i would stand by that,"" tonkin said friday. a review of his computer hard drive shows he had planned an attack for years, authorities said. according to the criminal complaint against him, frein searched the internet going back to 2012 for information related on placing supply caches, police manhunt techniques and how to evade them and other topics. ""eric frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement,"" noonan said. ""if he got out of those woods, we were very concerned that he would then kill other law enforcement. and if not them, civilians. that's why we had to keep the pressure on."" there was no indication that anyone was helping frein, who was ""quite well-prepared,"" noonan said. 'a celebration' frein's arrest punctured the thick tension that had blanketed the region for weeks. ""it's been a long seven weeks,"" corbett said on cnn's ""new day."" during the search, some outdoor activities were curtailed and some schoolchildren didn't go out for recess. ""it's just exciting and we're happy. we didn't go out of school for weeks for recess,"" resident shannon juirad told wnep. and then there was the question of halloween. at least one community, barrett township, canceled trick-or-treating as the search dragged on, instead suggesting children show up at a school parking lot to collect candy under the supervision of local and state police. but with frein in custody, the trick-or-treating will go on as normal, said barrett township board chairman ralph megliola. ""i'm ecstatic -- and just in time for halloween!"" megliola said. pennsylvania game commission executive director r. matthew hough lifted the temporary prohibition on hunting and trapping activity in all areas that had been affected by the manhunt. outside the police barracks, residents held a sign reading, ""way to go psp."" passing motorists slowed, also offering words of encouragement for the pennsylvania state police. ""we all have children and we were afraid to go outside, we were afraid to do anything,"" one woman told cnn affiliate wbre-tv. ""i can't even explain what i'm feeling right now, this is awesome. we are so proud of our pennsylvania state police, their hard work,"" another said. ""now it's a celebration,"" one woman wearing a ""barrett proud"" shirt told wnep. cnn's miguel marquez reported from milford, pennsylvania, and cnn's michael pearson reported and wrote from atlanta. cnn's jethro mullen, dana ford, anneclaire stapleton, joe sutton, pamela brown, rob frehse, susan candiotti, shimon prokupecz, faith karimi and evan perez contributed to this report.","eric frein implicated himself in shootings after arrest, law enforcement source says"
"-- in 1989, the warnings were dire. the spike lee film ""do the right thing,"" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. spike lee: ""i wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" ""this movie is dynamite under every seat,"" wrote newsweek's jack kroll. other commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of david dinkins, an african-american who was running for mayor of new york. it might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. instead, what the film provoked was ... talk. there were no riots. dinkins was elected. ""do the right thing"" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two academy awards. twenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. in 2007, the american film institute ranked it as one of the 100 best american films. roger ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the cannes film festival, still considers the film a wonder: ""spike lee had done an almost impossible thing. he'd made a movie about race in america that empathized with all the participants,"" he wrote in 2001. so what is the thing about ""do the right thing?"" watch spike lee describe things in his own words » part of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. lee's first two films, ""she's gotta have it"" (1986) and ""school daze"" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. but it was ""do the right thing,"" made when lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax. then there was its willingness to address issues head-on. lee has said he wrote the film quickly, upset by racial incidents roiling new york city in the 1980s. (in one, the 1986 howard beach tragedy, three black men who had wandered into the largely italian neighborhood by mistake were beaten by a group of white teens; one of the men was killed as he fled across a nearby highway.) ""when i wrote the script ... new york city was a very polarized city, racially,"" he said. ""i wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" he was also determined to roll in other clashes between poor locals and gentrifying whites, between police and citizenry, even between men and women. that friction takes a simple, sketchy plot -- a scorching day in the life of brooklyn's bedford-stuyvesant neighborhood -- and turns it into a series of tense standoffs. the generally african-american residents are trying to beat the heat. sal, an italian pizza shop owner, oversees his corner business. a local agitator, buggin out, crosses sal. sal's prejudiced son pino faces off with mookie, the delivery man played by lee. the residents grumble at the korean grocer. but all is more or less calm until sal busts the boombox of the defiant radio raheem, and then hell breaks loose. the passion of ""do the right thing"" is obvious: ""opinion will always be divided on ... 'do the right thing,' "" wrote the new yorker's anthony lane. ""but it remains a thrilling panorama of social crackup -- a wide and worthy development of themes that lee had been mulling since 'she's gotta have it.' "" the film also boasts indelible performances -- lee, danny aiello as sal, giancarlo esposito as buggin out, ossie davis and ruby dee as da mayor and mother sister, john turturro as pino -- and memorable music, a mix of jazz penned by lee's father, bill, and the public enemy song ""fight the power."" but perhaps the real reason people talk about ""do the right thing"" two decades on is because it's still relevant. lee makes the point that race issues haven't vanished simply because america has a black president. ""it's not like this thing has disappeared because {president obama} is in the white house,"" he said. some things have improved, particularly the atmosphere in new york itself, he said. but, ""we've got a lot of work to do."" ironically, some of that work has to be done at hollywood studios. though lee is quick to credit universal and its then head tom pollock for championing the film, he said things haven't changed much in the movie business. ""sports is so much more advanced than hollywood,"" he said. ""i can go for a meeting at a studio [and] the only black person i'm going to see is the brother-man at the gate letting me in.""","""do the right thing"" came out 20 years ago this summer"
"-- two years after the terror attack on the u.s. diplomatic compound in benghazi, libya, many republicans still have unanswered questions about security issues related to the incident. many democrats say that after dozens of hearings, briefings, probes and reports on the subject, this latest committee could amount to nothing more than a fishing expedition. one thing both parties agreed on at wednesday's first hearing of the latest inquiry - the new house benghazi select committee- was that substantial security improvements by the state department and an eye to the lessons of the past are necessary to prevent future american deaths. the september 11, 2012, attack left u.s. ambassador christopher stevens, sean smith, glen doherty and tyrone woods dead, and immediately sparked controversy, with republicans accusing the obama administration of mishandling the attack and manipulating the talking points used to discuss it for political reasons. numerous investigations into the attack have been championed on the right by media organizations and by republicans, including former presidential candidate mitt romney and house oversight and government reform committee chairman darrell issa. the goal of this latest committee -- the house benghazi select committee -- is to ""produce the final, definitive accounting on behalf of congress of what happened before, during and after the terrorist attacks on our facilities in benghazi,"" according to committee communications director jamal d. ware. wednesday's hearing, titled ""implementation of the accountability review board (arb) recommendations"" -- a topic the committee spokesman said was selected by democrats -- was aimed at examining the steps being taken to implement a series of proposals to make sure high threat diplomatic posts get the security they need. gregory starr, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, mark j. sullivan, former director of the united states secret service and todd keil, former assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at the department of homeland security testified before the committee. related: clinton supporters launch counter-attack on benghazi claims ""now is the time to clear the smoke, remove the mirrors. now is the time for the department of state to finally institutionalize some real, meaningful and progressive change,"" keil, also a member of the arb's independent panel on best practices, said in his opening remarks. ""they can't lose this moment. words and cursory actions by the department of state ring hollow absent transparency and verifiable and sustainable actions."" past recommendations ignored? keil, select committee chairman rep. trey gowdy (r-sc) and other members said too often the recommendations made after a security failure have been ignored. gowdy cited proposals presented after the beirut embassy bombing in 1983 and the 1998 bombings of the u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania. ""it is stunning to see the similarities between the recommendations made decades ago and the recommendations made by the benghazi arb and, if you doubt that, i want you to compare the recommendations of those made 25, a quarter of a century ago, 25 years ago, with the recommendations made by the benghazi arb,"" gowdy said. ""we do not suffer from a lack of recommendations. we do suffer from a lack of implementing and enacting those recommendations and that has to end."" maryland rep. elijah cummings, the ranking democrat on the committee who has accused republicans of politicizing the benghazi attack, said his goal was to focus on reform efforts and to learn from past tragedies. cummings called the attack a ""transformational moment"" -- a comment later echoed by keil and republican members. related: war against isis - what does rand paul's 'yes' mean? one high-energy exchange between ohio republican jim jordan and keil focused one of the best practices panel's 40 recommendations that the state department create a new post -- undersecretary for diplomatic security, to help make sure one designated official would be accountable for security. keil said that was the panel's top recommendation. ""in our executive summary we said one clear and overarching recommendation is crucial to the successful and sustainable implementation of all the recommendations in this report is the creation of an undersecretary,"" keil said. state has declined to implement that recommendation, even though it is similar to one made after the east africa embassy bombings, keil said. jordan slammed the agency's track record. ""what's it going to take for the state department to put in place the practices that will save american lives?"" he asked. ""they didn't follow their own standards that were developed in 1983 after the beirut embassy bombing. they didn't follow the waiver policy to deviate from those standards and now they're not following the best practices panel's number 1 recommendation. what's it going to take?"" starr said the department looked at the recommendation very seriously and decided what was most important was that he had direct access to the secretary. ""i am directly reportable to the secretary for security threat information and security threats against our people,"" he said. starr said a good deal of progress had been made in implementing other recommendations to mitigate the risk to us personnel in dangerous places. ""like you, we want to keep our people safe,"" said starr in his opening testimony, but he also warned that ""while we can do everything we can to reduce the risk, we can never eliminate it fully."" sullivan, who was also chairman of the independent panel on best practices, said better communication, planning and logistics and risk management might have helped prevent the deaths in benghazi and said improvements were being made in each of those areas. starr and keil raised questions about whether u.s. personnel even need to be stationed in dangerous places and said there must be a risk-management process in place to answer that key question in each instance. ""we need to ask the question, why are we in the most dangerous places?"" starr said. ""and the 30 places that we identified as the highest threat, highest risk, that's exactly what we're doing, going through every single one of those 30 and doing this vital presence validation process. the first step is, what is our national interest for being there?""",a new benghazi select committee got under way on capitol hill
"-- at least five people were killed in oklahoma on monday after a severe storm system spawned multiple tornadoes across the state, the state emergency management department said. three people died in cleveland county, just west of tecumseh, oklahoma, said albert ashwood, director of the state emergency management department, and another was reported dead near choctaw, east of oklahoma city, oklahoma. the location in oklahoma of the fifth person who died was unknown late monday night. brenda finkle, director of corporate communications for norman regional health system, said the company's hospital in norman admitted eight patients monday night in critical condition with crush injuries and head trauma. at least 25 other people filled the waiting room of norman regional hospital with lacerations and head wounds, finkle said, adding hospital staff expected more patients to continue to seek treatment. another 20 people were either getting medical care or awaiting treatment at moore medical center, just north of norman, according to finkle. ou medical center in oklahoma city, oklahoma, received two patients with broken bones, according to spokesman allen poston. the oklahoma department of emergency management reported seven injuries. video out of norman showed overturned cars, snapped utility poles, downed trees and severely damaged homes. several mobile homes were blown to pieces in one neighborhood where debris littered yards and streets alongside large trees ripped straight from the ground. a truck stop east of oklahoma city was demolished, taking a direct hit from one of the tornadoes, according to a spokeswoman for love's travel stops and country stores. motorists pulled off interstate 40 and sought shelter in the truck stop's large coolers and restrooms before the tornado tore the roof off the building, blew out car windows and overturned tractor-trailers, spokeswoman christina dukeman said. video showed people outside the truck stop receiving treatment for minor injuries. laura o'leary, a spokeswoman for the emergency medical services authority, said seven people were transported from around the immediate area to local hospitals in good and fair condition, ""a miraculously low number ... considering the volume of area the tornado covered."" love's employee charlescie greenway said she and two other women made it to one cooler before the twister tore through the building. ""the three of us were kind of trapped in there, holding the door shut, praying to god that we don't die and that everybody else was safe,"" greenway told cnn affiliate kwtv, adding, ""it was really scary -- the wind was like trying to pull the door off the latch."" sammy ward and his partner rode the twister out in their truck in the parking lot. ""it started hailing and then it quit hailing and then all of a sudden the wind hit and it just went dark and here went everything,"" ward told kwtv. ""trucks went to rocking ... and next thing we know the whole roof and everything was gone."" ward, who said he felt ""very lucky,"" said the event lasted two to three minutes. ashwood said crews were working to assess the damages in at least 13 counties, adding ""numerous"" homes had been affected. are you there? send photos, video the american red cross opened at least two shelters in mccloud, oklahoma, and tecumseh, oklahoma, and continued to assess needs across the state. more than 31,000 homes were without power in the metro oklahoma city area -- nearly 15,000 in norman alone, according to oklahoma gas & electric. ashwood said preliminary reports out of norman indicate the damages are ""similar to what you would see with an ef3"" tornado, referring to the enhanced fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes. an ef3 is capable of producing winds up to 165 mph. cnn ireporter rebecca barbato said tornado sirens were going off in her neighborhood in moore, just north of norman, when tennis-ball-sized hail began raining down on her roof. other tornadoes were reported in yukon, medford and shawnee in oklahoma, and in wichita, kansas. the storms struck around 5 p.m. ct (6 p.m. et). meteorologists warned throughout the day monday of the potential for tornadoes. cnn's devon sayers and sarah aarthun contributed to this report.",new: at least five killed in oklahoma
"-- when president obama unveiled his revamped national security team in the east room, he quickly joked about how badly defense secretary robert gates has been itching to finally get serious about retirement. ""when i took office, bob gates had already served under seven presidents, and he carried a clock that counted down the days, hours, and minutes until he could return to washington state with his wife, becky,"" obama said. he added that he felt lucky to get gates to keep pushing the exit date back to deal with wars in afghanistan and iraq as well as some major budget decisions confronting the nation. first it was obama during the presidential transition in december 2008 getting gates to stay on for just one more year for continuity's sake. then that grew to staying on for first 2½ years of the administration. senior officials tell me that obama had even been hoping to somehow persuade gates to stay on through all four years of the first term for the good of the country, but the president finally gave in and then set his sights to twisting the reluctant arm of cia director leon panetta to delay his own retirement to take the top spot at the pentagon. obama shuffles familiar faces in key security roles as obama noted to laughter about his lobbying of gates, ""at some point along the way, bob threw out that clock."" it was an apt metaphor, because top defense analysts say the clock is ticking on the obama administration as its first -- and possibly only -- term in office winds down. ""the timing right now is really critical in terms of how the resources will get sorted out,"" said david berteau, head of the defense industrial practice at the center for strategic and international studies. berteau is referring to the fact that panetta and the rest of the new team will have just 18 months to deal with the arduous task of somehow squeezing hundreds of billions of dollars out of the planned pentagon budget for the next decade or so -- it's pretty much impossible to find a way to get the numbers in obama's deficit-cutting plan to add up without significant defense savings. and they have to do this while winding down two very expensive wars in afghanistan and iraq, trying to help finish the mission in libya, preparing for possible conflicts anywhere from syria to north korea, all the while trying to figure out how things will settle down in the mideast. no wonder panetta had to have his arm twisted to take this job, and he even joked to the crowd that the departing gates was easy to spot at the event because he was the ""guy with the big smile next to me"" on the platform. panetta immediately noted the mind-numbing change the world has witnessed in recent months. ""as the son of immigrants, i was raised to believe that we cannot be free unless we are secure,"" he said. ""today we are a nation at war. and job one will be to ensure that we are the strongest military power in the world to protect that security that is so important to this country."" panetta's other big task will be trying to deal with the competing goals of protecting america's military superiority and drastically reducing the pentagon's $550 billion annual budget. the former white house chief of staff and budget director in the clinton administration said he is committed to finding that balance. new men, new missions at pentagon and cia he called it ""a time for hard choices."" ""it's about ensuring that we are able to prevail in the conflicts in which we are now engaged,"" panetta said. ""but it's also about being able to be strong and disciplined in applying our nation's limited resources to defending america."" panetta emphasized that ""none of this will be easy,"" and administration officials say privately this is a major reason why the president was so heavily focused on picking experienced old hands to round out the new(ish) national security team, with gen. david petraeus nominated to replace panetta at the cia. while some critics have dismissed the changes as a game of musical chairs, it's worth noting the people filling those chairs are heavily respected on both sides of the aisle. when was the last time you heard a republican touting the ""honesty and integrity"" of an obama nominee as house intelligence chairman mike rogers, r-michigan, did? ""while i'm sorry to see mr. panetta go (from the cia), his talent and leadership will be put to great use leading the defense department,"" rogers said. ""mr. gates is leaving huge shoes to fill at the pentagon, and i can't imagine a better candidate to replace him."" there has also been praise for the selections from republicans like sen. lindsey graham of south carolina, a senior member of the armed services committee who will vote on the nominations of panetta and lt. gen. john allen, who has been nominated to replace petraeus as the allied commander of the war in afghanistan. obama also nominated the highly respected ryan crocker to serve as the new u.s. ambassador in afghanistan ahead of the july deadline that is fast approaching, which the president has held up as a pivot point for starting to bring home u.s. troops. besides being experienced, many of these players know each other very well. when the war in iraq was falling apart, it was then-president george w. bush's decision to install petraeus as the commander on the ground and crocker as the u.s. ambassador in baghdad -- with allen serving under petraeus on the military side -- that was one of the pivotal moments that got the mission back on track. ""i mean petraeus and crocker were the 'dream team' in iraq,"" berteau said. ""these guys have all worked together."" that is significant because an administration can sometimes waste months and months getting key players to gel. ""it provides the opportunity to get things done because you don't have to waste your time in transition,"" said berteau. the time needs to be used wisely to tackle all of the challenges the team will face in the next year and a half, including nothing short of the most momentous transformation of the american military in a couple of decades. bennett: why panetta, petraeus are smart choices ""we are about to embark on the next big defense drawdown,"" berteau said. ""panetta is uniquely qualified because he was at the white house during the last big drawdown in the early 1990s."" indeed, panetta served as white house chief of staff and the budget director during the clinton administration and helped balance the federal budget. he was able then to benefit from his previous tenure as chairman of the house budget committee, and he will be able to draw upon that deep reservoir of respect again now.

"-- he's won six medals in the winter olympics, including a gold in 2008, and a bronze just a few months ago in sochi. bode miller's methods, however, have never been orthodox. ""i never really worked very goal-oriented,"" he admits. ""i think i've had some great results and i've had a long career, so, i mean, i'm happy about that. but i didn't really ever have goals, the way that most people did."" miller has always intrigued media and fans alike. an unconventional upbringing in a new hampshire log cabin with no electricity or running water gave way to a skiing career in which, for miller, his natural talent and love of the sport always won out over, well, winning. indeed, his goal, as stated in his book ""bode: go fast, be good, have fun"" was to ski ""as fast as the natural universe would allow."" back home after an emotional olympics in sochi, where miller cried during a live interview with nbc's christin cooper when asked about the recent death of his brother, miller is focusing on another project: his turtle ridge foundation. miller began the foundation after close friend cameron shaw-doran suffered a traumatic injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down. ""i was trying to help him get re-involved in sports. he was a great athlete before his injury and was really having a hard time sort of adapting, which is a really tough process when you're injured like that,"" says miller. ""just to watch him go through that i saw how hard it was and how little support there was for him."" the experience motivated miller to find ways to help get disabled and injured athletes more involved in sports. ""we provide the sporting equipment for them and the environment that allows them to participate in whatever sport that is,"" miller explains. shaw-doran serves as director of equipment development for turtle ridge, and miller has called on friends and associates from across the sporting world to create and adapt equipment to help adaptive skiers and adaptive athletes in other sports. a major annual event for turtle ridge is bodefest, an all-day ski and barbecue extravaganza on miller's home turf of cannon mountain, new hampshire, complete with autographs, an auction and a chance for children to race their idol. watching miller hurtle down the mountain, swarmed by a speeding army of tiny ""bodephiles,"" it's a wonder and a testament to his skills that the whole thing doesn't end in a giant human snowball. ""all the kids want to try and get on the lift with me for at least one run and there's 400 kids or so. it turns into a bit of pandemonium on the way down,"" miller says. not only is bodefest a fundraiser, but it's also an opportunity for adaptive athletes to try some of the new equipment on the late-season snow. ""the program's really just changed my life,"" says adaptive skier owen anketell, who has a condition that affects the muscles in his lower legs. ""i never thought that i'd be able to ski even though i'm in a wheelchair -- or bike -- but this program's really changed my opinion on adaptive sports."" ""the key is empowering,"" says miller. ""when we build some of our ski equipment and you give it to a kid who never had the chance to go up and experience what it is to ski down a giant mountain and you watch how life-changing that can be for them, i think it's really -- it's pretty incredible."" the sentiment seems to fit with miller's general philosophy of focusing on how the sport makes you feel, rather than the end game, a feeling he believes everyone is entitled to, regardless of ability. it may not be competition, but it is a goal he can take into retirement -- and still win.",bode miller started the turtle ridge foundation after a close friend was paralyzed

""we are concerned about both the levels of 4-mei we found in many of the soft drinks tested and the variations observed among brands, especially given the widespread consumption of these types of beverages,"" said dr. urvashi rangan, a consumer reports toxicologist, in a statement. ""there is no reason why consumers need to be exposed to this avoidable and unnecessary risk that can stem from coloring food and beverages brown."" the food and drug administration does not set federal limits on 4-mei in food, and the data gathered by consumer reports show that in some cases consumers outside california are drinking a slightly different ingredient. for example, pepsi one purchased by the group in december in new york contains four times as much 4-mei as the same product bought that same month in california. what is clean eating? currently the fda has no reason to believe that 4-mel poses a health risk to consumers at the levels found in foods with caramel coloring, agency spokeswoman juli putnam told cnn in an e-mail. the government agency is testing a variety of food and beverages with the chemical and reviewing safety data to determine if any regulatory action needs to be taken, she said. consumers interested in more information on 4-mel can check out the fda's faq page. in a statement to consumer reports, pepsico inc. said data indicate that the average person consumes less than one-third a can of diet soda per day; therefore, its product meets the california standard, even if a complete serving exceeds that limit. in addition to new federal standards, consumer reports is calling on the fda to ""require labeling of specific caramel colors in the ingredient lists of food where it is added, so consumers can make informed choices.""

""if you see how confined this space is, and you realize the chaos that existed on this street, i think it's understandable. it's not that surprising,"" kelly said. ""it's very, very confined, and no construction work went on, or no clean up went on in this 18-inch space between the two buildings"" after the attacks. some family members of 9/11 victims are outraged by the discovery. sally regenhard, whose son christian, a probationary firefighter, died when the towers collapsed, said: ""i'm disgusted, because after 9/11, the proper search was never done. the whole aftermath was uncoordinated. it was inadequate."" regenhard has been one of the leading voices and, at times, critics for the families of the 9/11 victims, pushing hard for a federal investigation and calling for a more comprehensive search for remains and debris.

"once was a time when getting money out for the weekend meant going down to the bank branch and joining a long queue. since then atms, credit cards and internet banking have taken the place of the payday press at the grille of a bank teller. with all the facilities of a bank now fitting into a palm-sized smartphone, the drudgery of waiting to deposit or withdraw funds has been consigned to the waste paper basket of history. just a swipe of the finger can now transfer funds between accounts anywhere in the world and even taking a picture can deposit a cheque. increasingly high street branches -- many of them still occupying some of the most imposing buildings in town -- are becoming expensive white elephants for many banking corporations. one bank, however, is repurposing its more than 300 banks to bring people back to the branch; making its physical space as enticing as the virtual one. ""the branch model is outdated and not relevant any longer we're looking to create a different kind of bank one that offers all the products and services of a large bank but delivers them with real community engagement and the service of a great retailer or hospitality company,"" said eve callahan of oregon-based umpqua bank. using what it calls the store concept, umpqua bank aims to create for banking what apple or gap has done for computing and apparel -- that is set up a space where customers, or just the curious, can browse, rest or come in and do some banking. umpqua's store in san francisco is the latest manifestation of the project. the slick, modern and comfortable space provides information on a touchscreen (what it calls a catalyst wall) rather than on the traditional brochures. customers that want a meeting room can use one of umpqua's at no cost. even if all you want is a cup of coffee and some free wifi, then umpqua's doors are always open. ultimately, banking is based on trust and umpqua has found its local branches a perfect place to build that relationship. ""there's no pressure that you're not a customer with us. we welcome everyone regardless of whether they have a relationship with us or not,"" said abdul sanger, universal associate, at umpqua bank. the model is now being emulated by large banks such as chase, citibank and barclays, all anxious to rebuild the face-to-face relationships that have been lost in the internet age.

"at munich zoo you can watch the courtship rituals of the banded mongoose, hear the morning song of the scarlet ibis or visit the indian elephants, who help keep the lights on with electricity generated from their dung. they can do this because munich zoo has harnessed ""poo power,"" energy stored in animal waste, which can be converted into a fuel known as ""biogas."" it works like this: the zoo has built three large containers, each capable of holding about 100 cubic meters of animal waste -- that's around a week's worth of dung collected from all the vegetarian animals in the zoo. once inside the containers, it's mixed with warm water and the bacteria in the dung is left to decompose in an oxygen-free environment for 30 days. the resulting biogas, mainly comprised of methane and carbon dioxide, rises naturally through vents in the ceiling to a corrugated hut on the roof where it's collected in a ""big balloon,"" says park supervisor dominik forster. the biogas is then fed into a gas-powered engine that's used to generate electricity. forster says that the balloon -- which more closely resembles a small zeppelin -- can store enough biogas to meet 5% of the zoo's energy needs. ""when you turn the biogas into electricity, it creates heat which we also store,"" says forster. this is then used to warm the gorilla enclosure, ""but could be used to heat about 25 homes,"" he adds. once the fermentation process that creates the methane is finished, the remaining solid matter, or ""digestate"" is used as an organic fertilizer for crops that will later be used as feedstock for the animals. ""we don't waste anything,"" said forster, who claims that his is the only zoo in germany to generate electricity in this way. a mature elephant can eat about 100 kilograms of fruit, vegetables and pretzels a day, producing a mountain of dung and forster says that all the zoo animals together create roughly 2,000 tons of the stuff every year. this is enough to power about 100 munich households -- a drop in the ocean when you consider munich's population, which is 1.3 million, according to cia world factbook. the problem is that dung alone does not produce all that much energy relative to its size, says geraint evans, head of biofuels at the uk's national centre for biorenewable energy, fuels and materials. ""by the time the food has been digested by the animal, a lot of the energy in it has been used up or burped out,"" he said. ""it's more efficient to just put the feed directly into the biogas generator."" even if the returns are small at this stage, evans says this project and others similar are still worth it. ""it's really important that we change our mindset from dependence on one source of energy to many different complementary sources,"" evans said. ""animal waste can create electricity, heat, fertilizer ... even clean water can be extracted from the solids to spray on crops ... so, it's emblematic of this very holistic approach."" in this spirit, forster says there are now plans to install photo-voltaic solar panels on top of the animal enclosures over the coming year.",zoo in germany partially powered by electricity produced from animal dung

"-- a food and drug administration advisory committee said wednesday that the agency should look at updated data on mercury amalgam dental fillings that may indicate possible medical problems for patients. the panel -- after hearing two days of testimony from experts, members of the public and dental professionals -- recommended the fda look at information updated since the agency ruled in 2009 that the mercury in dental fillings is not harmful. committee members noted, however, that the fda's decision was solid, based on information available at the time. the committee also stressed that more studies need to be done on amalgam fillings, especially in children. public pressure prompted the panel's review, initiated less than 18 months after the agency's decision. committee members listened to testimony by consumer and dental groups claiming the fda used flawed science when it set the current guidelines for mercury safety levels. ""we need to see where the science is and if there are gaps."" said the panel's chairwoman, dr. marjorie jeffcoat, a dentist and researcher with the university of pennsylvania. in its final rule, the fda concluded clinical studies did not establish a causal link between dental amalgam and health problems in people age 6 and older. but it did add that developing fetuses and young children may be more sensitive to the neurotoxin. amalgam tooth fillings are an alloy made up of various metals and 50 percent mercury, mercury toxicity has been well documented, but when it comes to amalgam fillings there isn't a lot of data. many dentists favor these fillings because they are cheap, easy to put in place and durable. dental professionals also argue that mercury fillings last longer than resin composites, and are easier on the tooth. the american dental association agrees with the fda that amalgam fillings are safe. yet, some experts say mercury from these fillings penetrates into the body and damages human cells, especially in the brain, bones and kidneys. how much damage it is unknown, which is why the advisory committee is revisiting the issue. in wednesday's public hearing, 30 people testified for and against the use of amalgam fillings. jessica kerger, an attorney from toledo, ohio, said she was a healthy child until she started getting amalgam fillings. as she got older, she faced numerous health problems and a variety of diagnoses. she even had her amalgam fillings removed. it wasn't until a doctor tested her for mercury poisoning that she realized her problem, she said. now, after being treated for excess mercury in her body, kerger said, ""i'm an active mother, attorney and i have a black belt in karate. i blame my fillings and i am begging the fda to get rid of them."" while others testified that mercury in their fillings caused such health problems as loss of memory, impaired vision, miscarriages and paralysis, many dental professionals asked that amalgam fillings remain. addressing the board, dr. vincent mayher, a former president of the academy of general dentistry, said public accusations that dentists force patients to receive amalgam fillings is exaggerated. ""it's inflammatory. no dentist i know of forces a patient at any time to get amalgam fillings these days, especially pregnant women and little children."" mayher testified andrew read fuller, a dental student at ucla and member of the american student dental association, noted there is no scientific data that amalgam fillings cause the problems some attribute to them, and said that, as a future dentist, he would use amalgam fillings on any of his patients as well as himself. ""in the absence of new evidence there is no reason to question the fda's decision."" fuller said. yet some dentists did say they would avoid using amalgam fillings because of numerous public reports of mercury poisoning. ""i always wondered why we were told by the (american dental association) to be careful when disposing of mercury. if it's so dangerous to the environment, why not my patients?"" asked dr. stephen markus, a dentist in the philadelphia area. the committee also recommended that the fda come up with models that could be used to look at the effects of mercury vapor exposure from dental fillings. and when designing these models, it said, the agency should take into consideration age, health history and physical makeup of individuals. there was also discussion that more data needs to be looked at to come up with stronger models, especially those based on younger children and unborn fetuses. more information on amalgam fillings should be posted for both for patients and dentists, the committee said. it also noted the fda's biomarker using urine to detect mercury exposure is not perfect but is the best available for adults. members also noted that more updated data is needed before the agency can make stronger guidelines on amalgam fillings. although the committee's recommendations will go to the fda board for consideration, the board does not have to follow them. traditionally, however, it does.",advisory panel recommends re-evaluation of mercury in dental fillings

"(ew.com) -- why did sienna miller fall off hollywood's radar shortly after the 2009 release of g.i. joe: the rise of cobra? the answer's simple, according to miller herself: ""i sabotaged things,"" she says. ""i burnt a lot of bridges."" there's more blunt honesty where that came from in miller's big esquire uk interview, the magazine's latest cover story. (and yes, the article also includes a very tasteful, black-and-white topless photoshoot.) in between a fair amount of purple prose (""[we] talked to each other, and at each other, and occasionally over each other about feminism and social media and the press and public morality and twerking, obviously...some of this into my voice recorder, some of it into the wind""), miller gives a lot of insight into her rocky career, which started to slump when her private life became more interesting than her professional life — and miller freely admits that she's got nobody to blame for that but herself. (although according to interviewer alex bilmes, miller does concede ""that she certainly wouldn't have been treated in this way were she a man."" maybe there's a katherine heigl comparison to be made here?) the trouble began when 2004′s alfie remake was released — and 22-year-old miller suddenly skyrocketed to fame, due to her roles as both the film's costar and jude law's girlfriend. ""i was really naive,"" she recalls to bilmes. ""not green as grass — i was by no means an innocent — but i had faith in the goodness of everyone. i was very open. and that led me into all sorts of situations that backfired."" namely, miller never really learned how to play the pr game: ""i was english. i was, 'let's be who we are! i'm not going to have my hair done every morning and yes: i smell of fags!' and so i would walk into studio heads' offices and we'd crack up laughing."" and while she claims that she was always ""totally professional"" on movie sets, offset, the actress ""had no business sense whatsoever"": ""i never read a review or paid any mind to what anyone said,"" miller admits. she also ruffled feathers with her off-the-cuff remarks, as when she memorably called pennsylvania's second-largest city ""sh--sburgh."" and of course, she got caught in one tabloid scandal after another, first due to her tumultuous relationship with law and later when she had an affair with the married actor balthazar getty. as a result, miller says roles dried up — because ""people don't want to see films with people they don't approve of in them."" (you know, unless they're men.) so miller ""deliberately disappeared"" from the spotlight, and from the nasty reputation she'd developed. ""i was sick of myself, to be honest, or sick of that perception of me,"" she says. ""it all felt so f—ing dirty."" since miller's now doing a huge confessional interview in a big glossy magazine, it's safe to say that things are looking up for her. after the disaster that was g.i. joe, she found refuge on the stage and with a well-received turn as tippi hedren in the 2012 tv movie the girl. two years later, miller is staging something of a film comeback with roles in three movies, including the vince vaughn comedy business trip (which... maybe she shouldn't get too excited about) and the true crime drama foxcatcher (which was originally set to open dec. 20 but has been pushed to an unspecified date this year). her personal life, too, is finally stable: miller and fiance tom sturridge welcomed their first daughter in july 2012. and maybe most importantly, the tumult of the past 10 years has helped miller understand what really matters — or, more specifically, what doesn't. (hint: everything.) take it away, sienna: ""when you're in some massive crisis and you look at yourself in a close-up and then if you visualize pulling back and seeing england and then pulling back and seeing the world, you realize how f—ing insignificant you are. i think that's really the greatest thing i've learned recently: that i don't matter. nothing matters. it's such a relief to know that. i didn't get that job -- it doesn't f—ing matter. whatever i achieve, or don't, will be forgotten, it's not important."" read the full interview at esquire uk. see the original article at ew.com. click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. all rights reserved.","miller says she ""burnt a lot of bridges"" in hollywood"
"(ew.com) -- since everything about les misérables is fortissimo — including but not limited to its unabashed pursuit of awards that are shiny or globular or both — you have perhaps already heard a little about the movie now storming the bastille of your wallet. you may already know that to make his movie adaptation of the internationally popular theatrical musical conjured from the 19th-century political novel by victor hugo, director tom hooper (the king's speech) bade his actors sing live during filming. you probably already know that anne hathaway, as the wretched single mother-turned-prostitute fantine, is reputedly a formidable oscar favorite for her sobbing and warbling and haircutting-in-real-time. you've learned, from posters and trailers, that hugh jackman, as former convict jean valjean, looks impressively stricken and that russell crowe, as implacable police inspector javert, looks disconcertingly dyspeptic. what's left to learn is this: les misérables provides compelling reasons for crowe to be peeved, beginning with the humiliation of having to sing broadway-style, when it clearly is so not his thing, and ending with the cap'n crunch wardrobe into which the gentleman is packed. (o, for crowe's costumed glory days in master and commander: the far side of the world!) jackman has a right to be cranky too, although he's too much of a trouper to show it as he overemotes on demand and sings of finding god after he steals a pair of candlesticks from a nice priest. (long story.) hathaway looks happy enough channeling liza minnelli for her tremulous rendition of the susan boyle-appropriated anthem ''i dreamed a dream,'' but that's no doubt because she knows that soon after the song, she's pretty much done for the night. shall i go on about all the ways in which this fake-opulent les miz made me long for guillotines while millions of viewers who have softer, more generous hearts than i may swoon with money's-worth contentment?

(he is similarly devoted to tilted perspective and the room-at-a-45-degree-angle shot.) it's a daunting challenge, to be sure, to turn a big musical into a viable movie. for every great cabaret, my fair lady, and the king and i, there's a dud rent, evita, and mamma mia! but this steam-driven military weapon of an enterprise is a sobering reminder of just how tinny a musical les misérables was in the first place — the listless music and lyrics by alain boubil, claude-michel schönberg, and herbert kretzmer, the derivative characters fashioned from oliver! scraps. and even if you do come to mr. hooper's neighborhood loving the show, having seen seven stage productions and named your cat gavroche after the urchin who hitches his fate to those of grown-up revolutionaries, well, you're in for a gobsmacking: this ''prestige'' production is at heart a minor road-show carnival, leaving behind little but tinsel as it rumbles through the streets of awardstown. grade: c see original story at ew.com. click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. all rights reserved.",the film is an adaptation of the 19th-century political novel by victor hugo
"-- as former governors, we were honored to serve the people of our respective states. while we represent different political parties, we are united in our belief that government has stopped working for the american people -- and that real reform of the electoral process is needed to get it back on track. as we look at our politics today, we are deeply troubled by the corrosive role that special interest money has come to play in determining who runs for office and who wins, and its influence over what policy decisions that are made in the legislative process. policymakers in our nation's capital seem incapable of addressing our most pressing challenges, and the hyper-partisanship of recent times is only made worse by the fact congress is dependent on the funders, not the voters. indeed, surveys consistently indicate large majorities of americans agree that wealthy special interests have too much sway over the political system. and if you look at where campaign contributions come from, they're right. in the last national election cycle, less than 1% of the population was responsible for providing the vast majority of campaign funds, with 0.1% of citizens contributing $2,500 or more in the last election and accounting for fully 67% of total itemized donations. opinion: why washington is corrupt we know of only one way to fundamentally change our broken pay-to-play system: public funding of elections. the concept is straightforward - put ownership of our public elections in the hands of voters, not special-interest donors, and the politicians who are elected will be accountable to them. while the need for campaign reform on the national level may be painfully self-evident, there is little sign of attention or movement from either end of pennsylvania avenue. there is a significant opportunity for success in new york state, however, as a many lawmakers and governor andrew cuomo support the enactment of a campaign finance reform package that includes a system of public funding of elections. legislation based on the very successful small donor matching fund system that has been in operation in new york city for 25 years has passed the state assembly, and now it is up to the state senate to follow suit. the new york city system is voluntary, giving a candidate the option of opting in, and it enjoys strong public support, encouraging political competition while greatly increasing the participation of small donors and curtailing the influence of special interests in city government. in addition, three states offer candidates for public office to compete in this way -- arizona, connecticut, and maine. qualified citizens from all walks of life are able to serve, and the relationship between money and politics is greatly reduced. in new jersey, public funding of elections is available to candidates for governor, allowing candidates who qualify with a greater ability to run for office and get their ideas before voters. as a result of federal court decisions that equate political expenditures with the exercise of the first amendment, participation in public funding of elections systems must be voluntary in order to meet constitutional muster. the current campaign finance system will not be wholly replaced, but public funding of elections allows candidates without access to large donors and special-interest backing to compete against those candidates who do, as the practical experience in new york city and the states that have full public funding of elections strongly demonstrate. new york's campaign finance system is built for the big donor -- not the average voter. individuals can contribute up to $60,800 to a single candidate, more than 10 times the limit to presidential candidates. the end result is that the vast majority of citizens who can't afford to make big donations feel shut out and disconnected from those that represent them. in addition to small donor public financing, lowering contribution limits will enhance the participation of citizens in new york's political system. the public supports this fundamental reform of our political system strongly, both nationally and in new york state. a recent public opinion survey indicated that 80% of independents, 75% of democrats and 68% of republicans support a small donor matching system of public funding of elections. voters need to hold their elected officials accountable, letting them know that supporting and participating in a reformed campaign finance system is a voting issue. campaign finance reform in new york state will not only improve how albany works, it has national implications. new york can lead the way, providing a beacon to the nation. a son of new york, president theodore roosevelt proposed a system of public funding of elections in 1905. this is in keeping with the grand tradition of innovation that new yorkers have led in the past, and enacting campaign finance reform with a small donor match as its centerpiece will continue that tradition. making our political system work for the american people is a cause that political leaders across the spectrum can and should get behind. we urge the new york legislature and governor cuomo to work enact campaign finance reform now. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of howard dean and christine todd whitman.","howard dean, christine todd whitman: government has stopped working for the people"
"-- over the last few weeks, there has been a definite italian flavor pervading ""the screening room"" offices. nanni moretti's (pictured) ""dear diary"": ""it transmits a great love of place and cinema,"" says marshall. the team is recently back from the venice international film festival, where we broadened our knowledge of this years's film offerings, while vast amounts of pasta unfortunately had the same effect on our waistlines. italian film has also expanded its horizons this year. paolo sorrentino's ""il divo"" and matteo garrone's ""gomorrah"" wowed critics at cannes film festival, fueling, once again, talk of a resurgence in italian cinema. with all this in mind, we asked rome-based film critic of 14 years, lee marshall to nominate his top 10 italian films. don't agree? think he's missed one? let us know in the soundoff box below. 1. 'la strada' (federico fellini, 1954) ""absolutely wonderful film with giulietta masina and anthony quinn. she was tiny and had an almost clown-like face, like a female charlie chaplin. it's about a loose couple of traveling circus performers who go around italy juggling in the street. it's also one of the greatest tragic love stories ever filmed. quinn's character doesn't realize how important his partner is in life and work until it's too late. 'the magic of cinema' is a phrase thrown around too much, but this film shows just how magical it can be."" 2.'the conformist' (bernardo bertolucci, 1970) ""italy, like germany, had a post-war trauma syndrome and refused to think about what had happened under fascism. this was one of the first films to confront it head-on -- it wasn't a strange race of aliens, it was us and one of the reasons was the pressure to conform. 'the conformist' is the story of a weak man who is persuaded by fascist secret police to assassinate his former university professor, now a leading anti-fascist. the film explores the way in which the totalitarian state manipulates people and the way people allow themselves to be manipulated. a technically, aesthetically and visually rich film, it announced the arrival of bertolucci as a major director."" 3. 'ossessione' (luchino visconti, 1943) ""it was the first film (even before the first american film) based on the book adaptation of 'the postman always rings twice.' set in rural italy, it is an incredibly earthy, passionate exploration of human desire. a drifter gets a job in a remote service station and starts to fall in love with the owner's wife; the pair plot to kill him. it is considered one of the first films of the neo-realism movement -- low budget films, made on location using non-professional actors. the classic of this strand is vittorio de sica's 'bicycle thieves.'"" 4. 'l'avventura' (michelangelo antonioni, 1960) ""starring monica vitti, this is one of the first really experimental films in modern italian cinema. it was one of the first thrillers in which you never find out what happened. a woman disappears on a mediterranean island and is never found, which becomes a metaphor for what antonioni thought was missing in middle-class italian society. it's a compelling drama. you feel a bit cheated at the end, but you can forgive a slap in the face if it's done with enough elegance."" 5. 'a fistful of dollars' (sergio leone, 1964) ""the film that announced the spaghetti western to the world. it also turned clint eastwood's rugged face and narrowed eyes into an icon. eastwood owes his acting career to leone. they made the western genre a lot darker, too. traditionally, these were optimistic films about pushing back the frontier, part of the american dream. in spaghetti westerns it became about survival. that's what clint is doing in this film. he moves into a town where two rival families are engaged in a bitter feud and then maneuvers events so they wipe each other out and he is the last man standing."" 6. 'the battle of algiers' (gillo pontecorvo,1966) ""a extraordinary film about the resistance against french occupation in algeria in the 1950s and 1960s. if you look at, say, steven soderbergh's 'che' or paul greengrass' film 'bloody sunday,' they owe a huge debt to 'the battle of algiers.' one of the first films made anywhere in the world about war; there weren't any goodies or baddies, just roving cameras following the chaotic day-to-day bomb attacks. it also shows the brutality that was then applied by the french police in an almost documentary way. it was just holding up a mirror and this was the first war film to do that."" 7. 'dear diary' (nanni moretti, 1993) ""moretti is a film maverick who first emerged in the mid-1970s, whose films are always in some way autobiographical. he's probably, the closest thing italy has to woody allen, except his films have a more political slant. he's a great comic actor and merges politics and comedy in his films. 'dear diary' is just a diary in three episodes. one of those films that manages to be incredibly rich and satisfying, but when you describe the story it sounds inconsequential. it's just him riding around in rome on a vespa with a voice-over where he's talking about films. it transmits a great love of place and cinema -- as well as riding around rome on a vespa being brilliantly cinematic."" 8. 'cabiria' (giovanni pastrone,1914) ""the italian 'the birth of a nation' or 'metropolis' -- a great silent film that defined italian silent cinema. it's quite a wild ancient history epic about a woman called cabiria sold into slavery in carthage. an extraordinary experiment -- it was one of the first times in italy that cinema, having been a fairground entertainment, was starting to be considered as potentially high art. a brilliantly exotic, erotic take on ancient history and wonderfully over the top."" 9. ""the consequences of love' (paolo sorrentino, 2004) ""one of the best italian films of the last 10 years. it's an interesting take on the mafia film and an alternative love story. it is about an accountant living in a hotel in switzerland, leading an uneventful, measured life. all the violence happens off to one side and its absence is almost menacing. you don't realize there is anything shady about him for a long time and a love affair develops with the hotel receptionist. i think sorrentino is a very original new voice."" 10. 'pane, amore e fantasia' (luigi comencini, 1953) ""starring gina lollobrigida and vittorio de sica, this is a wonderfully innocent, sexy comedy set in central italy in a little village that is incredibly backward and rural. it's about a young woman who is courted by a lot of admirers, including a local police chief. it's really about the feisty, unputdownable spirit of italy. when we think of italy, even in a slightly cliched way -- spaghetti, sun and the whole cult of love, the feisty women and the men playing lotharios -- this film just embodies that vibrant life force and energy. it's a very funny romantic comedy.""","there is a distinct italian flavor pervading ""the screening room"" this month"
"-- a revolution squeezed into its margins -- but that's where it started. it is february 11, 2014. three years ago today, i walked to tahrir square to celebrate the fall of a dictator. in that square, we felt everything was possible, after mubarak's 30-year rule. it's that feeling a recent film, ""the square"" tried to capture. i resisted watching this oscar-nominated film for weeks. i was in egypt for many of the events it portrayed, and i knew i'd be emotionally riven if the film were even partially accurate. indeed, it was painful to watch a film that captured so many of the core emotions of the past three years, and did it so well. the film did not portray my own memories: it mediated the emotional history of the revolution through the subjective experiences of certain key characters. they were all archetypes of the revolution. i wondered -- would the filmmakers do what so many writers on egypt have done, and go for the easy way out, focusing on spoiled rich kids, playing revolutionary? they didn't -- the first revolutionary character, ahmad, is hardly rich -- he's a young, middle class, average egyptian. another central character is magdy -- a loyal member of the muslim brotherhood, the political islamist group. ahmad has struggled economically his whole short life -- magdy has spent time imprisoned for his political beliefs. there was betrayal. it began with mubarak himself, addressing the youth of tahrir with such tenderness -- only to try to crush them. it continued with the military's leadership saluting the revolution's martyrs after mubarak was forced from office -- only to be shown, unsympathetically, displaying singular disinterest in revolutionary reforms. it lingered with the brotherhood's leadership insisting on revolutionary intentions -- only to be seen deserting the revolutionary struggle for partisan power. there was hope. the hope that all of egypt would become tahrir square of the 18 days: a place of respect, pluralism, and freedom. those that had hope now strive to ensure the hope itself doesn't die. there was anger, as we see the potential of the revolution squandered -- and the anger remains. there was naivetã© -- the naivetã© of the revolutionaries to understand where their power was, and where it wasn't. on the second anniversary of the uprising, i was near tahrir square trying to convince some activists that, actually, they'd lost the public's support for protests some time before. the protest, for too many of them, had become the strategy itself, as opposed to a tactic for a better-defined goal. considering the film's partiality to the ideals of revolution, i was pleasantly surprised to see the idealism of one of the characters, egyptian-briton khalid, challenged, more than once. ahmad shows an innocent unwariness about the june 30 protests against then-president mohamed morsy: the film would have benefited from showing a counter to his exceedingly ill-placed confidence that the military of 2013 would be more restrained than the military of 2011. there was pain. there was the killing of largely christian protesters at maspero by the military in late 2011 -- a tragedy the film crew witnessed, and which turned a sizeable number against the military. there have now been more than a dozen ""mass protester killings,"" as the egyptian initiative for personal rights put it -- and no acknowledgement or justice for them. the single worst incident was the clearing of the pro-morsy sit-in -- a scene insufficiently covered in the film, though mentioned. the film is not the story of every egyptian, or even every revolutionary. it's a mediation of the revolutionary experience through these specific characters. the film is a story of the relationships of these individual characters with the revolution, and with each other. even though this is a deeply political film, political parties are rarely shown. central, nevertheless, to the film's development, is the persona of magdy, a loyal brotherhood member. he humanizes ordinary brotherhood members, and of all the central characters, we know magdy as the most tortured, who suffered the most under mubarak's regime. magdy's story is a profoundly conflicted one, as he struggles between his loyalty to an organization that supported him his whole life, and his ideals. his story causes others to be conflicted as well -- we see that although ahmad opposes the brotherhood deeply, he wants to come to the pro-morsy sit-in towards the end, to stand by magdy. a deeply sympathetic and gallant character, magdy survives the clearing of the sit-in, unlike the many hundreds who did not. the film certainly prioritizes a revolutionary lens, rather than pretending to be a bland chronicle, for these tragic revolutionary heroes provided the context of the square and the revolution. watching it now reminds us that in the past few months and years, many who would have been in that square would have been killed, or imprisoned. the film reminds us of a revolution that has been squeezed into the margins -- but also reminds us that, indeed, is where the revolution itself started. read: how america abandoned egypt's arab spring read: egypt's revolution on the margins the views expressed in this piece are solely those of h.a. hellyer.",oscar-nominated 'the square' traces egypt's revolution through revolutionaries
"""what, are you insane?"" that seems to be the response i get most from friends and family members when i tell them that i'd like another child one day. they are typically shocked not because i'm pregnant with my second child but because they've watched me suffer through hyperemesis gravidarum during both of my pregnancies. they know that pregnancy for me is never a glowing and magical journey. rather, it is weekly trips to the emergency room, in-home ivs and nursing care, up to 13 medications with their assorted side effects and, of course, frequent vomiting -- sometimes as many as 20 times a day. although i normally choose to greet my acquaintances' surprise with a simple smile and ""we'll see how i feel about it later,"" i decided to speak out after learning that britain's duke and duchess of cambridge are expecting their second child. the palace says catherine is again suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, as she did during her first pregnancy. it might seem crazy to some that i would have wanted more kids after my first hyperemesis gravidarum battle, but i simply refuse to let it define my family planning. hyperemesis gravidarum manages to rob its victims of many of the joys of pregnancy. because you can no longer keep up with your usual obligations, you often have to share with your community that you are pregnant before you're out of the ""danger zone"" of the first trimester, making you vulnerable to having to tell people later if you've suffered a miscarriage. since you are so sick, what should be a happy time for you and your family becomes a nightmare, as you are unable to help around the house or spend time with other children or your partner, and are oftentimes unable to work and contribute financially. hyperemesis gravidarum even managed to take away the joy of feeling my daughter hannah kick once i realized her movements were setting off the nausea. but what hyperemesis gravidarum can't take away is the last 10 years of joy i've gotten from being hannah's mom. the moment hannah came out, i looked at her tiny face and knew that every second of sickness, every expensive doctor's bill, every time i'd felt desperate and depressed and doubted myself as a mother, was worth it. and as soon as hannah was out, i felt this pang of hunger that i hadn't felt in months. i turned to the nurse and asked when i could eat. about 30 minutes later, she brought me a plate of lasagna that i gobbled up and -- more important -- kept down. the hyperemesis gravidarum was finally gone, and the only thing left was my adorable baby, who has grown into one of the strongest little people i know and one of my closest friends. i never once thought about the hyperemesis gravidarum when i watched her take her first steps, perform in her preschool play, sound out her first word, present her first science fair project, compete in her first gymnastics meet or any of the other incredible memories we've shared. the nine months of sickness i had with her in utero were nothing in comparison to the 10 years i've enjoyed as her mom. so even on my darkest days during this pregnancy, the ones where i am reduced to a smelly, tearful, nauseated lump on the couch, i've thought about those moments in hannah's life and smiled, knowing that i am going to get to experience all of those again with this daughter come february 1. i belong to an online community of women who have survived or are currently suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, sort of a support group and resource community all in one. from time to time, someone will write a post saying they are at their wit's end, ready to give up, or feel like they are losing their mind. within minutes, the responses will pour in: photos of recently born babies from hyperemesis gravidarum survivors, descriptions of a new milestone someone's little one has achieved and even tales from women still suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum of how much better they are feeling that particular week. i love when a few weeks later, the original poster comments on someone else's post to tell them how they survived those desperate times and found the strength to keep going. surviving acute pregnancy sickness: my story although there were some moments where i wanted to give up, hyperemesis gravidarum has made me appreciate my life and my family so much more than i ever could have if i hadn't been sick. perhaps, next time someone asks me if i've lost my mind, i'll simply hold up a picture of my daughter and tell them ""absolutely not.""",hyperemesis gravidarum causes extreme sickness during pregnancy
"-- if you know much about the real-time strategy game ""starcraft ii,"" you may have heard a term that will sound completely bizarre to people outside the video game world: a.p.m. it stands for actions per minute, and it refers to the number of keyboard and mouse clicks a person can make during 60 seconds of time. the best players tend to average about 200 to 400 actions per minute, said park sang-ik, a ""starcraft ii"" coach in south korea, which long has been home to the world's best players, who train professionally and can earn six figures. ""i don't think there is a particular way to make your hands move faster,"" he said. but don't fret. coaches say a.p.m. is becoming less important in the competitive ""starcraft"" world, particularly as more people jump to the sequel version of the game, from blizzard entertainment. and there are plenty of other tips the pros have to offer in addition to making your fingers move like those of thing, the hand that runs all over the place in ""the addams family."" here are five such tips, compiled from interviews with three of south korea's best ""starcraft ii"" players, including mvp, marineking and supernova, as well as their coaches. test them out and let us know what you think in the comments section below. 1. finger exercises. like a piano player practicing scales, pro ""starcraft ii"" player marineking does keyboard runs when he's warming up for a big match. some of the fidgety exercises he practices are ""+a1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9a0"" and ""asdf asdf."" 2. mental health. mental toughness is the most important aspect of ""starcraft ii,"" said kang dong-hoon, coach of team incredible miracle, home to world champ mvp. players should clear their minds before they play, he said, and they should visualize their strategies before a match. such visualization will help players get off to a strong start and finish well, he said. 3. physical health. it may sound strange, but pro video-gaming teams in south korea include physical exercise as part of their training regiment. mvp's team runs, swims and lifts weights. 4. know your enemy. the pros watch tape of their opponents' previous games before entering into a battle with them. do they strike early? what are their common mistakes? this kind of analysis helps the player come up with a specific strategy to go for the win. many weak players fall into routines, said kang, from incredible miracle. the easiest way to beat someone is to spot and exploit these patterns. 5. keep at it. pro gamers in south korea live at training centers, where they practice playing video games almost round the clock on some days. all of this practice seems to pay off. south koreans are regarded as the dominant power in online gaming, particularly the ""starcraft"" franchise. kang said players in the country practice so much that ""normal people can't imagine"" what it would be like.","pros and coaches offer ""starcraft ii"" training tips"
"-- a blistering heat wave retreated to the south wednesday, bringing some relief to the ohio valley and northeastern united states. the number of states under heat advisories has diminished to 12 -- half the number earlier in the week. dangerous heat is expected across parts of northern texas through thursday evening, according to the national weather service. dallas, fort worth, arlington and other areas will experience afternoon heat indices of 105 degrees or more through thursday. other states still sweltering under heat advisories include oklahoma, louisiana, arkansas, missouri, tennessee, mississippi, alabama, georgia, south carolina, north carolina and virginia. many tennesseans should expect the heat index to be between 110 and 114 degrees for the rest of the week, according to the national weather service. ""i just had to stop once in a while and catch a breath, it was just that tough to breathe,"" said marion, illinois, resident ceasar maragni, who opted to stay inside tuesday after a swampy monday evening trip to the williamson county fair. even the frozen lemonade vendor was lagging with few customers in the nearly 100-degree evening heat, he said. other areas of the country not under heat advisories touted new record highs tuesday. newark, new jersey, broke its previous record of 98, set in 1966, when it hit 99 degrees. jfk airport and islip, new york, did the same, reporting 97 and 93 degrees respectively, beating 1993 records of 94 degrees at jfk and 91 in islip. in central oklahoma, temperatures in some places shot past the 100 mark for the 14th consecutive day tuesday. highs in much of the state are likely to flirt with triple-digits for almost another week, according to the national weather service. high demand for water amid the heat wave and problems with soil shrinking as the ground warms has resulted in burst pipes and low water pressure in oklahoma city. this prompted officials to issue mandatory water-use restrictions for the first time in at least a decade, according to utilities department spokeswoman debbie ragan. more than 200 people have suffered from heat-related emergencies in tulsa and oklahoma city since june 17, when the agency issued its first heat alert, said lara o'leary, spokeswoman for the emergency medical services authority of oklahoma. the heat has been so extreme that a portion of the cimarron turnpike in pawnee county, oklahoma, buckled on sunday, creating a 2-foot ramp that sent a motorcyclist flying 150 feet through the air. in addition to the discomfort and potential danger, the heat could wreak havoc on crops, especially corn, said chad hart, assistant professor of agricultural economics at iowa state university. the heat wave comes at a sensitive time for corn, he said. ""that's why markets are watching the heat wave. we're entering a period of time when corn pollinates, and so if you get a heat wave in the early- to mid-part of july across iowa, illinois and indiana, it can have a big impact,"" he said. ""the last time we had a big heat wave and drought was in 1988, and that year we saw corn production fall off by over 30% ... so if we think of where we are today with already-high corn prices, a true drought scenario can push prices to highs we've never seen before."" temperatures will return to nearly normal summertime levels by wednesday throughout the northeast, said chris vaccaro, a spokesman for the national weather service. high pressure over the plains is keeping the weather pattern stable, allowing heat to build. a cooler, dryer weather system is nibbling at the northern edges of the heat wave, threatening to exchange high temperatures for potentially dangerous thunderstorms, according to forecasters. there's not quite so much relief in store for residents of the lower midwest and south. ""this has been going on all weekend and will continue into this week,"" vaccaro said. in oklahoma city, forecasters are calling for nearly another full week of temperatures near or above 100 degrees, threatening to break a 1936 record for 22 consecutive days of such heat. nighttime will bring little solace. while record- and near-record daytime highs are being set, many areas are also experiencing record warm lows at night. for instance, the low temperature of 83 recorded early tuesday in north little rock, arkansas, set a new record for the warmest low in july, vaccaro said. warm nights are a problem for people without air conditioning, he said. ""if you're exposed to the outside elements, your body can't cool down at night,"" he said. the heat has already claimed at least one victim, a 51-year-old man in granite city, illinois, who died sunday because of the excessive heat, according to the madison county coroner. forecasters say people should limit outdoor activity during the hottest portions of the day, wear lightweight clothing, drink plenty of water and be watchful for signs of heat exhaustion, which include heavy sweating, pale and clammy skin, weak pulse, fainting and vomiting. cnn's monica o'connor, meteorologist jacqui jeras, ed payne, karen smith and chelsea bailey contributed to this report.",the national weather service has taken down heat advisories in some states

""this latest massive influx of people, who have endured extreme conditions, will put an even greater strain on the transit and idp sites that are already buckling under the pressure of the existing idp population,"" the u.n. high commissioner for refugees said in a written statement. the agency pledged to erect an additional 10,000 shelters to accommodate people streaming from the combat zone. it reiterated its request for the sri lankan government to set aside land for the construction of emergency shelters, water and sanitation facilities and public buildings in vavuniya, jaffna, mannar and kilinochchi. and it called on the government to improve conditions at 42 sites already hosting the displaced people, and to ensure adequate care and maintenance for them. but the united nations said its access to the sites in vavuniya had been curtailed in recent days ""and this affects our ability to monitor and distribute aid to the displaced. we hope this ends quickly."" suresh bartlett, aid agency world vision's national director, said, ""the conventional war may be over but the real challenge now is to foster an environment where fractured and displaced tamil communities can heal and have a real chance at creating a future for themselves and their children."" among the pressing issues, he said, is getting people back to their land and homes as quickly as possible, which in some cases will require that land be demined and buildings be repaired. about 80,000 of the displaced -- a third of the people in camps -- are children, who need emotional, psychosocial and educational support in addition to physical aid. ""it is important to get people home as quickly as possible so they can feel a sense of ownership over their own lives, recover their dignity and livelihoods and create an environment where their children feel safe,"" he said. in a telephone interview from colombo, sri lanka's most populous city, bartlett said that the displacement camps are overcrowded, with two and three families staying in shelters intended for a single family. ""a lot more needs to be done,"" he said. ""more land needs to be cleared, more shelters set up"" and safe drinking-water supplies assured. ""it's not easy and it's not straightforward."" he said many of the people still streaming into the camps are malnourished. though the end of the conflict marks a great opportunity, ""we can do with all the international support that we can get at this time,"" he said. estimates put the number of civilians killed in the conflict at 70,000 to 80,000, but bartlett acknowledged that the true number may never be known. medecins sans frontieres, the aid group also known as doctors without borders, was trying to scale up on monday, a spokeswoman said. the group's head of mission, hugues robert, said the 1999 nobel peace prize-winning organization is staffing three hospitals in the region, where it was screening people seeking help to determine their needs, stabilize them, then treat them. with fighting apparently ended, robert predicted that the organization's team of 343 national staff and approximately 50 international staff will focus many of their efforts on providing post-operative care. ""we have a lot of wounded people,"" he said. one area of need that remains largely unaddressed, he said, is mental health. amnesty international called for steps to be taken to ensure civilians and captured fighters are protected. ""the sri lankan government must ensure that its forces fully respect international law, including all provisions relating to protecting civilians from the effect of hostilities,"" said amnesty international's asia-pacific director, sam zarifi. amnesty international called on the sri lankan government to give humanitarian agencies full access; to allow independent observers to monitor the situation to guard against human-rights violations; and to register displaced people as a safeguard against enforced disappearances. zarifi called on the international community to deploy monitors. in washington, u.s. state department spokesman ian kelly called the end of fighting ""an opportunity for sri lanka to turn the page on its past and build a sri lanka rooted in democracy, tolerance, and respect for human rights."" he said it is ""vital for the government to provide for the needs of the civilians now living in relief camps. providing food, water, shelter, basic health care, and sanitation as well as expediting their return to their homes should be a top priority for the government.""","u.n.: 65,000 people flee fighting zone in northeast sri lanka in past days"

""i've said it a lot -- it's nice to beat records but the win for the team is what is important and the points difference at the top,"" messi told reporters after barca retained a six-point lead over second-placed atletico madrid. messi's next challenge is to become the first man to win the world player of the year award four times, as he heads the shortlist for january's ceremony along with clubmate andres iniesta and real madrid's cristiano ronaldo. ""if iniesta wins, it will be well-deserved for all that he has done, for the way he plays. again, it will also be a prize for the dressing room,"" messi said of the spain midfielder, who beat him to last season's top european award. click here to see a map of messi's first 84 goals of 2012 he is already barcelona's alltime leading scorer, having in march surpassed the 232 goal mark set by cesar rodriguez in the 1950s. last season he scored a record 50 goals in la liga, and he already has 23 this term. of his 86 for 2012, 74 have been for barcelona and 12 for his country. the world has yet to see the best of messi on the international stage, as he has yet to win a senior title with argentina -- and that is the challenge he next faces if is to be known as a true great, according to british football journalist henry winter. ""pele did it for brazil and maradona for argentina. in the 2014 world cup on brazilian soil it'll be wonderful to see messi show the world what a special, special player he is,"" winter told cnn on sunday. messi vs. muller: the goal kings ""they say top players hit their peak at 27 or 28 when they have the maturity and the game craft and still the athleticism of youth. i think we'll see a player like messi who's very humble, very grounded, continuing to work and develop with the great barcelona players he's got around him, like xavi and iniesta. ""he'll be the first to pay tribute to his teammates as well, because they are important."" winter paid tribute to the humility of messi, who became a father for the first time last month. ""he's a fantastic role model, not just for his club but for football generally,"" winter said. ""he doesn't cheat -- he gets whacked by some serious tackles, but he's strong mentally physically -- even though he's not the tallest or most imposing of individuals. ""he just keeps going because he's got this great lust for goals, for scoring, for setting up his teammates. he's the ultimate team player, an ambassador on and off the pitch."" messi's exploits came after it appeared he might be upstaged by atletico madrid's freescoring radamel falcao, who became the first player in more than a decade to net five times in a la liga match. the colombia international took his league tally to 16 this season as second-placed atletico kept the pressure on leaders barca with a 6-0 thrashing of bottom team deportivo la coruna. falcao joined ronaldo on 13 goals with a first-half double, then completed his hat-trick with a penalty after being fouled. he added two more to seal atletico's eighth successive home win and guarantee that speculation about his future will intensify ahead of the january transfer window, with some of the world's biggest clubs interested in signing the 26-year-old former porto player.",barcelona soccer star lionel messi breaks world record for goals in a calendar year
"-- an armed christian organization which had pledged to protect a florida church as it holds ""international burn a quran day"" withdrew its support from the event wednesday, saying it ""does not glorify god,"" according to a posting on its website. right wing extreme, which describes itself as a christian conservative group, also said in the posting it is asking the dove world outreach center, based in gainesville, florida, not to hold the event ""for the reason that it may diminish the work of the holy spirit to witness to muslims."" the event is planned for the ninth anniversary of the september 11 terror attacks. while the group agrees with the dove center's stance on islam, press coverage of recent events, such as ""burn a quran day,"" a recent ""everybody draw mohammed day"" group on facebook and the controversy surrounding a proposed mosque and islam community center near ground zero in new york is ""really inciting a lot of hatred and a lot of violence that's going on,"" right wing extreme founder shannon carson told cnn.

""of course, we are very surprised, and of course disappointed,"" jones said. ""i talked to (carson) personally and he was very excited about the stand that we had taken against islam. he had already reviewed a lot of our information, youtube (videos) -- he was 100 percent supportive in what we were doing."" carson said since pledging its support and saying it would provide protection for the dove center, ""we've all received several death threats"" from the united states and beyond. the group has been in contact with the fbi, he said. carson said he believes other groups may follow right wing extreme and withdraw their support from the event as well. he said he will ask the dove center not to hold the event, but does not know whether they will proceed. ""we're not against them, we're just pulling our support,"" he said. jones pointed out that right wing extreme had contacted the dove center to offer its help along with financial support, not vice versa. ""there was at that time absolutely no indication that they were not supportive,"" jones said. ""i can only come to the conclusion -- it seems very, very obvious -- they ... have bowed to fear or to pressure from other organizations, other groups."" he said the group has taken the easy way out by saying ""god would not do this."" but, jones said, that's not the point of the event. ""this is sending a clear warning to radical islam that they are not welcome in america."" he said the church will proceed with the event. jones told cnn in an e-mail on tuesday he had accepted the support of right wing extreme, which he said offered to come to the church with between 500 and 2,000 men. jones described the organization as an armed civilian militia group. ""there is a need for this protection,"" jones wrote in an e-mail. ""it is absolutely necessary in light of the death and terror threats we have received. we have met with the fbi who have warned us of the threats they have seen, not only against us but against other targets in florida. we have personally received threats by phone and many by mail."" right wing extreme said in its web posting wednesday, ""dove world outreach are our brothers and sisters in christ. however, we ask that they not hold this event for the reason that it may diminish the work of the holy spirit to witness to muslims. ""america is a nation founded on the bible,"" it said. ""capitalism, our form of government, our laws and our freedoms come directly from the bible. sharia law, however is based not on freedom, but totalitarianism."" the system oppresses women and freedom of speech, along with ""basic rights that americans have fought and died for,"" the group said. but, carson noted wednesday, ""we need to calm down here ... the whole violence thing, this is going to get real ugly real quick if this keeps stewing."" on tuesday, carson said in a statement sent to cnn by the dove center that ""we fully support dove world outreach center and its efforts to put an end to the notion that islam is a peaceful religion. islam is a violent cult with the goal of world domination."" he repeated that on wednesday. ""it's not that we don't agree with dove's stance on islam, because we believe it's not a religion, but a cult. we do have freedom of religion but when it is a violent religion, or cult, as islam is, that is invading our nation, we don't support that,"" he said. carson said he has spoken with jones and his staff on the issue previously. carson said right wing extreme is opposed to the plan to build the mosque and islamic community center near the site of the attacks on the world trade center in new york, saying it's ""spitting in the face"" of the 9/11 families. jones said freedom of religion in american means ""muslims are more than free to worship here, which is not the case in sharia law-dominated countries. they only have to respect and obey the constitution"" and not force sharia law on others, he said. ""this is just a typical giving in to pressure and fear,"" he said of right wing extreme's withdrawal. muslims and many other christians, including some evangelicals, are fighting the church's plan to burn the quran. religious leaders in gainesville have planned an event billed as a ""gathering for peace, understanding and hope"" on september 10 as a response to the church's proposal. the islamic advocacy group council on american-islamic relations has called on muslims and others to host ""share the quran"" dinners to educate the public. in a statement, the group has said it will give out 100,000 copies of the quran to local, state and national leaders.",new: church says it is surprised by the development
"-- the consumer product safety commission is suing the maker of popular high-powered magnet ""desk toys"" to get them to stop selling their products, an agency spokesman said wednesday. the magnets can pierce holes in the intestines, and some children have needed multiple surgeries and lengthy hospitalizations. since 2009, there have been at least a dozen ingestions of the magnets in buckyballs toys. powerful magnets in toys raise risks from swallowing the commission asked the makers of buckyballs and buckycubes to stop selling their products, but they refused, according scott wolfson, a spokesman for the federal agency. ""we're doing this to keep children safe,"" wolfson said. ""we want to prevent future surgeries."" a spokesman for maxfield & oberton, the maker of buckyballs and buckycubes, said the company ""will fight this vigorously."" ""there are half a billion magnets out there, and unfortunately there are some people who have misused the product,"" said andrew frank. ""we market these products to adults age 14 and above, and there are warning labels on the product."" there are warning labels to keep the magnets away from children on five places on each box, and in accompanying instructions. a public awareness campaign about magnet safety with videos distributed by the government and a special website (www.magnetsafety.com) was launched several months ago, with the full cooperation of the consumer product safety commission, the company said. the company's website also has warnings posted next to the images of the products. ""obviously the bureaucrats see danger everywhere, and those responsible people -- like our company who have vigorously promoted safety and appropriate use of our products -- gets put out of business by an unfair and arbitrary process,"" said craig zucker, founder and ceo of maxfield and oberton. ""i don't understand how and why they did this without following their own rules before allowing us to make our case. it almost seems like they simply wanted to put our products and industry out of business."" magnetic stress relievers called health danger for kids on friday, maxfield and oberton launched a video campaign to help educate consumers about ongoing safety efforts, as well as ""protest the actions of the consumer product safety commission,"" it said in a statement. the video can be viewed on the company's website as well as the campaign website. since 2008, the consumer product safety commission has received 200 reports of ingestion of magnets of all kinds, wolfson said. the analysis released wednesday showed more than 20 ingestions were of high-powered, ""rare earth"" magnets. in june, pediatric gastroenterologists met with the consumer product safety commission and shared the results of an informal survey. thirty-four physicians reported 82 cases of high-powered magnet ingestions, most in children under age five. surgery was required in 26 cases to remove the magnets and nearly all required some type of endoscopy procedure. ""we have worked with the company over the years,"" wolfson said. ""we did a recall with them in 2010. yet the injuries still happened. in 2011 we worked with them on the education of consumers. incidents still happened. so we've reached a point where we really do need to take stronger action, which we're doing. we're filing a lawsuit."" several retailers, including amazon and brookstone, have agreed to stop selling the magnets. the consumer product safety commission rarely files such administrative complaints -- the last time it did was 11 years ago against the maker of bb guns, wolfson said. ""so many parents don't know about this hazard,"" wolfson said. ""they buy the products for themselves. maybe their child gets access to it. maybe they give it to their child. ""and the parents just need to know that two or more magnets are swallowed by a child, even a teenager -- we've had incidents with both young children and teenagers -- it can get caught in the small intestine, form an infection and then emergency surgery is needed. we want to avoid that."" wolfson added that the agency is continuing to look at the safety of other brands of small, high-powered ""rare earth"" magnets. meaghin jordan, whose son swallowed high-powered magnets, said she was ""relieved"" to hear about the complaint. when he was almost 2 years old, her son braylon swallowed eight magnets and spent two months in the hospital, most of that time in intensive care. ""this is wonderful,"" she said. ""i'm very glad they're taking action. if they can't sell them, then no one else can get hurt."" mattel ceo: 'rigorous standards' after massive toy recall cnn's karen caifa contributed to this report.",the cpsc is suing the makers of buckyballs and buckycubes
"-- a malaysian politician who drew gasps by evoking hitler in a congratulatory tweet to the german world cup team has apologized, in his own inimitable style. ""when germany whacked brazil, i unintentionally said something that hurt d feeling of d ppl in germany.my sincerest appology.long live bung."" a member of the united malays national organization, bung moktar radin posted his initial tweet on tuesday after germany knocked brazil out of the world cup with an impressive 7-1 win. ""well done..bravo...long live hitler..."", he tweeted to around 20,000 followers. predictably, a flurry of tweets followed, with many questioning bung's sanity and how he came to be in politics. to his credit, the mp responded, but perhaps not in a way some might have wished. to @shaike49's contention that he was a ""low class crazy mp,"" the politician wrote: ""u can get lost... and enjoy with the loser."" to @layzebone's direct statement: ""you're an idiot... educate yourself,"" the mp said: ""say its to ur self."" by thursday, bung's online antics had caught the attention of the malaysian prime minister najib razak who tweeted to his two million followers: ""the comments made by datuk bung moktar are unacceptable and wrong, and he will withdraw them."" he added: (bung) ""does not speak for malaysia, or for ordinary malaysians, who understand europe's tragic past, and respect its modern unity."" ""this should be a time of celebration for germany, and we wish them all the best in the final."" one might think after causing an online furore over a six-word post, the politician might take a break from twitter. not bung. within one hour of posting his apology, he responded to a user who said: ""try saying this in europe, and see how fast u get gun down,"" with ""im worried they might gun down u first."" on wednesday, bung defended his hitler reference, telling malaysia's star online: ""i don't know what's wrong with people sometimes.""

"the attorney for a 14-year-old florida girl charged with aggravated stalking that allegedly led to the suicide of a 12-year-old classmate told cnn that her client isn't responsible for a controversial facebook post that led to the suspect's arrest. police on monday arrested two girls, ages 14 and 12, in connection with the death of rebecca sedwick, who jumped from the top of an abandoned concrete plant last month. authorities said the 14-year-old girl was rebecca's chief tormenter, and the girl posted a taunting message saturday on the internet about what had happened. ""yes ik i bullied rebecca nd she killed her self but idgaf,"" the facebook post read. grady judd, sheriff of polk county, florida, said the online vernacular meant ""i don't give a (expletive)."" the 14-year-old's lawyer, andrea demichael, told cnn her client ""says that this is not as clear cut as it seems."" the girl denies she stalked rebecca and she hasn't accessed facebook recently, demichael said. the girls, minors who are not being named by cnn, were charged with aggravated stalking. rebecca's mother called the arrests the best birthday present her daughter, who would have turned 13 this weekend, could have received. ""because justice is finally being served,"" tricia norman told cnn. ""something's finally being done about these girls that are bullying her. that's all she ever wanted was somebody to listen and do something about it."" it all started with a boy the intense bullying that authorities say led to rebecca's suicide stemmed from a dispute between her and a former classmate over a boy they had both dated, police said tuesday. after the facebook post saturday, police contacted the suspects and their parents and asked them to come in, according to demichael, who advised her client not to do so. judd said his office acted after the taunting post. ""she forced this arrest,"" judd said of the 14-year-old's alleged decision to post the message. he said investigators don't believe her facebook account was compromised. parents, beware of bullying on sites you've never seen judd sent detectives to arrest her and a 12-year-old friend at their homes. they were booked monday, and the 12-year-old was released to her parents, judd said. the 14-year-old made her first court appearance tuesday and was being kept at a juvenile detention facility. friends have a falling out according to judd, the girl was upset that rebecca had once dated her current boyfriend and began bullying and harassing her more than a year ago when they were both students at a florida middle school. in addition to sending harassing messages over the internet, the girl physically attacked rebecca at least once, judd said. she also recruited the girl's former best friend -- the 12-year-old charged monday -- to bully her, judd said. demichael disputed there was any harassment or fight. she said the 14-year-old and rebecca did have a falling out over the boy, and there was some ""back and forth"" at school between the former friends, but the girl never threatened rebecca. ""she was actually upset at what happened to the victim,"" demichael said. are we too quick to cry 'bully'? 'i'm jumping' among the online messages that drove rebecca to jump to her death were, ""you should die"" and ""why don't you go kill yourself?"" judd said. the night before rebecca killed herself, authorities say, she messaged a boy she had befriended online, writing, ""i'm jumping. i can't take it anymore."" judd, clearly upset about the incident, expressed frustration that neither girl's parents were willing to bring them in for questioning. he said he was astonished to find out that the 14-year-old in the case was still being allowed to post to the internet after what had happened. he said he would charge the child's parents if he could, but said investigators were aware of no ""obvious charges"" against them. ""i'm aggravated that the parents aren't doing what they are supposed to be doing,"" he said. norman said she blamed the parents of the two girls and the staff at the middle school. she and rebecca reported the bullying to the school, she said. while bullying was not in itself against the law, judd said, the girls' actions allegedly harassing rebecca in school and online formed the basis for the stalking charge. he did not expect any other charges would be filed. no court date has yet been set for the girls, who judd said will probably not see any time in juvenile detention because they have no previous criminal records and the charge is a class-three felony, one step up from a misdemeanor under florida law. had rebecca been 17 or older, he said, authorities could have filed nothing more than misdemeanor charges. he implored parents to take more responsibility for the actions of their children online. ""we've lost sleep over that child dying needlessly, and we want to see things change,"" he said.

"-- volunteers toiled for hours on friday cleaning mostly man-made debris from a new york coastline, the scattered religious offerings from a growing hindu population in queens. the group has drawn concern among local conservationists after leaving offerings -- clothing, statues, plastic flowers and other items -- along the gateway national recreation area near jamaica bay. ""i was appalled to see the condition of the place,"" said new yorker nagassar ramgarib, a practicing hindu. ""it was really disgustingly filthy."" many defend the practice, considered a sacred hindu tradition. millions of worshippers leave offerings to the gods at india's ganges river each year. ""there are times when we feel that we need to come to the sea, to offer flowers and of course ... material things because we feel that flowers, they just go,"" said esther j. ramdeen, a spokeswoman for the east elmhurst temple, shiva mandir, who helped organize friday's clean-up. ""we see god in the sea,"" she said. what remains is a standoff between those who insist on practicing their beliefs unfettered and environmentalists who are trying to preserve the area for local marine life. affected by the buildup and inspired by a park ranger who helped remove debris with him several years earlier, ramgarib returned to his temple to encourage executives and its members to visit the park and see the destruction. ""it is the sea. it is something that we as hindus worship,"" he told them, ""it is the medium that we use from this life to the after-life."" ramgarib warned that if the area was continually polluted, his people could be banned. kathy krause, a supervisory park ranger of the gateway national recreation area who attended the clean-up, agrees the religious practices have put definite pressure on the bay. ""it's a rich biodiverse ecosystem but it's definitively suffering some major environmental issues,"" krause said. these extra items left on the bay are one of its biggest threats for jamaica bay, a national park that's home to more than 325 species of birds, invertebrates and sea life, krause said. ""they release nutrients into the bay that don't belong there, and it exacerbates the water pollution problem we have,"" she said. volunteers picking under rocks and through grass friday filled garbage bags of bottles, coconut shells, figurines and yards of cloth, all of which the group says they will try to recycle. ramdeen said the fabric, pulled and sometimes ripped from beneath the shoreline, is just another part of the material possessions offered to the gods. ""you see that the colors we're picking up are very pretty colors,"" she said ""and we as hindus think that we should give god the best."" the material collected by ramdeen's organization is washed before being sent back to india as clothing. ""so it was kind of a recycling process,"" she said of their efforts. ""it's amazing,"" krause said of the group's efforts. ""this just shows such wonderful turnout from the local community.""","conservationists, park rangers concerned about water pollution"
"lagos, nigeria (cnn)2014 has been another amazing year for startups in africa. more and more entrepreneurs turned their attention to building businesses that can solve the continent's problems and provide services it has long awaited. enterprises emerged to fix problems in payments, traffic and talent, while more entrepreneurs raised more money from investors than ever before. here, in no particular order are 10 of the most exciting young companies of the year. the list includes the startups i consider to have the most potential, to be the most viable -- not necessarily the most popular or hyped. sendy where: kenya in a nutshell: uber-style motorbike delivery service. what's unique: africa has delivery services and courier services but never before uber-style so you can track exactly where the deliver rider is via your phone app. sending packages is usually expensive and difficult in big, congested african cities like nairobi and lagos. many people use motorbikes to get to work to avoid getting stuck in traffic, so using motorbikes for deliveries is a smart, cheap, local solution. future moves: sendy is in a very strong position because e-commerce is growing and at some point those kinds of sites could integrate with companies like sendy. it could also potentially be acquired by a foreign company, perhaps amazon, if they decide to expand to kenya or south africa and want to invest in a delivery service that understands the terrain. angani where: kenya, east africa region in a nutshell: pay-as-you-go cloud computing what's unique: this is nothing new internationally, but the cloud computing space in kenya is nascent. angani are coming into the market trying to make prices affordable. what makes it cool is that you pay for what you use. you choose a plan and go. future moves: it may be difficult for angani to scale in a short time, given that all of their competitors in this new and growing market are established players. it remains to be seen whether their tactic of driving competition with low prices will attract enough customers. irofit where: nigeria in a nutshell: mobile payments without internet what's unique: their offering -- mobile payments over mobile networks -- is unique. it's something that hasn't been done before. making mobile payments over the internet can often be an issue in africa, so irofit are leveraging more widespread mobile networks. future moves: they launched very recently, and no one has used the app yet. but irofit raised $600,000 in just six months earlier this year, showing that there are big players who think the startup has real potential. wyzetalk where: south africa in a nutshell: invite-only social platform for business what's unique: a business platform for companies to help their employees to more effectively communicate. staff can use the platform to collaborate on projects, set up meetings, instant message, share files and more. future moves: wyzetalk has been around since 2011, but they have built the company steadily, winning round after round of funding, which shows they must be doing something right. it is currently used by companies from a variety of industries including travel and tourism, tech and food and drink. they have a very solid model and are likely to keep growing. gamsole where: nigeria, global in a nutshell: gaming company what's unique: celebrated as the biggest success story of any african game developers, this startup has been developing games in the windows phone market for a couple of years. gamsole was incubated in the 88mph accelerator and since then their games have seen 9 million downloads globally. future moves: gamsole recently received an innovation grant from microsoft and are looking for new talent with a recently launched competition for illustrators and designers that offers $4,000 to the winner. they are also yet to launch a global smash hit game. snapscan where: south africa in a nutshell: make payments via your mobile phone what's unique: a service, not dissimilar to apple pay, which allows people to make payments with their mobile phone by simply taking a photo of a qr code and punching in the amount they want to pay. future moves: less than a year after launch, the system was being used by 12,000 small businesses. there is huge potential for this service: there is an appetite for convenience in payments and there is an opportunity to leverage on africa being mobile first. they have the potential to expand into other markets and maybe even compete with apple pay and google wallet. delivery science where: nigeria in a nutshell: delivering smarter using big data what's unique: this startup is all about using big data and analytics to help companies in africa's emerging e-commerce sector manage inventory and deliver more efficiently. delivery science offer to completely manage a company's logistics from what's in the warehouse to innovative ideas like verification codes for deliveries to ensure the right person gets a package. future moves: the company was started this year by a team who have successfully launched other startups and who are knowledgeable in delivery and logistics. they have the right idea and the knowledge to serve the market in nigeria. paysail where: ghana in a nutshell: out-of-the-box payroll management application. what's unique: right now, many companies in ghana still use spreadsheets to organize employee pay. paysail offers an all-in-one service that comes with ghanian tax codes programmed in to make company accountants' jobs easier. future moves: it's a new idea. it's different. most of the companies -- like this one -- that are incubated in the meltwater entrepreneurial school of technology in ghana try to reach other markets. right now, no one is doing anything like this in next-door nigeria, which means the paysail application has opportunity to offer an incredible change. andela where: nigeria, pan-africa in a nutshell: training graduates as developers, matching them with employers what's unique: andela is focused on helping employers from all over the world find talent from africa. they take it a step further by identifying raw talent and paying them to learn to become developers, then matching them with global employers looking for talent. the company currently has a local office in nigeria and a company in the united states. future moves: this company's approach is very smart. in africa there is a desperate need for talent -- we don't have enough developers, let alone quality developers, because universities don't qualify graduates in technologies for the future. there is also a huge market globally, so this company has a massive opportunity. brck where: kenya, all of africa. in a nutshell: a self-powered, mobile wifi device. what's unique: brck is a blackbox described by its makers as ""a backup generator for the internet,"" with the aim of solving africa's connectivity issues. in africa, there are power outages on a daily basis so getting online and staying online anywhere and anytime in these parts as well as other parts of the world requires a device that can seamlessly switch between multiple networks to provide access, even in remote areas. that's where brck comes in. future moves: this product is quite ingenious. the potential impact and scale of this company is the reason it closed a $1.2 million seed funding round, after initially raising $172,000 in a kickstarter campaign last year. brck has the potential to provide internet connectivity to rural areas across the world, where internet access can be unstable.","this year, african entrepreneurs built businesses that can solve the continent's problems"

"-- barack obama may be a risk averse president focused more on the middle class as his legacy than on the middle east. but isis' advances against irbil (where there are u.s. troops and diplomats) and its brutality against the yazidis and christians gave him no choice but to become more risk ready. but we should be under no illusion that targeted airstrikes against isis and humanitarian assistance to besieged minorities means a transformation in the president's views about iraq, a slippery slope to military intervention, or the beginning of a new save the middle east campaign. obama is likely to remain a very cautious, risk-averse president. and here's why. the 'extricator-in-chief' barack obama's own political legitimacy is intertwined with a commitment to withdraw u.s. forces from afghanistan and iraq, the two longest and among the most profitless wars in american history. this is both a campaign promise and one about which the president feels very strongly. he knows he can't fix iraq and if there is a red line in his world view that won't turn pink, it is his opposition to redeploying american forces back into iraq at any significant level. he is in this regard the extricator-in-chief determined to get the united states out of old wars and not into new ones. that, combined with obama's wariness about using military force in an open-ended conflict without clear purpose and his aversion to appearing to take the shia side, particularly one identified with nuri al-maliki, a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the vast majority of the iraqi public, should serve as a brake against an expansive mission creep. the libya precedent the president's risk aversion will be strengthened by the way things turned out in libya. there, in 2010, in an effort to prevent moammar gadhafi's forces from killing thousands of civilians in benghazi, the united states and france mobilized a coalition backed by the united nations, the arab league and nato. despite action by all these formidable forces, it took an eight-month effort by nato to facilitate the opposition's efforts to overthrow the libyan dictator. more important, today libya is a mess riven by tribal and regional rivalries. and to boot, for the first time since 1988, a u.s. ambassador was killed in a terrorist attack in benghazi. obama knows that there are clear limits to what he can do in iraq and that even a much more ambitious commitment will not produce results. on the contrary, it will lead to a trap in which the united states is likely to become ensnared. if you couldn't fix iraq in a decade of effort, $25 billion to support the iraqi military and a trillion dollars or more to prop up the iraqi government, you're not going to fix it now. 800+ days and counting governing is about choosing, particularly as a president watches the sands run through the hourglass in a second term. it may well be that obama's clock has run out with respect to new domestic initiatives. the really tough issues -- dealing with a grand bargain on tax increases and entitlement reform and climate change -- are probably beyond his capacity to realize. even immigration reform will likely be a bridge too far. he may well find himself suffering significant losses in the house and perhaps even the loss of the senate in the november 2014 midterms. obama could well complete his second term with his major accomplishments being realized in his first. that said, he has no intention of having his remaining less than 1,000 days be consumed with an iraq war he can't win or with a legacy that will be compared to his predecessor george w. bush, who took america into iraq in 2003. those prospects will virtually ensure a determined effort to keep the iraq venture limited. if possible, he will share with other nations the humanitarian dimension so the united states doesn't have to bear the sole responsibility. one thing is clear. while barack obama acted quickly this time around to protect americans and alleviate the suffering of threatened minority groups, he has no intention of becoming the lone ranger of iraq. not even george w. bush was prepared to do that. isis: a threat to the united states? last year, there were 17,891 global fatalities due to terrorism. of that number, 16 were americans. terrorism from isis or anyone else is not right now a strategic threat to the continental united states. it is to our allies, however, particularly in jordan. and it could become a threat to us, too. with millions of dollars, stolen passports and foreign fighters, isis could if it chose make a bid not just to strike at the so-called near enemy (jordan, iraq, saudi arabia) but at the far enemy, too (the united states). isis has its hands full at the moment. striking isis could well provide it with an added incentive to strike back at u.s. targets in the region and over time at america. isis' bold threat today that its flag will one day fly over the white house is sheer delusion. but it means that this vicious group could direct its attention at the united states. indeed, an attack against the united states or its assets in the region would clearly be the one trigger that could impel the president to do now what he clearly wants to avoid: launch a major military campaign to strike at isis in iraq and syria. what's the endgame? the biggest challenge for the president is that limited strikes against isis targets may protect americans, buck up the kurds, and perhaps defuse the current threat to the yazidi minority on the mountaintop. but they cannot put iraq back together again, save all persecuted minorities from isis brutality or help create a new political contract among iraqi kurds, muslims and shia. iraq is likely to continue to bleed and we can't stop that. the president was right to act and may well be called on to do so again. indeed, we can't rule out the possibility that he would send in more special forces. he can try to enlist other nations, work with america's regional allies, and push for internal reconciliation among iraqi politicians. but he's also right to be cautious and realistic about what he can really accomplish. we cannot save iraq from itself or from its neighbors, particularly iran, whose vision for iraq is much different than ours. this was a bridge too far when george w. bush tried to cross it in 2003. and it remains one to this day.","president obama orders u.s. military strikes in iraq, humanitarian assistance"
"news articles, social media posts and images about hong kong's pro-democracy protests are being heavily censored behind china notorious firewall. chinese state-run news outlets have largely ignored the pro-democracy protests except for the same xinhua story in which the hong kong chief executive cy leung denounced the demonstrations as ""unlawful."" leung: raw emotion 'will get us nowhere' in hong kong, residents have poured into the streets to defy beijing's vision for its political future in the midst of its longest series of political protests since the 1997 handover. their goal is to pressure china into giving the former british colony full universal suffrage. dozens have been reported injured by authorities. on the social media front, instagram has been blocked in china since sunday. users cannot view images and a message reads on the site: ""can't refresh feed."" china observers noted that while the app can't be accessed in china for most, the country's first lady peng liyuan's official instagram account posted a picture of her and her husband, china's president xi jinping, on monday. the photo app has been viewed as a relatively non-political social media platform, said king-wa fu, an assistant professor at the university of hong kong. ""in the past two days, we can see a lot of people holding phones and taking pictures of different (hong kong protest) scenes on instagram, facebook and sharing it around,"" he said. ""it's a huge amount of pictures posted in a short period of time."" that may have led to the blocking of the photo-sharing app, fu said. the chinese government maintains strict controls over what can be seen on the internet and social media. this firewall extends to facebook, twitter and youtube, and google is rarely accessible. hong kong does not fall under the same restrictions. china's massively popular microblogging site, sina weibo is being censored at the highest rate this year with ""hong kong"" as the most commonly deleted term, according to weiboscope, a hong kong university effort that monitors deleted posts. about 152 out of 10,000 weibo posts were blocked, said fu, who also works on weiboscope. why china censors hong kong demonstrations photos of police confronting young pro-democracy protesters are sensitive in china, because it's a reminder of tiananamen square, in which chinese authorities cracked down on student protesters on june 4, 1989, fu said. ""if you look at the political agenda of protests in hong kong, they have the same objectives. they're calling for democracy in hong kong and political reform. these are two main sensitive topics in china. this is the topic they don't want the chinese citizens to widely discuss,"" he said. but china cannot completely black out any knowledge of the hong kong protests, especially with 40 million mainland arrivals to the special administrative region every year. chinese authorities cannot control whether its citizens know about pro-democracy hong kong protests, but they can shut down ""autonomous communication space"" where public discussions can take place in china, said xiao qiang, an adjunct professor for the school of information at the university of california at berkeley. ""that's what they're trying to repress,"" he said. ""the chinese government fears that the kinds of protest and exercise of rights demanding greater political freedom will be contagious and trigger something in china,"" he said. ""that's what they fear the most."" what you can see in china the protest intensified sunday when hong kong police unleashed tear gas on demonstrators. but there was no mention of it on the evening chinese state-run cctv news. on monday morning, the homepage of china's major portals such as sina, sohu, 163 and china's state-run news agency xinhua did not mention the events either. searches on china's top search engine sites such as baidu and sogou for the terms ""hong kong protest"" or even ""hong kong students"" yielded irrelevant results such as stories showing a a blissful image of hong kong residents picnicking on the grass or how hong kong is welcoming tourists from the mainland during the national holiday week. when relevant results appeared on the chinese search engines, the articles contained a distinctively pro-china slant and even surfaced a month-old article about a small pro-beijing counter-protest in hong kong. content that was more sympathetic to hong kong protesters had been removed with messages reading: ""in accordance with relevant laws, regulations and policies, search results could not be displayed.""",china's news and social media are stripped of discussions on hong kong protests
"-- when tropical storm washi ripped through the southern philippine city of cagayan de oro last weekend, it dumped in one day more than the city's entire average rainfall for the month of december. according to the philippine atmospheric, geophysical and astronomical services administration, a total of 181 millimeters of rainfall was recorded in the area last friday, compared to the expected 99.9 millimeters for the whole month. the devastating flash floods, which have so far claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people, arrived just weeks after a report from the uk's met office hadley centre for climate change indicated that global warming has significantly increased the number of people at risk from flooding. the report, ""climate: observations, projections and impacts,"" examined how climate change will modify the weather in 24 countries around the world. while findings vary from region to region, it forecasts an overall increase this century of coastal and river floods, extreme weather events and a global temperature rise of between 3-5c, if emissions are left unchecked. according to climate change experts, cities from new york in the u.s. to dhaka in bangladesh are likely to be heavily affected. migration simon reddy, executive director of the c40 cities network, which promotes sustainable development among local city authorities around the world, says this could be a catalyst for migration into urban areas. ""if the forecast temperature rise is accurate, then entire countries could be irrevocably damaged in certain parts of the world -- and their inhabitants will have to find somewhere else to live,"" he said. to illustrate his point, reddy says that a third of flood-prone bangladesh, in south asia, could be made uninhabitable by a two-foot (60 cm) rise in regional sea-levels. the met office report echoes this point, predicting that climate change will subject an additional five million people in bangladesh to floods, if they continue to live in the same place. ""where are they going to go?"" asks reddy. ""in most cases they'll move to where the opportunities and the jobs are -- the nearest habitable city."" with 70% of the world's population expected to live in cities by 2050, according to figures from the u.n., the impact of climate change on the urban environment appears more pressing than ever before. floods historically, cities built up around water highways and coastal regions have flourished due to their association with maritime trade and transport, said jan corfee-morlot, senior climate change analyst for the oecd. ""this means that a disproportionately high number of the world's cities are located in areas that are now increasingly at risk of floods,"" she added. according to morlot, recent risk studies from the oecd as well as the newly published data from the met office report predict that extreme ""once-in-a-lifetime"" weather events such as flash floods and coastal hurricanes are going to become significantly more commonplace. but, she says, it's not just cities in the developing world that are ill-equipped to manage the problem. ""in america alone -- new york, miami, new orleans -- these cities face terrible exposure to floods, and unlike cities such as rotterdam (in the netherlands) -- they do not have the defenses to prevent them."" in the future, morlot believes that major cities will have to adapt to the reality of regular flooding by building new infrastructure, such as vast flood barriers and ""evacuation avenues"" -- wide roads with dedicated lanes for emergency vehicles. extreme heat global temperatures are projected to rise by between three to five degrees over the next century, according to the met office. dr david dodman, senior researcher at the international institute for environment and development, says that temperatures in the city will far exceed that, due to a phenomenon known as the ""urban heat island effect."" ""the built environment tends to absorb heat during the day and release it slowly at night, so there's little opportunity for the city to cool down"" he said. ""this means that temperature rises from climate change will be significantly exaggerated in urban areas."" aside from increased instances of heat-related deaths, particularly among the elderly population, dodman says that the ""wicked irony"" of the urban heat island effect is that it stimulates a demand for air conditioning. ""in places like delhi, we're seeing a growing middle class use their wealth to pay for electricity-hungry air-conditioning units, which contribute to global warming, and this of course creates a negative feedback loop."" water shortages according to dodman, the predicted rise in global sea levels pose a threat to city aquifers -- underground wells that provide a source of fresh water for many urban settlements around the world. ""in coastal cities, the rise causes 'saline intrusion' -- where salty water gets into the fresh water aquifers, making it undrinkable"" he says. in addition, dr doug crawford-brown, executive director at cambridge university's centre for climate mitigation research, anticipates that stock piles of bottled water will be have to be rationed when fresh water distribution systems buckle under the impact of city floods. ""even in a developed city like london, which is very well protected by the thames barrier, high intensity rainfall could create problems with the old sewage system -- causing the potential spread of microbial disease,"" he said. adaptation simon reddy believes that urbanities of the future will be defined ""not just by how they restrict their own contributions to climate change, but by the infrastructure and policies they employ to defend against the consequences of it."" to this end, reddy says that many of the cities in the c40 network have already started to implement adaptive measures. ""in seoul, for instance, they have removed a highway and restored an ancient river running through the city. this creates a wind corridor to it keep cool, and will also help drain water away in times of high rainfall,"" he said. meanwhile, new york and tokyo have led the way with green rooftops and urban gardens. ""urban green spaces are going to be more critical than (they have) ever been,"" he said. ""not only do they absorb heat and rainfall -- helping to keep cities cool and dry, but they provide opportunities for small scale food cultivation -- so city dwellers can become a little less dependent on imports."" for matthew kahn, economics professor at the ucla's environment institute, the accelerated urbanization caused by climate change, will mean that for most cities, the only way is up. the professor, whose book ""climatopolis"" details how future cities could turn climate change to their advantage, says that he expects future modern cities to accommodate the flood of migrants by building energy efficient high-rise residential tower blocks, over small areas of land -- ""much like we see in singapore today,"" he said.",tropical storm in philippines comes just after report on climate change predicts floods
"-- a norwegian woman who was sentenced to prison in dubai after reporting that she was raped has been given a pardon and will be heading home soon, she said monday. speaking to reporters in dubai, marte deborah dalelv seemed relieved and happy as she confirmed the news -- if still slightly bewildered by the swift turn of events. ""they told me that i would be pardoned and that they were going to give me my passport back, so i got it immediately,"" she said. asked what happens next, dalelv paused a moment before replying: ""i get to go home."" she added, ""we want to make it as soon as possible."" dalelv has her passport in her possession and filed the paperwork for an exit visa monday afternoon. she hopes to find out tuesday when she can leave the country. a spokeswoman for norway's foreign ministry, ragnhild imerslund, said dubai ruler sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum had said dalelv was free to travel where she wants and can remain in dubai if she chooses. the sheikh, who is vice president of the united arab emirates, also said the 24-year-old had not been and would not be deported, imerslund said. she is expected to travel in a day or two, the spokeswoman said. dalelv, a qatar-based interior designer, was on a work trip to dubai when she reported to police that she had been raped by a colleague at the hotel where she was staying. she was herself then detained and charged with having unlawful sex, making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol. a court last week sentenced her to 16 months in prison, prompting outrage in norway. dalelv's lawyer, mahmoud azab abu gareda, said the sheikh's pardon is ""effectively a royal decree,"" which wipes the slate clean, leaving no record of her conviction. this means the alleged perpetrator, who was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage, also walks free, he said. dalelv has dropped her case against him, so it will not be pursued further, he said. men convicted of raping swiss tourist in india 'fantastic feeling' dalelv said she had not known what to expect when she went into a meeting monday with the dubai attorney general, her lawyers and norway's ambassador to the united arab emirates, ase elin bjerke. ""i just went in with an open mind, and they said, 'well, we are pardoning you.' this is such a good day,"" dalelv said. ""now i get my exit visa, and then i am going home to see my mum!"" dalelv gave insight into the pressure she has been under, saying that she knew what had happened to her but that she had started to believe she was ""guilty emotionally."" she said it was a ""fantastic feeling"" to have her freedom back and be able to leave dubai, but at the same time she would miss the friends she has made. bjerke, norway's envoy, said that her country had been working on dalelv's behalf for several months and that she was very grateful for the decision to issue a pardon. bjerke said the case had resonated on social media in norway and elsewhere. ""i think people can see themselves in marte,"" she said. ""she has done what a lot of people would do when they come and visit dubai. you are out with your friends ,and things roll on that you are not in control of. she is happy now, and we are happy with her, and she can return free to norway."" norway has a ""very good"" relationship with the united arab emirates, bjerke said, adding that she credited the openness between the two nations for the outcome of this case. islamic laws, traditions norwegian foreign affairs minister espen barth eide also welcomed news of dalelv's pardon. ""marte is released! thanks to everyone who signed up to help #releasemarte,"" his twitter feed said. imerslund said ""very constructive"" dialogue between the foreign ministers of norway and the uae, along with international pressure and interest, led to this outcome in dalelv's case. on friday, eide had called his uae counterpart, sheikh abdullah bin zayed al nahyan, to protest dalelv's conviction as ""contrary to fundamental human rights,"" a weekend statement from the norwegian ministry said. while dubai has a reputation as a cosmopolitan city that boasts western influences, where visitors can drink at bars and restaurants and unmarried couples can share hotel rooms, the country adheres to islamic laws and traditions. having sex outside of marriage and public consumption of alcohol are both violations of the law in the united arab emirates. women's rights violations not just a developing nation issue fired from her job dalelv no longer has a job with the company that sent her on the work assignment to dubai. she said that a month after the rape, while forced to stay in dubai as the case wound through the legal system, she was fired by her employer, al mana interiors. a representative of al mana interiors, who declined to be publicly identified, said saturday that dalelv and the sudanese man she accused -- who is married with three children -- were both terminated by al mana interiors for ""drinking alcohol at a staff conference that resulted in trouble with the police."" a statement released later the same day by al mana interiors spokesman hani el korek said that the company was sympathetic toward dalelv ""during this very difficult situation"" and that her dismissal was not because of the rape claim. the statement said that company representatives were by her side through the initial investigation, spending ""days at both the police station and the prosecutor's office to help win her release."" ""only when ms. dalelv declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status, and ceased communication with her employer, was the company forced to end our relationship with her,"" the statement said. ""the decision had nothing to do with the rape allegation, and unfortunately neither ms. dalelv nor her attorneys have chosen to contact the company to discuss her employment status."" the company is owned by qatari billionaire wissam al mana, who made headlines this year after it was revealed that he secretly married singer janet jackson in 2012. raped on the job in america's fields rights record criticized the united arab emirates has been heavily criticized by rights groups that say it condones sexual violence against women. human rights watch has called its record ""shameful,"" saying it must change the way it handles such cases. in december 2012, a british woman reported being raped by three men in dubai. she was found guilty of drinking alcohol without a license and fined. in january 2010, a british woman told authorities she was raped by an employee at a dubai hotel. she was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage. an australian woman reported in 2008 that she was drugged and gang-raped. she was convicted of having sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol, and she was sentenced to 11 months in prison. amanpour: what's next for women's rights in the middle east? cnn's nicola goulding reported from dubai and jennifer deaton in atlanta; laura smith-spark wrote in london. cnn's phil o'sullivan, dareen al omari and nima elbagir contributed to this report.","new: marte dalelv says it is a ""fantastic feeling"" to have her freedom back"
"-- when nadya suleman gave birth to octuplets in january 2009 the news was greeted with amazement around the world. but astonishment soon gave way to criticism directed at her -- it was revealed that she was already a mother to six children -- and over the ethics of fertility treatment. so far she has weathered the storm and soon her eight babies will be celebrating their first birthday. but how on earth does she cope? ""the children sleep all night,"" she told cnn's max foster. ""they sleep maybe from 7.30pm to 5am, but there are not enough hours in the day."" caring for octuplets -- six boys and two girls -- poses a unique economic challenge for the 34-year-old mother of 14 who has also been criticized for being jobless. ""it's a challenge. it's a double-edged sword. i'm damned if i work and i'm damned if i don't. i can't work a nine-to-five job because that's not going to be enough income to support the kids. i'm trying to secure what i can."" suleman says trying to manage the domestic budget is like ""a revolving door of expenses. every dollar that comes in goes on the kids."" ""octomom"" -- as she has been dubbed by the media -- does have some help with the child-rearing from three helpers, one of which is dedicated to looking after her child who has autism. inevitably, it is impossible for her to give each child the attention they deserve. ""it would be impossible for a couple. you just try and do the best you can. you try and have special time with each child -- putting them to bed, telling them a story, asking them about their day -- as long as they get alone time and it's quality. i'd love to give them quantity but that's virtually impossible."" despite her experience with fertility treatment suleman is reluctant for across the board limits on the number of embryos that can be implanted during ivf treatment. ""every case is subjective, every woman responds differently,"" suleman said. ""given my past reproductive history my doctor didn't make any kind of mistake, he was guided by what was successful in the past. so only a certain amount of embryos were transferred -- the same amount when i had my twins. the last thing anyone imagined was more than one or two growing."" although the burden of raising 14 children is obvious, suleman is reluctant to jump into a relationship. she isn't in a rush to find a male role model for her children. ""i believe i do not have to put myself out there. i do not have to date. i feel the missing piece of the puzzle will be placed naturally when the time is right. i don't see the point in going out and wasting precious time and energy that i need for my kids."" suleman is currently documenting the experiences of the past year in a book and despite the constant sniping from the media she still manages to reflect positively on the past 12 months. i've definitely grown more in the past eleven months than i have in the past 34 years. i personally believe everything happens for a reason and i've learnt how strong i am. it's a choice who you let into your life and who you are going to allow to affect you psychologically or emotionally. i've learned how to maintain boundaries and how to grow as a result of some extraordinarily challenging situations.""","nadya suleman, mother of ocpuplets speaks to cnn about her amazing year"

"-- one endless june afternoon a decade ago, i drove along southern iceland's highway one, past the weak spot in the planetary crust whose rupture recently brought air traffic in europe to an ashen standstill. it was summer solstice, a day when the sun lolled at the horizon but never set, turning to crimson the basalt cliffs that face the atlantic. from countless crags along their length gushed great arcs of water, pressured from above by a weight draped over a hundred square kilometers like a huge slab of white cake frosting: the 200-meter-thick eyjafjallajokull glacier. between the coastal cliffs and the ice lay a band of green slopes, five kilometers wide, interspersed with fjords and valleys that held clusters of farmhouses and barns with red metal roofs, their shining silos and occasional church steeples pointed toward the immense glacier hovering overhead. the air, brilliantly clear, resounded with terns, orange-billed oystercatchers, petrels, whimbrels and musical wagtails. at 8 in the evening, farmers in overalls were still out haying, their pale hair aflame in the suspended daylight. i saw a string of 10 riders on buckskin and dun mounts, forelegs lifted in the extra-high gait unique to icelandic horses, making them appear to be swimming through the deep green ribbon at the glacier's edge. that extended, gilded moment was as perfect a definition of beauty on earth as i have known. it remains indelible, even though over the past week, much of what i saw was swept away as eyjafjallajokull's erupting volcano melted a gaping hole in its ice cap, flooding what lay below. a big clue as to why that happened can be found an hour's drive to the west, halfway between eyjafjallajokull and iceland's capital, reykjavik, in a broad valley with a sharp cleft down its middle. that place, thingvellir, is so famous in icelandic history that practically no signs announce it, because everyone knows what and where it is. in a.d. 930, more than a thousand years after the decline of ancient greece, thingvellir was where western democracy was reborn. by coincidence -- or maybe not -- the spot where the norsk settlers who made up the island's infant society chose to convene their first parliament is one of the few places on the earth's surface where the geologic action that defines our planet's land and seas is visible. here, astride the mid-atlantic ridge, the north american and eurasian plates pull away from each other. perhaps 20 million years ago, this wrenching forced an upwelling of hot rock to rise through the ocean, and iceland was formed. thingvellir's rift valley floor is scored with cracks and fissures; at one point, a lava escarpment that is the eastern edge of north america towers 30 meters higher than the western edge of europe. the continents are currently recoiling from each other at a clip of two centimeters per year, a process that daily releases clouds of geothermic steam and sends geysers skyward -- and, sometimes, molten magma and volcanic ash. of course, the farmers who gathered in this shattered young landscape more than a millennium ago to lay down terms for civilization had no inkling that to the west lay an entire new world, where their democratic example would one day be magnified until it forged the philosophical basis for the most powerful country the planet has ever seen. both iceland and the united states exalt democracy as a social achievement worthy of lasting an eternity. yet the latter's unprecedented strength has derived not just from enlightened government, but from the release of its own hot clouds: exhaust from its vast industries, fleets and mechanized agriculture. as we have learned, these gases form an invisible barrier that, like a greenhouse's glass ceiling, keeps reflected heat of the sun from escaping our atmosphere. the denser that gaseous barrier grows, the hotter things get and the faster glaciers melt. as they flow off the land, we are warned, seas rise. yet something else is lately worrying geologists: the likelihood that the earth's crust, relieved of so much formidable weight of ice borne for many thousands of years, has begun to stretch and rebound. as it does, a volcano awakens in iceland (with another, larger and adjacent to still-erupting eyjafjallajokull, threatening to detonate next). the earth shudders in haiti. then chile. then western china. mexicali-calexico. the solomon islands. spain. new guinea. and those are just the big ones, 6+ on the richter scale, and just in 2010. and it's only april. it's looking like this may be a long decade. and if we don't pull carbon out of the way we energize our lives soon, a small clump of our not-too-distant surviving descendants may find themselves, as gaia scientist james lovelock has direly predicted, like the first icelanders: gathered on some near-barren hunk of rock near one of the still-habitable poles, trying yet anew to eke out a plan for human civilization. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of alan weisman.","iceland has great volcanic activity, is where european and north american continents meet"

"-- a high school senior's lawsuit against her mother and father for financial support and college tuition hit a hurdle tuesday when a new jersey judge denied the teenager's request for immediate financial assistance from the parents. rachel canning, 18, alleges in her lawsuit that her parents forced her out of their lincoln park, new jersey home, and that she is unable to support herself financially. the lawsuit asks that her parents pay the remaining tuition for her last semester at her private high school, pay her current living and transportation expenses, commit to paying her college tuition and pay her legal fees for the suit she filed against her parents. her parents say she left home because she didn't want to obey their rules. judge peter bogaard denied the request for high school tuition and current living expenses at a hearing tuesday in new jersey state superior court. another hearing will be held in april on other issues in the suit, including whether canning left home of her own accord, the judge said. canning, an honor student and cheerleader at morris catholic high school in denville, says in court documents she had to leave her parents' home because of emotional and psychological mistreatment, alleging, among other things, that her mother called her ""fat"" and ""porky"" and that her father threatened to beat her. ""i have been subjected to severe verbal and physical abuse by my mother and father,"" canning wrote in a court certification. ""i am not willingly and voluntarily leaving a reasonable situation at home to make my own decisions. i had to leave to end the abuse."" canning left her parents' home at the end of last october. after spending two nights at her boyfriend's home, she moved into the home of her friend in a nearby town, where she has been staying ever since, according to court documents written by the parents' attorney. fair or outrageous? new jersey teen sues her parents to pay up for college canning seeks a court's official declaration that she is unemancipated, meaning her parents would still be required to support her financially. she also is suing to reimburse her friend's parents, john and amy inglesino, for legal fees that they have been paying since the lawsuit was initiated, according to the suit. canning's parents, sean and elizabeth canning, claim that allegations of abuse are completely unfounded. ""we were always her support team, cheering her on or defending her whenever she had a problem,"" wrote elizabeth canning in a court certification. she claims that her daughter was never forced out of the family's home, but rather ""took it upon herself to run away so that she could live her life without any parental supervision and without any rules."" canning was suspended from school for truancy last october, according to court documents filed by her parents' attorney, laurie rush-masuret. her parents told the teen that she could no longer see her boyfriend, who was also suspended from school. car and phone privileges were also taken away. once she learned of the punishment, canning cut school again and then decided to run away, her father said in court documents. once she left home, her parents notified morris catholic high school that they would no longer pay for their daughter's tuition, the documents state. ""they stopped paying my high school tuition to punish the school and me, and have redirected my college fund indicating their refusal to afford me an education,"" rachel canning stated in court documents. the situation around the teen and her family initiated an investigation by new jersey's division of child protection and permanency (dcpp), which received allegations that rachel was being abused. the teen wrote in court documents that her school contacted the state agency. when dcpp staffers interviewed the teen, her parents, and her two younger sisters, they ultimately ""determined that allegation of emotional abuse was unfounded,"" a letter from dcpp states. sean canning, a retired lincoln park police chief and current business administrator for the town of mount olive, told cnn affiliate wcbs that he and his wife are ""distraught."" ""we're being sued by our child. i'm dumbfounded. so is my wife. so are my other daughters,"" he said. ""living in our house, there's very few things. there's minor chores, there's curfews. when i say curfew, it's usually after 11 o'clock at night."" sean canning wrote in court documents that the inglesinos, for taking in his daughter, had ""enabled the situation to an absurd level. under the guise of good intentions, they have arrogantly placed themselves in our stead and operated under the belief that their parenting style is superior to our own."" cnn's attempts to reach john or amy inglesino were unsuccessful. stephanie frangos hagan, a family law attorney and new jersey state bar association family law officer, said to her knowledge, a case like this is unprecedented. though canning is 18 years old, new jersey law does not consider a person to be emancipated unless that person has left ""the scope of his or her parents' authority,"" according to hagan. ""a parent is not obligated to contribute to the support of an emancipated child,"" said hagan. ""a child is emancipated when he or she is beyond the control of the parents. is she truly beyond the scope of her parents' authority, as a result of her own voluntary acts? that's for the judge to decide."" ""the argument (she) is making is that she didn't leave home voluntary. she's saying 'i was thrown out,'"" hagan said. neither rachel canning nor her parents testified at tuesday's hearing, but it saw a reunion between the daughter and her estranged parents, the first one in over four months. while sean canning was seen speaking to rachel, elizabeth was seen briefly weeping after being seated. the parents' attorney, rush-masuret, told cnn that elizabeth canning is too upset about the situation to even talk about it. she said the cannings have told their daughter to come home, and she has refused. ""to be clear, my clients never abandoned nor abused their child and they have asked her to come home. they simply sought to exert their own parental judgment and reasonable household rules which she is not willing to accept,"" rush-masuret said in court tuesday. rachel canning's attorney, tanya n. helfand, said sean and elizabeth canning are being ""negligent and irresponsible."" ""normal healthy parents want to help their children. they want their children to go to college. they want to help them with their difficulties,"" helfand said in court. ""you may not get along wonderfully every single day with your teenager. that doesn't mean that you abandon them and you say, 'guess what, you're on your own.'"" judge bogaard denied the request for the last semester of high school tuition because the school said she could continue anyway, since she is an honor student. and rachel canning wrote in her court certification that ""the peer ministers at morris catholic have decided to raise funds to pay ... tuition so i don't have to leave early."" as for why he denied the request for immediate financial assistance, the judge indicated he didn't see an emergency situation, and would make further decisions at the next hearing. the teen wrote in her court certification that she aspires to be a biomedical engineer. her first choice for college is the university of delaware, from which she has yet to hear back from regarding her admission decision. she said taking legal action was necessary to ensure that she is able to accomplish her future goals. ""i am a very good student. i have no drug problems. i am a good athlete. i work at a job outside of school,"" she wrote. ""my parents simply will not help me any longer...(they) should be required to provide for my support and education until i can stand on my own two feet. in order to do this, i had to take legal action."" girl costs father $80,000 with 'suck it' facebook post cnn's ronni berke, jean casarez, lauren-ashley morton and tekella foster contributed to this report.","rachel canning, 18, is suing her parents for financial support, legal fees, tuition"
"-- thousands of people were evacuated from the coast of southern spain on friday as a wildfire menaced the wealthy resort town of marbella, local authorities said. about 4,000 people were evacuated from the village of ojen and an additional 2,000 people from the eastern part of marbella, said maria jose figueira, a spokeswoman for marbella's government. the fire has been brought under control in marbella but continues to rage out of control north of marbella near ojen and coin, figueira said. at least one person is feared dead after a charred body, thought to be that of an elderly man, was found in ojen, she told cnn. an injured german couple has been admitted to the carlos haya hospital in malaga, she added. the wildfire started thursday in coin, to the north of marbella, figueira said. it was at its most intense at noon friday near the villages of ojen, coin and monda, spain's efe news agency reported. a racetrack in marbella and a sports center in the monda area have been set up as shelters for those forced to leave their homes, the news agency said. however, those previously ordered to leave their homes in marbella can now return, figueira said. the costa del sol, in spain's andalucia region, is popular with visitors for its mediterranean beaches and sunshine, and is home to large numbers of expatriates, particularly from britain. the uk foreign office said it was working with spanish authorities.

"-- i want to translate the web into every major language: every webpage, every video, and, yes, even justin bieber's tweets. with its content split up into hundreds of languages -- and with over 50% of it in english -- most of the web is inaccessible to most people in the world. this problem is pressing, now more than ever, with millions of people from china, russia, latin america and other quickly developing regions entering the web. in this ted talk, i introduce my new project, called duolingo, which aims at breaking the language barrier, and thus making the web truly ""world wide."" we have all seen how systems such as google translate are improving every day at translating the gist of things written in other languages. unfortunately, they are not yet accurate enough for my purpose: even when what they spit out is intelligible, it's so badly written that i can't read more than a few lines before getting a headache. this is why you don't see machine-translated articles on cnn. with duolingo, our goal is to encourage people, like you and me, to translate the web into their native languages. now, with billions and billions of pages on the web, this can't be done with just a few volunteers, nor can we afford to pay professional translators. when severin hacker and i started duolingo, we realized we needed a way to entice millions of people to help translate the web. however, coordinating millions of contributors to translate language presents two major hurdles. first, finding enough people who are bilingual enough to help with translation is difficult. second, motivating them to do it for free makes this next to impossible. the idea behind duolingo is to kill two birds with one stone by solving both of these problems simultaneously. we accomplish this by transforming language translation into something that anyone can do -- not just bilinguals -- and that millions of people want to do: learning a foreign language. it is estimated that over one billion people worldwide are learning a foreign language, with millions doing so using computer programs. with duolingo, people learn a foreign language while simultaneously translating text. when you learn on duolingo, the website gives you exercises tailored specifically to you that teach you every aspect of the new language. you may be asked to translate a sentence, to pronounce or listen to a phrase, or to describe what you see in an image. some of the sentences you translate come from real websites. by having multiple students translate each sentence, and then choosing the best one, duolingo produces translations that are as accurate as those from professional language translators. because you create valuable translations as a side effect, learning on duolingo is 100% free: no ads, no hidden fees, no subscriptions. duolingo entails a new business model that allows anyone online, regardless of socioeconomic status, to have access to education. for example, the leading language-learning software sells for over $500, which is beyond the means of the majority of the world's population. if language education is offered free of charge in exchange for students' performing useful tasks, those who cannot afford to pay with money pay with their time -- time that would have been spent learning anyway. this is how i want to translate the web. now go on and sign up for duolingo. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of luis von ahn.",luis von ahn founded the company behind captcha
"-- french and malian forces squaring off with islamist militants seized a key city from them friday, a high-ranking french source told cnn. the city is konna, in the central region of mali, a sprawling, landlocked saharan nation. that region is the latest front in the grinding fight between the west and al qaeda-linked militants. read more: opinion: why africa backs french in mali the development is an important advance a week after france launched an air and ground military offensive against a strong militant presence across northern mali and other locations in the sprawling country. insurgents advancing south toward the capital, bamako, took konna on january 10. they started retreating a week ago after the french and malian forces pushed back, with attacks from the air and other firepower. read more: france continues mali airstrikes; residents frantic the fighting in mali has captured the world's attention. it was one of the most successful democracies in africa until last year, when a coup toppled the president and islamists capitalized on the chaos by establishing themselves in the north. read more: six reasons events in mali matter there, they imposed a strict interpretation of sharia law, banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. they also damaged historic tombs and shrines. france, once the colonial power in mali, unleashed an offensive against the militants last week, a mission that president francois hollande says is designed to ""destroy"" the terrorist groups that have taken root. french envoy stresses urgency france is sending troops to mali from military facilities in africa and from france. paris is seeking help from its regional allies and the international community. such assistance has its perils. after algeria permitted france to use its airspace to take on insurgents, militants angry about the move stormed a gas field in eastern algeria and took hostages in what is now an ongoing hostage crisis. french ambassador to mali christian rouyer reiterated the need for the french offensive. ""we had a friendly country that was on the verge of dying,"" he told cnn in an interview friday. ""it was absolutely necessary to act with urgency. we did it, i believe, with full knowledge of the reasons. faced with the seriousness of the situation, to my knowledge, there was no other solution."" french military power has been boosted, he said, ""because we know we have an adversary who's determined, who's not afraid, knows the terrain well and who's well-equipped."" the offensive has made an impact, stopping the ""terrorist advance"" and saving other towns: mopti and sevare, for example, rouyer said. ""the advance of terrorist forces -- either in the western or eastern sectors -- has stopped,"" he said, adding that this is helping to establish calm in bamako.

""we have deployed 100-ish, about 100 trainers to africa. they're traveling to niger, nigeria, burkina faso, senegal, togo and ghana to discuss training and equipping and deployment needs of those countries in the interest of getting them ready to go into mali,"" she said. u.n. says warring threatens cultural heritage the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization has issued calls for the protection of cultural heritage sites in mali. the ancient city of timbuktu is a unesco world heritage site of huge cultural significance, but its carefully preserved heritage has come under severe threat amid the ongoing conflict. the fabled city, whose name is sometimes used in the west as a synonym for a faraway place, was at the center of trans-sahara trade in earlier times. last year, al qaeda-linked rebels in northern mali destroyed historic and religious landmarks there, claiming such relics are idolatrous. now it is threatened by warfare. ""i ask all armed forces to make every effort to protect the cultural heritage of the country, which has already been severely damaged,"" unesco director-general irina bokova said in an appeal to all combatants. ""mali's cultural heritage is a jewel whose protection is important for the whole of humanity. this is our common heritage, nothing can justify damaging it."" refugees flee the u.n. refugee agency said that in treks that began last year, when the crisis started, malians are fleeing to other nations, including burkina faso, mauritania, niger, guinea, algeria and togo, and many are internally displaced. refugees in burkina faso said ""they fled the recent military intervention, the lack of any means of subsistence, and fear of the strict application of sharia law,"" the agency said. people talked about family members disappearing. ""they reported having witnessed executions and amputations, and mentioned that large amounts of money are being offered to civilians to fight against the malian army and its supporters. according to the accounts from refugees there are children among the rebel fighters,"" the united nations said. ethnic tuareg women and children are among the latest refugees. ""they said that more people, including their husbands and fathers, are on their way to burkina faso by foot, many using donkeys or local transport, and many bringing livestock with them. despite ongoing insecurity in northern mali in recent months, they say that people have delayed fleeing mali to allow the men to take care of businesses and animals,"" the united nations said. human rights abuses the united nations has noted accounts of amputations, floggings and public executions, such as the july stoning of a couple that reportedly had an affair. the international criminal court has launched a war crimes investigation amid reports that residents have been mutilated and killed for disobeying the islamists.

"waistlines drop, hemlines rise, but the domestic drama never wavers. and there's an outfit for everything. that's the case at downton abbey, the fictional estate at the center of the hit british period drama. costumes from the show have been transported across the pond to one of america's great houses, where visitors can compare and contrast the lifestyles of the very rich in britain and america. the exhibition ""costumes of downton abbey"" opens march 1 at winterthur, the historic delaware estate where american industrialist henry francis du pont lived and entertained lavishly in the early part of the 20th century. ""winterthur was run kind of like a great resort hotel in its heyday. there were 34 indoor servants, and that was really to take care of mr. and mrs. du pont, their two daughters and their house guests when they came to visit,"" said jeff groff, director of public programs at winterthur and one of the exhibit's curators. the ""downton"" exhibit features 40 costumes worn upstairs and downstairs by the fictional earl of grantham, robert crawley, his family and their staff of servants. the costumes are on loan from cosprop, a prominent costumier for film, theater and television. the ""downton abbey"" series has moved from its start in 1912 into the jazz age of the 1920s, and the exquisite costumes have evolved with the times. in women's dresses, ""what we're really seeing through the seasons is the waistline dropping and the hem beginning to rise,"" groff said. the shape of women's wear also changes, with sinuous form-flattering silhouettes giving way to less structured clothing. 'downton' in america: 6 big estates ""by the 1920s, you've got all of these loose-hanging, very short dresses,"" said linda eaton, winterthur's director of collections and senior curator of textiles. ""fashion history is following right along with cultural history in terms of votes for women, women working outside of the home, women needing the ability for movement, losing their corsets, more natural silhouettes, less underclothing,"" eaton said. men's clothing changes far less on the show, groff said. tweeds worn at the time are still popular today in different cuts. lord grantham and his gentlemen contemporaries wore tweed suits around their country estates in the daytime. they would not, however, have worn tweeds to town. ""there was kind of a catchphrase at the time of 'no brown in town,'"" groff said. things had loosened up a bit by the 1920s and ""downton's"" season four, which just concluded for u.s. television audiences. black tie was becoming an alternative -- in certain less formal circumstances -- to white tie and tails in the evening. the exhibit contrasts country house life in britain and the united states using fictional downton and real-life winterthur. the differences? for one, americans have long loved their technology. ""americans love the history and style of britain and the sporting life and kind of the gentleman's lifestyle, but americans were completely devoted to the latest technology, modern conveniences and comfortable living."" 8 elegant u.s. mansion hotels winterthur had its own telephone system with 95 exchanges by the time it was overhauled by henry francis du pont in the early 1930s. it also had central heating and 23 bathrooms. in ""downton abbey,"" anxiety accompanies the arrival of technological advances for many of the characters. bringing the latest technology to american estates was easier, eaton said, because homes were newer and successive generations were likely to regularly renovate to put their own stamp on the home. america's melting pot was also evident at winterthur when the du pont family was in residence, with a swedish valet and a french ladies maid among many nationalities represented in the household. ""the diversity of nationalities who work in these great houses really reflects the diversity of nationalities who were coming to america,"" groff said. in britain, servants had more direct ties to local villages and tenant farms. what newly wealthy americans lacked in centuries-old tradition, they made up for in money. ""by the late 19th century the americans were the ones with all the money,"" said eaton. ""downton abbey"" illustrates that wealth through lord grantham's american wife cora, whose fortune has kept the estate from ruin, and her mother -- who occasionally sails in from new york sporting the very latest fashions. ""wealthy americans were not at all behind,"" eaton said. ""they traveled, they frequented all of the best couture designers in both london and paris."" yet the american fascination with all things british is still very much alive and well. the exhibition is on view at winterthur through january 2015. the museum recommends advance purchase of the timed tickets. entry to the exhibit is included in general admission, which is $20 for adults.","exhibit of ""downton abbey"" costumes opening in delaware"

"-- the ""west"" and the majority of the muslim world appear to have divergent views on two things about the syrian civil war: the centrality of the conflict and what constitutes the ""worst case scenario."" for the west, the prospect of al qaeda or other islamist militants prevailing is a nightmare. but for many sunni muslims, the nightmare is already here. two years ago, i cautioned that given syria's religious, sectarian and ethnic cleavages, and the minority alawite regime's preference for brutally suppressing the majority sunni population rather than placating it by accommodating its arab spring-inspired demands for reform, the turmoil there could morph into a protracted war pitting a ruthless dictator against an armed insurrection that could be usurped by islamist militants. that scenario come to fruition -- but that's not all. the war in syria has divided the arab world, inflamed sectarianism across the muslim world, revived al qaeda and even turned into a juncture where the west and the islamic world went in seemingly opposite directions. unless the international community recognizes the repercussions of this conflict and makes ending it its top priority, these fissures will continue to deepen, leaving many relationships in tatters and the international institutions mandated to maintain peace looking ineffectual. faced with such a grim reality, the wide spectrum of players involved in the conflict will continue to resort to violence and to view the conflict through a zero-sum framework that will only add to the suffering of the beleaguered people of syria. more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, which has turned millions more into refugees. assad's forces have had the temerity to capture their atrocities on camera, and these hours of gut-wrenching footage have proved a treasure-trove for al qaeda and other islamist militants. they have capitalized on assad's brutality to construct a jihadist narrative that, unlike other places where islamist militants had tried to establish a foothold, has resonated with many muslims around the world. the onslaught against the sunni majority turned syria into the favorite destination of militant islamists worldwide. it has provided al qaeda, which boasts not one but two affiliates there -- the islamic state of iraq and al-sham (isis) and the al nusra front -- an opportunity to rebrand itself and given its recruitment efforts a shot in the arm. while estimates vary, analysts agree that thousands of muslims from places as varied as kuwait, chechnya, morocco, belgium, pakistan, saudi arabia, france, and even the u.s. have traveled to join the fighting in syria, and the inflow is continuing. other individuals have donated thousands of dollars to support the armed opposition which, by all accounts, is slowly becoming dominated by islamists of varying degrees of militancy. as the secular free syrian army (fsa) continues to be plagued by internal divisions, it is the islamists who are taking the fight to assad. some, especially the al qaeda affiliates, have even attacked the fsa and driven them out of areas they fought long and hard to control. while regional players like iran, turkey, saudi arabia, qatar, iraq and hezbollah appear to be treating the conflict as a defining moment in the history of the region that could determine its political trajectory for years, the west, with the us at its helm, seems to be losing interest. even more worrisome for many in the middle east, recent reports in the american media suggest u.s. officials are increasingly viewing the prospect of islamist militants displacing assad or controlling large swathes of syrian territory as a ""nightmarish"" outcome. continuing carnage but for many of the roughly 1.3 billion muslims around the world, especially the majority sunnis -- estimated to be around 85% -- exactly who ousts assad is immaterial. if it is the islamists, or even the terrorists of al qaeda, then so be it. to them, the nightmare is what's happening now; practically nothing could be worse. last week, 72 prominent saudi clerics issued a statement calling on muslims around the world to support a recently formed islamist coalition in syria known as the ""islamic front."" the good news is that the front does not include the two al qaeda affiliates, and the clerics did not call on muslims to travel to syria. however, the characterization of the conflict as a ""jihad,"" or holy war, is a troubling development, given that the saudi government prohibited its imams from delivering politically-charged sermons and that its highest religious authority issued an edict enjoining saudis not to go to syria, and that doing so would contravene the religious sanctions of jihad. while it's not surprising that the war is proving irresistible to hardened militants who have fought in iraq, afghanistan and elsewhere, it is disconcerting that it is also attracting recent converts to islam from the west, underage boys who are traveling without their families' knowledge and even some women: the case of a saudi woman who announced her triumphant arrival in syria on twitter last week sheds light on the powerful gravitation force of syria amongst the religiously devout. but it is not only the devout or the militant who are heeding the call. in one video, a militant saudi who joined the fighting in syria holds back tears as he proudly boasts that he has encountered ""mujahideen"" there who confided in him that they did not know how to pray. in the minds of some sunni muslims around the world, the trepidation that the west is voicing over the prospect of al qaeda or other militant islamists coming to power in syria and the implications of such a scenario for religious and ethnic minorities is read as tacit acquiescence to what they see as a ""genocide"" -- a term the usually-reserved saudi foreign minister has been using lately -- against their sunni brethren. to them, the west is saying ""better the sunnis than the minority christians, alawites, shia and druze."" this perception has already led to a serious rift between saudi arabia -- the leader of the sunni world -- and the u.s. in a strongly-worded statement explaining why it was declining a coveted two-year seat on the united nations security council a few weeks ago, saudi arabia cited the continuing carnage in syria as one of the main reasons why it felt the international body was not fulfilling its mandate. it also accused the world of standing ""idly"" by. these two divergent assessments must be reconciled. the truth is that assad and al qaeda are two ugly faces of the same coin. the sooner the international community realizes that, the sooner the only viable option becomes clear: both of them have to go. read more: polio threat stalks syrian refugees in lebanon read more: u.n. confirms use of chemical weapons in syria read more: islamic front deals blow to syria's rebel alliance the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of fahad nazer.",prospect of al qaeda or other militants prevailing in syria is a nightmare for west
"-- a young male pulled a handgun friday afternoon inside a philadelphia high school gymnasium, firing and hitting two fellow students, police said. the injured boy and girl, each 15, were transported in stable condition after being shot in the arm just before 3:30 p.m., philadelphia police lt. john stanford said. the students were among about seven in the delaware valley charter high school gym at that time -- some playing basketball, others in one corner -- according to city police commissioner charles ramsey. ""the suspect is part of that group,"" ramsey said. both victims appeared to have been struck once inside the gym of delaware valley charter high school, said stanford. ramsey said that authorities didn't know yet if they were struck by the same bullet or more than one, noting that no shell was found at the scene. he described their wounds as non-life threatening. the school went into lockdown as law enforcement officers cleared it and hunted for the suspect, who had left the building, according to stanford. the police lieutenant said students were searched and then let out of the school. he also said surveillance video had captured the incident. a short time later, philadelphia police tweeted they had a suspect in custody. officer jillian russell, a police spokeswoman, said he was 17 years old. ramsey later said authorities were able to ""identify him right away,"" after which officers were sent to his home. ""we were able to grab him,"" the police commissioner said. ""we did not recover the gun, but we do have him in custody and he has been positively identified."" but a few hours later, stanford said that young man was not the shooter as police initially thought, though he was at the scene. he was ""completely cleared by investigators and released"" later that night, the police lieutenant said. by then, philadelphia police had announced they were ""still looking for additional suspects."" this includes searching for a weapon possibly used in the shooting in trash cans, along the tracks and other spots around the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority's olney station, septa spokesman andrew busch said. while a gun hadn't been found by 9 p.m., stanford said one of the two young males authorities had been looking for had turned himself in. a third male wanted by police had been expected to do the same but had not turned himself in as of 10:45 p.m., added the police spokesman. all three youths are delaware valley charter high school students. it is not clear if any of them are, in fact, the shooter. no one had been charged as of friday night. asked about what might have prompted the shooting, ramsey said, ""we don't know the motives -- don't know if it was an accident, don't know if it was intentional."" located in the olney section of philadelphia, delaware valley charter high school is open to any student who lives in the city. in its 2011 annual report to the state department of education, the school noted that it moved into its new facility in june 2006 and reported significant growth in reading and math test scores in recent years. friday's incident was at least the second shooting at or near a school this week. in new mexico on tuesday, a 12-year-old student with a sawed off, 20-gauge pump shotgun opened fire in a crowded gymnasium at berrendo middle school, according to authorities. two students were seriously injured and the shooter was in custody. ramsey, the philadelphia police commissioner, acknowledged that such shootings are ""happening across our country all too often, and it's just got to stop.""

"-- if you're looking for a harbinger of the zombie apocalypse, look no further than all those people on the street pecking at their tiny, handheld windows into a private world. so say a good portion of the commenters reacting to a semi-satirical article by comedian-columnist dean obeidallah, who noted the difficulty he had spending a day without a cell phone. it had become something bordering an addiction, he said, or at least a strong habit. some readers were taken aback. ""the boy needs to get a life,"" said commenter realworldaddict, who also wrote, ""hint to him and all the rest of the people walking around like zombies watching for messages on their cellphones: wake up and pay attention to the world around you. nobody is trying to contact you 24/7, and did you really want to know that one of your 568 'friends' on facebook just got a new goldfish?"" perhaps we're all shambling through daily life. when obewansnow mentioned a desire to keep a cell phone because it serves as a ""safety crutch,"" the discussion turned to self-sufficiency and even dystopian scenarios. ""when the apocalypse hits in december, you will be one of the first ones to go,"" replied a commenter. ""you have become too reliant on technology. you are afraid of breaking down and not having aaa to save you. you better toughen up and learn to work on your own car, or you will perish very quickly."" maybe they're taking a page from stephen king's novel, ""cell,"" in which the protagonist, clayton riddell, doesn't turn into a zombie because he doesn't own a cell phone. the story is about an event called ""the pulse"" that turns cell phone users into vicious, mindless beings. the ill effects of omnipresent communication are a common motif in science fiction. despite the anxiety, mobile devices are big business. apple has recently sold millions of its iphone 5 devices, and there are many people who believe that smartphones and tablets can almost give us superhuman abilities. but their omnipresence in daily life has not been without controversy, raising concerns that our lives will be forever changed by this technology -- and not in a good way. commenter mug costanza called getting rid of his cell phone after the contract expired ""one of the most liberating experiences i've ever had,"" and said he's beginning to notice the walking dead all around him. ""now it seems really weird to me when i am in a doctor's office or subway and i see 95% of the people around me glued to their phones, clicking away like zombies,"" he said. ""my favorite is when you go out with a group of friends and everybody at the table is just playing with their phones instead enjoying themselves with real live people."" indeed, dozens of commenters asserted that they don't own a mobile phone, or have stopped using them. some say the tight economy has given them extra incentive. that's the case with commenter wordswords, who says that in real life, he is the patriarch of the words family of cape coral, florida. he and his wife have six children, and that means a lot of phone bills if each family member has their own phone. ""i gave up my cell phone about two years ago,"" words commented. ""i made a commitment to saving money and our family went back to a single land line. since then i estimate we've saved around $4,000. and we haven't lost or damaged a phone since!"" after the economy went downhill, the family had lost income and needed to cut down their bills. words said getting rid of eight cell phones ""cold turkey,"" a phrase often used in connection with addiction, has been a worthwhile decision. ""the kids all hate me, but they enjoy the roof over their heads and the food on their table,"" words said. ""my two eldest have jobs and did get their own, but hey, as long as they're paying for it themselves, i'm all for it."" since they are a large family, the words upgraded to two phone lines to ease the strain. the family still keeps their disconnected smartphones to use with wi-fi connections while traveling on vacations, which words said is a luxury they now can afford. there are other benefits, too. ""the constant 'ding' of texting is gone, so we communicate with words and in person like a family should, instead of with words on a phone,"" he said. ""we love it. others don't understand us, but that's all right."" expense was a great motivator for aspiring musician and aspiring writer ben joynes, 31, of san francisco, california, who decided that he had to focus on what was really important in life. ""do the math. i simply cannot afford a cell phone contract, and it does not give me functionality that i absolutely need in my life in order to stay reasonably connected with people or be functional,"" joynes said. ""my little brother who lives out of state has one, and i've tooled around with it extensively. i think they are amazing pieces of technology, and i can see how they enhance people's lives. they are 'star trek' technology -- literally -- today and in the palm of your hand. i just can't afford one, and prefer to do my computing on a pc."" going without a cell phone can even be a game or a goal. commenter bill murray said he is trying to see how long he can go without having a cell phone. he has never had one, and compares the challenge of stopping the use of such devices to ""an addict going through heroin withdrawal."" he loves technology, but doesn't want a cell phone. instead he uses vonage, a service that allows people to make phone calls over a data connection. ""as i fast approach my 50th birthday, i am starting to feel like i am one of the lucky ones for not having 'plugged' into the network,"" he wrote. ""like a smoker shortly after they quit, i can actually smell and taste the things that others cannot enjoy. don't get me wrong. i'm a technology lover and it has been a genuine struggle not to give in to the temptation that these amazing devices create. however, just like when i did quit smoking, i think i'll just focus on going one more day 'without' to see if i can curb the craving."" still, he doesn't think this will last forever. ""eventually, however, i realize that society will evolve to a point where i likely won't have a choice but to adapt to the technology. but, until then, i'll see just how long i can survive without this little mechanical addiction."" another reader, dawn lynn harvard, said she hates being tethered to a phone all day, and only keeps a phone for emergency cases.

"attorney general eric holder announced monday that members of the chinese military have engaged in the hacking of american businesses and entities, including u.s. steel corp., westinghouse, alcoa, allegheny technologies, the united steel workers union and solarworld. the victims operate in pennsylvania, and a grand jury there returned a 31-count indictment against members of the chinese military, accusing them of violating federal law by hacking to spy and steal secrets, holder said. the indictment alleges that five people's liberation army officers ""maintained unauthorized access to victim computers to steal information from these entities that would be useful"" to the victims' competitors in china, the attorney general said. their names are wang dong, sun kailiang, wen xinyu, huang zhenyu and gu chunhui, according to the indictment. the chinese government did not immediately confirm or deny the veracity of the names. in some instances, the hackers stole trade secrets that would have been ""particularly beneficial to chinese companies at the time that they were stolen,"" holder said. in other cases, they are accused of swiping sensitive internal communications that could provide a competitor or a litigation adversary with insight into the strategy and the vulnerabilities of the victimized companies and entities, he said. the attorney general said that he hopes the chinese government will work with american officials to bring the offenders to justice and that the united states intends to prosecute. the chinese embassy in washington referred questions to a statement on china's foreign ministry site in which spokesman qin gang called the charges ""extremely absurd."" he said that the united states ""has fabricated facts"" and that china is a ""staunch defender of cyber security."" the statement said the chinese government, its military and ""associated personnel never engage in any theft of trade secrets."" the indictment ""severely violates basic norms of international relations, and harms cooperation and mutual trust between china and the united states,"" the statement said. china protested the u.s. action, the foreign ministry statement said, and wants it to ""correct its mistake"" and withdraw the charge. china is a ""victim of u.s. cyber surveillance and theft,"" the spokesman asserted, saying that ""certain u.s. agencies have been consistently tapping into china's government agencies, corporates, universities, and private networks for surveillance purposes."" sensitive subject a spokeswoman for the state department told reporters that washington wants to have more dialogue with beijing about the issue. ""we remain deeply concerned about chinese government-sponsored, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets and other sensitive business information for commercial gain,"" jen psaki said. ""and, again, this was specific to the actions of ... of just a few individuals. and we hope that the chinese government can understand that."" this was a law enforcement case, she added, not a diplomatic one.

""we're ready to work with china to prevent these types of activities from continuing."" joining holder, david hickton, u.s. attorney for the western district of pennsylvania, said the alleged hacking has caused the victimized u.s. companies to lose capital investments in research and technology. he added that the ""important message"" is that cyberespionage ""impacts real people in real and painful ways,"" he said. ""the lifeblood of any organization is the people who work, strive and sweat for it. when these cyberintrusions occur, production slows, plants close, workers get laid off and lose their homes,"" hickton said.

"while president barack obama held a news conference on thursday where he announced an administrative fix to the affordable care act, it quickly digressed into a confession and apology hour. he took the blame. he called the rollout of obamacare ""rough."" he said he ""fumbled."" he said the problems are ""on me."" he also offered an olive branch to his colleagues on capitol hill and acknowledged his party's tough circumstances. ""there is no doubt that our failure to roll out the aca smoothly has put a burden on democrats, whether they're running or not, because they stood up and supported this,"" obama said. can congress really save insurance plans lost under obamacare? ""i feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them, rather than easier for them,"" he added. it's tough to be a democrat now less than a month after the government shutdown during which the republican party seemed doomed for a generation -- or at least through 2014 -- the democrats are now nervously tapping wondering what went so miserably wrong. the botched obamacare rollout has put political pressure on the democratic party as members backed the president health care agenda as he said on thursday ""through thick and thin."" obama's self-deprecating confession, combined with his administrative ""fix"" to allow people in the individual market to keep their current insurance plans, did not, however, completely alleviate concerns of democratic lawmakers. obama unveiled remedies for people whose insurance plans have been canceled, despite repeated assurances that if you like your plan you can keep it. he said the federal government ""isn't going to get in the way"" of insurance companies offering plans to existing customers in the individual insurance market that don't meet minimum coverage requirements. frayed nerves for instance, senator mary landrieu, d-louisiana, said she is still going to push her legislation that would also address the problem. and senator kay hagan, d- north carolina, told cnn she is inclined to support landrieu's bill. it goes a little bit further and has more teeth. obamacare rattling democratic nerves both landrieu and hagan are up for re-election next year. they are not alone. a handful of other democratic senators have to tread carefully as do dozens of democratic house members. the president's announcement came as democrats repeatedly rang alarm bells over the canceled plans. former president bill clinton chimed in, saying obama should keep his promise. some democrats say it doesn't go far enough because the onus is on insurance companies and state insurance commissioners to extend the plans for an additional year. the insurance trade lobby, america's health insurance plans, released a statement saying the last-minute changes could ""destabilize the market and result in higher premiums."" many in congress avoiding obamacare exchange insurance cancellations exist on top of a troubled website and lower-than-expected enrollment figures. the real test on whether obama alleviated democratic concerns will be if democrats back a republican proposal friday by rep. fred upton of michigan that would largely undermine obamacare. upton's bill would allow affected insurance plans to extend into next year and gut a major part of the affordable care act by allowing anyone -- not just the 5% of people in the individual market place - to purchase low-coverage plans. obamacare prohibits discrimination for preexisting conditions and mandates coverage for mental health, prenatal care and other issues. this is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage. trust with the problems facing obamacare, public opinion of the president has declined. his approval rating among american voters has dropped to its lowest number in a quinnipiac university polling since he became president with new doubts being raised about trust. fifty two percent of respondents said the president is not trustworthy. obama appeared to understand the severity. ""i am not a perfect man and i will not be a perfect president, but i'll wake up every single day working as hard as i can on behalf of americans out there,"" he said. obamacare promises: where things stand cnn chief political correspondent candy crowley said obama's diminished trustworthiness will make the remaining implementation of obamacare challenging.

"-- investigators exhumed the mother of one of mexico's most notorious cartel kingpins monday, two weeks after thieves apparently made off with her son's body before authorities could conclusively confirm his identity. now they plan to do dna tests to verify that the man they killed in a gunbattle earlier this month was heriberto lazcano lazcano, leader of the zetas drug cartel, mexico's attorney general's office said. masked federal police monday guarded the cemetery in central mexico that houses the mausoleum containing the remains of lazcano's mother, mexico's state-run notimex news agency reported. photos: mexico drug war desperation it was the latest chapter in a dramatic saga that has cast a cloud of mystery over what could be one of the biggest accomplishments of outgoing president felipe calderon's crackdown on cartels. mexican authorities have said they have no doubt they killed lazcano, thanks to fingerprints and photograph evidence. but additional tests will allow them to reach 100% legal certainty, prosecutors said. ""taking tissue samples (from a direct family member) is necessary to complete laboratory studies of the genetic fingerprint, according to the most modern and advanced protocols for identifying people,"" the office said. on october 8, authorities proudly trumpeted the death of lazcano, who was known as ""el lazca."" the next day, they revealed they no longer had his body; gunmen had stolen it from a funeral home. they also said that members of mexico's navy shot him dead without realizing that the man in the suspicious car they'd chased outside a local baseball game on a sunday afternoon was the head of the ruthless zetas cartel. mexican navy: zetas leader captured ""two people were killed, but for us, they were just two more criminals. we had no clue that it was el lazca,"" vice adm. jose luis vergara, a spokesman for the navy, said in an interview with mvs radio shortly after authorities announced the news. vergara said investigators thought he was ""a criminal, not even a capo, most likely a hit man in the town or something like that."" officials said a fingerprint match after the autopsy confirmed he was the man mexico's president described as ""one of the most important and most dangerous"" people on the country's list of most wanted criminals. the united states and mexico combined had offered rewards of more than $7 million for information leading to his capture. lazcano was a onetime special forces soldier who became a founding member of the zetas, a group accused of some of the most violent atrocities that have come to define the drug war. lazcano, 37, joined the mexican armed forces in 1991 and was part of its elite airborne special forces group, dedicated to battling drug cartels. soon after, lazcano and several other special forces members were recruited by the gulf cartel to create its enforcement arm, the zetas. zetas' founder sentenced to 35 years after the partnership ended in 2010, the zetas split into a major drug trafficking organization and have since branched out into extortion, kidnapping and human smuggling. analysts have said it is unclear what impact lazano's death will have on the zetas. the cartel had been in the midst of a bloody turf war with its former employer, the gulf cartel, and also with the sinaloa cartel. the fight for access to lucrative smuggling routes in northern and central mexico has left thousands of civilians dead. mexican authorities: suspect arrested in falcon lake killing cnnmexico.com and cnn's catherine e. shoichet and mariano castillo contributed to this report.",investigators will conduct dna tests to confirm the killing of the zetas leader
"-- with the architect of the september 11, 2001, attacks dead, u.s. commandos in osama bin laden's pakistan compound quickly came upon another prize: a trove of hard drives, dvds and thumb drives that might provide evidence of other al qaeda operations. those materials, seized after bin laden and four others were killed, have provided the first specific alert to come out of monday's raid. the u.s. department of homeland security released a notice tied to rail security thursday. the unclassified notice to ""federal, state, local and tribal partners"" says that, in february 2010, al qaeda members discussed a plan to derail trains in the united states by placing obstructions on tracks, according to a law enforcement source who received the notice. pakistan reacts angrily to tone of u.s. questions the plan was to be executed this fall to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks. but no specific city or rail system was identified in the notice, the source told cnn. although a u.s. official cautioned that the information doesn't appear to suggest an imminent plot against u.s rail systems, the discovery may be the tip of the iceberg of potential plots. the haul included ""lots"" of paper documents, 10 hard drives, five computers and more than 100 storage devices, such as disks, dvds and thumb drives, a senior u.s. official said wednesday. since monday, intelligence experts and others have pored over the find. a task force was set up at the cia to comb through the evidence seized in the raid, according to a senior intelligence official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. more details emerge about the raid at a senate judiciary committee hearing wednesday, u.s. attorney general eric holder said of evidence taken from the residence, ""as we glean information from that material, we will make appropriate decisions with regard to who might we add to the terrorist watch list, the no-fly list, all those things."" the u.s. official who spoke thursday of the data said, ""we take every possible threat seriously, so we are running all of this to ground."" when asked if there were any indications that bin laden had signed off on the rail operation, the official said, ""there is no information to suggest that there was some kind of 'blessed operation' attached to u.s transportation systems."" the same u.s. official says the al qaeda scheme, which included derailing trains over bridges and valleys, ""doesn't appear to be anything more than an idea on paper at this point."" material also indicated that al qaeda was particularly interested in targeting cities -- washington, new york, los angeles and chicago, the official said. authorities sifting through the material learned al qaeda has considered striking on significant dates such as july 4, christmas and the opening day of the united nations, according to the official. osama's wife: we lived there 5 years department of homeland security spokesman matt chandler echoed the belief that there was no imminent threat to the rail system. but officials ""wanted to make our partners aware of the alleged plotting,"" he said. ""we want to stress that this alleged al qaeda plotting is based on initial reporting, which is often misleading or inaccurate and subject to change."" since sunday, chandler said, the department and other agencies have reviewed potential terror targets and deployed additional officers to nonsecured areas at u.s. airports. homeland security secretary janet napolitano told federal lawmakers wednesday a ""number of actions"" have been taken in response to the killing of bin laden, among them ""surging some resources"" to u.s. ports, airports and borders. ""these include issuing advisories to fusion center directors, homeland security advisers, major city chief intelligence commanders, private sector critical infrastructure owners and operators and other law enforcement entities,"" she said at a senate hearing. ""we are and have been reviewing all open cases of potential al qaeda core, aqap (al qaeda in the arabian peninsula) and aqim (al qaeda in the islamic maghreb) operatives possibly in the u.s. in conjunction with the fbi,"" she added. sen. joe lieberman, the connecticut independent who is chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, asked napolitano about the data removed by the navy seals from the bin laden compound. ""i assume that as this material is gone over, anything related to homeland security will be shared immediately with your department?"" he asked. napolitano responded, ""it is being shared (already)."" earlier this week, former cia director michael hayden told cnn's ""the situation room"" that the ""diffuse"" nature of al qaeda is among its strengths.

"-- the worst of a brutal winter storm may be over for many, but plenty of residents of the great plains and kansas city still were coping tuesday with its effects. ice and falling branches downed power lines, cutting electricity to tens of thousands of people. and the heavy, wet snow made getting around difficult, whether by car or by foot. a cnn crew driving through kansas city saw very few other drivers, and those who were out were taking their time. residents, hit by back-to-back snow storms, just want a break. ""it's been a long, what, seven days, 10 days, something like that,"" kansas city resident and snow shoveler lindsey hughes said. ""i'm ready to go home."" the storm is weakening as it moves to the northeast and the moisture is being stolen by the rain, cnn meteorologist chad myers said. ""this is great news,"" myers said. ""the rain is taking the moisture out of the storm and taking the punch out of what could be the snow part of the storm, and it's raining out rather than snowing out."" that means areas hit with snow tuesday won't see accumulations like portions of texas, northwest oklahoma and southern kansas got monday. rain was falling tuesday afternoon over much of the midwest. there likely will be snow all day in chicago, myers said. more than 330 flights at o'hare international airport and 170 at midway international airport were canceled tuesday. the storm is far from done. about 45 million people in 21 states were under some form of winter weather watch, warning or advisory. ""this storm is still a very active and dangerous storm, from michigan into western new york and the mountains in new england are getting hit with very heavy snows, said louis uccellini, director of the national weather service. the cold air associated with the system will linger on the east coast through the weekend, he said. but to the west, piling snow damaged buildings tuesday in kansas and missouri. in shawnee, kansas, the roof of a horse arena collapsed under the weight of snow tuesday morning, cnn affiliate kshb reported. it was one of several such collapses in the region because of the wet heavy snow, the station said. no injuries were reported in those collapses, but a person died monday in a roof collapse in hard-hit woodward, oklahoma, said mayor roscoe hill. two other deaths came in kansas on monday in separate weather-related accidents on interstate 70. one accident happened in sherman county and the other in ellis county, the kansas national guard said. more than 56,000 customers in kansas and missouri were without power tuesday afternoon, the kansas national guard said. the bulk of the outages -- 45,000 -- were in the kansas city region straddling the border between kansas and missouri. most flights out of kansas city international airport were canceled. roads were still snow-covered, but improving, in northwestern missouri, the state department of transportation said on twitter. the agency continued to discourage travel. forecasters expected the storm to bring up to a foot of snow to parts of eastern kansas, missouri and illinois a day after plastering southern kansas, oklahoma and texas. winter storm watches and warnings or weather advisories stretched from oklahoma to michigan. about 6 inches of snow fell in mediapolis in southeastern iowa, cnn ireporter rose schmidgall said. the high school student spent much of the day shoveling snow. ""the digging was difficult and took a little while. the snow was packed really good and was heavy to scoop,"" she said, adding her family still had power as of tuesday afternoon. track the storm while the back-to-back snowstorms were frustrating for some, others put a positive spin on the experience. jim service of overland park, kansas, spaced out the work of clearing last week's snowfall over four days. he finished sunday, just in time for this storm. after a warm-up session clearing tuesday's snow -- much wetter and heavier than last week's -- he retreated inside with a clive cussler novel and planned to enjoy the day off. like many others, service's company called off work tuesday at the behest of state officials who warned that the storm was too dangerous for people to be on the roads. ""it's great for me,"" he said. the kansas national guard warned that continued snowfall and gusty winds would make travel tricky through wednesday. in woodward, emergency vehicles were still having trouble getting around tuesday, a day after the storm dropped more than 15 inches of snow. crews dispatched to a house fire monday had trouble reaching the home because of 4-foot snowdrifts. the snowplow sent to free the firefighters also got stuck. even tuesday, emergency vehicles still were having a tough time getting around. ""we're in such a mess,"" said hill, the mayor. whiteout conditions the storm follows one last week that paralyzed a broad swath of the plains and midwest with more than a foot of snow. portions of oklahoma, kansas, missouri and other states were affected. the storm prompted a state of emergency declaration in kansas and parts of oklahoma, bringing whiteout conditions to southern parts of those states and texas. schools in wichita, kansas, were closed tuesday for a fourth straight day after last week's storm, which dumped a record 14.2 inches on the city. wichita has received 21 inches of snow in february, breaking a record that had stood for 100 years, the national weather service said. and it all fell in the past six days. are you there? send stories and photos cnn's brandon miller, erin mcpike, ric ward, janet digiacomo, ed payne, greg botelho, michael pearson and henry hanks contributed to this report.","new: snow headed for michigan, western new york"
"the amazing escape of three cleveland women -- amanda berry, georgina ""gina"" dejesus, and michelle knight -- exploded into the media amid sordid back stories of their captivity and gave life yet again to my own dark memories of captivity and despair. at age 13, i, too, became the helpless victim of a sexually depraved monster, a vicious internet predator who actively groomed me. luring me from my home, he abducted me to virginia where i was held captive in his basement dungeon. for days, i was raped, beaten and tortured, and like an animal, chained to the floor by a locking dog collar. my abductor shared my degradation via streaming video, boasting online about the young girl he had taken to be his sex slave. it was this very brazenness that would lead to my rescue, as one recipient of the live broadcast, afraid of his own involvement in the crime, scoured the newspaper and found my national center for missing and exploited children missing person flier. seeing that my family and the fbi were searching for me, he used a pay phone to contact authorities. this led the fbi to where i was being imprisoned. the chain was cut from my neck; i was set free and gifted with a second chance at life. had that call not been made, or had the investigation taken only a bit longer, the monster would have most likely murdered me. sadly, 74% of stranger-abducted children will be killed within the first three hours. abused but alive: lessons from survivors though my rescue was miraculous, recovery and re-assimilation has been difficult. despite this, at 14, after an all-too-brief period of healing, i began to speak out and share my story with students, parents, teachers, law enforcement -- anybody who would listen. i came to realize that other children need not suffer my traumatic experience, and so the ""alicia project"" was born. continuing my mission, i've joined discovery id to raise awareness of, and effect change for, issues such as internet safety, missing persons, human trafficking and child safety awareness education. i was attending an amber alert roundtable in florida when news broke of the cleveland rescue. few have had positive outcomes; their loved ones have been recovered deceased or not at all. those whose children have yet to be recovered are searching tirelessly, proclaiming that they will never give up. i watched their faces light up as they heard the news. you could almost hear each of them say, ""that could be my child!"" these women are unbelievably lucky to have been pulled from the hell they were suffering and given another chance. they are excited to be back with their families and/or loved ones and everything is moving so quickly that their pain and trauma may be eclipsed by their joy. unfortunately, this is likely to be short-lived. the vast majority of those who have survived a traumatic experience suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. nightmares, flashbacks, an inability to be in large crowds, hypervigilance, etc., may become a part of their daily lives. it's important for those around them to be sensitive and to allow them to express their pain. letter from a kidnapping survivor additionally, people must also temper their questioning of the events that unfolded while the girls were missing. it is their story and their choice whether to share it. they do not owe that to the world. privacy is essential. survivors, aware of the agonies their families have endured, may feel the need to appear to be ""fine"" because they do not want to add to their loved ones' grief. this is one of the many reasons counseling is vital for healthy mental well-being, as it provides a forum in which to speak freely without concern for the reaction of others. healing, for each of us, is an ongoing process. i still have days where i suffer from ptsd, but they are becoming less frequent. traumas don't simply vanish, but we can definitely choose to fill our lives with positive experiences as time goes on. what people should take from this story is a message of hope. we must never give up hope that any child, whatever the circumstances, will be rescued and returned safely home. amanda, michelle and georgina, you have so many wonderful things in store for you. only those of us who have experienced the terror of threatened captivity may truly appreciate the hero you became as you seized that chance of escape, amanda. together, you survived. welcome home, heroes.",alicia kozakiewicz was abducted at age 13 and taken to virginia
"-- during summer, hollywood seems more fixated on the teen dollar than ever, but every once in a while, a movie comes along to prove that older audiences haven't been forgotten entirely. often enough, that movie stars meryl streep, and here she is again with ""hope springs,"" a funny, outwardly modest comedy that manages to feel utterly novel by focusing on the sexual and emotional needs of an older woman. the promotional campaign pushes the raunch as if this were a judd apatow production. you can hardly blame the marketing guys for that (even if the tv spots do give away the movie's kicker), but it's a gross misrepresentation of an expertly written, sensitively handled movie with two wonderful actors grabbing the chance to show something honest about a relationship gone stale. tommy lee jones is arnold, a crusty accountant who spends his evenings falling asleep in front of his golf shows but doesn't see anything wrong with a marriage that has worked quite efficiently for 31 years. streep's kay is no feminist, and you wouldn't call her liberated either, but she can't stand the loneliness any longer. her husband hasn't touched her in years, they sleep in separate rooms, and they don't talk really, much less kiss. summoning all the reserves she has left, she insists on intensive couple therapy, a week in maine with dr. feld (steve carell). reluctantly but pragmatically, arnold goes along, grouching and grizzling every step of the way. a good deal of the movie plays out on the couch, and jones gets the lion's share of the laughs just by virtue of his orneriness and evident discomfort sharing intimacies with a stranger. two strangers, really, because his wife doesn't have a clue about feelings he's barely admitted to himself. jones has played his crankiness for comic effect often enough over the years, but director david frankel (""the devil wears prada"") keeps the actors rooted in naturalism, not caricature, and it's exciting to see jones respond with a performance of discipline and subtlety. when he does turn that frown upside down, it's pure joy, and we finally appreciate what kay must have seen in this selfish bully. if we're honest, streep's also been known to overplay comedy, and yes, she does have to nibble on a banana in one of the movie's more predictable turns, but at heart this is a lovely portrait of repressed housewife and mother finding the courage to put everything on the line late in life. you find yourself gazing at her face for fleeting inflections of optimism, excitement and melancholy. carell, you should know, plays his part absolutely straight; it's the definition of a supporting performance. the writing is sharp enough that the humor doesn't need to be forced. even in these sexually candid times, there's still a residual squeamishness where sexagenarian sexuality is concerned. screenwriter vanessa taylor is a producer on ""game of thrones."" in her first produced film script, she strikes a fine balance between comedy and pathos and between the separate but related estrangements that have crept up on husband and wife over the years. can such things be cured in a week of counseling and carefully choreographed ""sexercises?"" the movie is romantic enough to have us believe it, in part by making it clear that love requires real effort -- and faith -- as well as wine and roses. streep fans, i think you're going to enjoy this one. i know i did.","""hope springs"" is a rom-com featuring a mature couple, meryl streep and tommy lee jones"
"-- republican national committee chairman reince priebus gave voice wednesday to the mistrust between his party and president barack obama after the president said he was ""not going to just wait"" on republicans to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

""all he's been doing for the last year is lying to hispanic voters across the country."" while both parties said wednesday that they hoped to find common ground, they also signaled imminent conflict. obama made it clear that he was still planning to pursue executive action on immigration reform this year. the expected next senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker john boehner penned an op-ed in the wall street journal on wednesday laying out their agenda for the next two years -- which includes repealing obama's signature health care law. and priebus also questioned why republicans should compromise with obama. ""after the american people repudiated the policies of barack obama and everyone that was connected to him, to now say 'well, what are you guys going to do to compromise with the person the american people had just repudiated?' i think it's a little bizarre,"" priebus said. in an editorial entitled ""now we can get congress going,"" boehner and mcconnell spent most of their ink touting their legislative agenda and the chance to pass bills that majority leader harry reid has kept off the senate floor. the republican leaders pledged to pass legislation to repeal obamacare and authorize the keystone pipeline -- both measures democrats have ardently opposed. reid spokesman adam jentleson fired back in an email thursday accusing mcconnell of ""letting senator [ted] cruz set the agenda"" by vowing to repeal obamacare and pointed out that the word ""compromise"" was ""conspicuously absent from senator mcconnell's vision for the next congress."" and after slamming democrats for keeping bills from getting a vote, the pair signaled that republican control of congress will herald a new era of more inclusive governance. ""we will restore an era in which committees in both the house and senate conduct meaningful oversight of federal agencies and develop and debate legislation; and where members of the minority party in both chambers are given the opportunity to participate in the process of governing,"" mcconnell and boehner wrote. the top two republicans in congress also left a key item off their agenda in the editorial: immigration reform. the two sides continued to butt heads over the issue on wednesday. mcconnell said during a press conference wednesday that executive action from obama would be a ""mistake"" and would ""poison the well."" mcconnell also said there ""certainly are going to be areas of disagreement"" and said obama ""has really got a choice."" that choice should be to ""give the new congress a chance"" on immigration reform, said sen. lindsey graham, who is considered by many to be the linchpin of any comprehensive deal on immigration. ""'at the end of the day the republican party would benefit from getting immigration reform off the table,"" graham said wednesday on cnn. graham was one of tuesday night's victors who got a call from obama. and graham said he told the president to be patient, but also challenged the gop on immigration reform.",rnc chairman priebus said wednesday he doesn't 'believe a thing' obama says
"-- any kid can dream up a roller coaster. but those who visit a new exhibit at walt disney world's epcot theme park can actually take a ride on their fantasy creations. an artist's rendering of the ""sum of all thrills"" interactive ride, opening wednesday at disney world. epcot on wednesday opened a new attraction called ""sum of all thrills,"" which lets kids use computer tablets to design a virtual roller coaster, bobsled track or plane ride. after inputting their designs, kids climb into a robotic carriage that uses virtual-reality technology to help them experience the ride they've created. ""this is really the next generation -- where there's a lot more personalization involved"" in the amusement-park experience, said eric goodman, disney's lead project manager on the ride. this make-your-own-ride approach appears to be a growing trend in the world of amusement parks and museums. taking cues from the video game industry, park and ride designers have realized that people -- especially young ones -- want to interact with and even design their own thrill rides. in addition to the new epcot ride in orlando, florida, two disney theme parks feature a ride called ""toy story mania,"" which lets riders shoot at targets as they roll down the track and, in doing so, shape their own ride experience. another disney attraction, cyberspace mountain, caters to adults and kids by letting them customize their own virtual ride from a menu of drops, loops and other features. universal studios in florida opened a roller coaster in august called the ""hollywood rip ride rockit,"" which lets people create their own personal musical soundtrack for their ride. interactive rides are in the ""baby stages"" so far, since roller coasters and theme-park attractions are so expensive to build, but interaction and personalization promise to be running themes in the industry, said bob mctyre, president of apogee attractions, which has has helped design rides for disney, universal studios and others. mctyre was not involved in the new ride at epcot. he said theme park designers frequently bring up ideas such as roller coasters with three possible endings, allowing riders to choose which path to take. but those big ideas quickly hit a roadblock: the high costs of implementing such a project, he said. shawn mccoy, vice-president of marketing and business development at jack rouse associates, another amusement-park design firm, said this desire for interactivity in amusement parks takes its cues from video games. ""there's also a definite need to compete with video games or the gaming industry -- where [players] have control over all of the elements, from the environment to the players' movement,"" he said, noting that museums and zoos also are taking notice of the trend. the ""sum of all thrills"" ride at epcot employs a robotic arm -- more commonly seen assembling cars at an auto plant -- to let kids experience their roller coaster creations. sitting in a carriage with their legs and arms outside the ride, kids watch a video version of their ride while the arm moves them from side to side and up and down to simulate the feeling of a real roller coaster. fans blow air at the riders at various speeds to give people the sensation that they're moving forward. goodman, the disney designer, said the robotic arm and carriage come ""pretty darn close"" to replicating the real roller coaster experience. kids design their experience on touch-screen computers, using a digital ruler and pre-selected track options to construct their rides. if a person tries to build something physically impossible -- a hill that's too steep for the cars to climb, for example -- then they're asked to retool their ideas. disney hopes the interactive nature of the epcot ride also helps kids learn that math and science can be fun. ""i think it's really empowering for the kids to realize that the math doesn't control them. they get to control the math,"" goodman said. the raytheon company, a maker of weapons and defense systems, said it sponsored the exhibit as a way to get middle-school aged kids more interested in careers in math and engineering.",disney opens an exhibit where kids create roller coasters -- and ride them

"-- judging solely by the headlines, one might conclude that china's economy is finally starting to hit a wall. after several decades of near double-digit annual growth, gross domestic product rose by a relatively cool 7.5% in this year's first half. property prices are down. so is investment in factory capacity and real estate. but companies that interpret slower gdp growth to mean that business opportunities in china and other emerging markets will begin to fade are making a serious mistake. the consumer class is still growing rapidly in key emerging markets, and the competition from savvy, extremely capable domestic companies is intensifying. in china's case, the lower gdp growth rate actually reflects an important structural shift in the economy -- from growth that is driven by extraordinarily high fixed investment fueled by loans from government-owned banks to growth that is driven by private consumption. this transition has been a top goal of the chinese leadership as it seeks more balanced and sustainable economic growth. china illustrates an important phenomenon found in many emerging markets. what many gloomy economic reports miss is that private consumption continues to rise. this is fueled by steady, rapid growth in the country's middle-class and affluent households, which in china we at the boston consulting group (bcg) regard as having annual disposable incomes of at least $12,500. since 2010, people living in middle-class and affluent households surged from 10% of china's population to 25%. in just another three years, this share is projected to leap to 35%, according to bcg analysis. some of the sharpest consumption growth in china is occurring among the upper middle class, which we classify as households with annual disposable household incomes of $25,000 to $50,000. the population in this income segment has been has been rising 12% annually. astonishingly, chinese upper middle class are projected to account for 5% of global consumption by 2020. these consumers are the sweet spot for many international companies because they tend to sharply accelerate their consumption in such product categories as automobiles, premium personal-care products, fresh foods, financial services, and travel. while companies like the e-commerce giant alibaba generate the most buzz, it is only one of many innovative companies prospering from the rapid growth of china's middle class. at bcg, we have been tracking a particularly impressive group of hard-charging competitors that we refer to as ""local dynamos"" -- emerging market-based companies that are staying home and conquering their domestic markets. the dynamos move at breathtaking speed, have formidable business models for catering to local consumers, are highly adaptable and are remarkably adept at taking advantage of digital technologies. they have averaged compound annual revenue growth of 28% annually over the past four years, compared with 5% annual growth among s&p 500 companies. eleven of the 50 dynamos that we identified globally in a recent report are consumer goods companies -- more than from any other sector. this reflects the opportunities created by surging consumption in emerging markets. ten of the 50 are based in china. they span sectors from banking and food retailing to consumer electronics. home inns & hotels management illustrates how chinese dynamos can operate successfully while moving at warp speed. home inns saw a huge opportunity in the underserved and highly fragmented market for budget hotels. from 2008 to 2013, it increased its number of hotels from 500 to more than 2,000, in part through an aggressive strategy of franchising. it also boosted the number of cities served from fewer than 100 to 300. with revenues of $1 billion in 2013, home inns controls nearly 25% of china's branded economy-hotel segment. xiaomi, another dynamo, demonstrates the digital prowess of china's new breed of consumer-product companies. xiaomi relies entirely on e-commerce to sell its affordable smart phones, which are priced at between $100 and $300. to reach china's internet-crazed youth, xiaomi uses a variety of popular social media to extensively market its products and solicit customer feedback, which it incorporates when designing and improving its devices. after just three years in operation, xiaomi reached $5 billion in revenue in 2013 and sold more smartphones in china -- nearly 19 million -- than apple. xiaomi passed samsung in the second quarter of 2014 as china's top smartphone brand. even if companies have little interest in the china market, the local dynamos should be on their radar because they are potential future global competitors. a number of companies on bcg's 2014 list of ""global challengers"" -- fast-growing companies based in emerging markets that are becoming global leaders or have the potential to do so -- have followed the path of leveraging their dominance in domestic markets to go global. twenty-nine of the 100 challengers on the 2014 list are chinese, including appliance maker haeir group, automaker geely international, and medical device producer

"(cnn) -- the bahrain grand prix will not go ahead after organizers said friday that they had abandoned plans to re-schedule the race later this year. bahrain were to host the opening race of the 2011 formula one season on march 13, but it was postponed on february 21 after civil unrest in the gulf kingdom. last week, the world motor sport council re-instated the race and gave it a provisional date of october 30. the decision drew widespread criticism and former fia president max mosley told cnn tuesday that he would be ""astonished"" if the race proceeded. red bull driver mark webber also weighed in, telling his official website:""i'll be highly surprised if the bahrain grand prix goes ahead this year."" the formula one teams association also confirmed to cnn tuesday that they had written to world governing body the fia, formula one commercial boss bernie ecclestone and the bahrain international circuit to express their views on the issue. the bahrain circuit's chairman zayed r alzayani confirmed their decision in a statement on their official website friday. it read: ""whilst bahrain would have been delighted to see the grand prix progress on october 30th in-line with the world motor sport council's decision, it has been made clear that this fixture cannot progress and we fully respect that decision. ""bahrain has absolutely no desire to see a race which would further extend the calendar season detract from the enjoyment of f1 for either drivers, teams or supporters,"" he said. the inaugural indian grand prix, scheduled for the october 30 slot at a new circuit on the outskirts of new delhi, was set to be pushed back to december but can now go ahead on its original date. about 30 people have died during protests in bahrain, according to figures from the government, opposition figures and human rights groups. opposition and human rights groups say the government has detained more than 1,000 people. a state of emergency was lifted last week and bahrain grand prix organizers remain hopeful that they can stage a race in 2011. ""we look forward to welcoming teams, their drivers and supporters back to bahrain next year,"" read the statement.",bahrain grand prix organizers abandon plans to stage a race this year
"-- akil vohra quit a lucrative job in international trade litigation to take up something he strongly believes in -- as a legal expert, a muslim and, most importantly, he says, as an american. he wanted to make sure that muslims could fulfill zakat, one of the five pillars of islam that mandates the giving of alms. zakat is especially important during the holy month of ramadan, which ends on saturday. but after the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, a dark cloud hung over muslim charities as the federal government heightened scrutiny over terrorism concerns. zakat suddenly became a risky religious obligation. agencies all over america from women's shelters and health clinics to inner-city community centers saw donation checks dry up. ""the fear of giving was very real, said vohra, 33, who now works for san francisco-based muslim advocates, an agency that was created to address two needs in post-september 11 america: racial profiling of muslims and charitable giving. muslim advocates partners with the better business bureau to attain accreditation for muslim nonprofits so that agencies can attain greater transparency and overcome perceptions of wrongdoing. plus, people can feel more at ease about their donations. the muslim charities accreditation program, which began in august 2008, examines nonprofits and trains agency leaders to comply with the federal government's legal and financial regulations, said vohra, the program's legal counsel. just before the start of ramadan a month ago, three nonprofit organizations had met all 20 standards required for accreditation. vohra said several others are going through the process. in turn, vohra hopes that muslim charities will start seeing more dollars come their way. ""we don't make comments on which group to give to,"" vohra said. ""what we're concerned about is giving the right way -- best practices for zakat. ""to be able to give freely is a right of all americans."" he said. vohra takes phone calls from people around the nation seeking guidance. ""we're planning to send money,"" people tell him. ""is this group ok? what's the best way to send our donation?"" because of the widespread concerns, muslim advocates decided to upload a guidance video on youtube. it asks people to consider donating to u.s.-registered tax exempt charitable organizations. it tells them to make the intent of their donation clear, keep records and perhaps ask for proof that the funds were used for their intended purpose. the guidance became essential after the federal government cracked down on muslim groups in 2001, vohra said. according to the american civil liberties union, the bush administration froze the assets of three u.s. charities -- the holy land foundation for relief and development, global relief foundation and benevolence international foundation -- during ramadan in 2001. six others have been shuttered to date, the aclu said. only one, the holy land foundation, was tied to terrorism after five of its leaders were convicted of providing money to the palestinian militant group hamas. ""the government's actions against these three charities were the start of a pattern of conduct that violated the fundamental rights of american muslims' charitable giving in accordance with their faith,"" the aclu wrote in a report published in june. it said the result was that many in the american muslim community restricted or stopped their donations altogether out of fear that they would be investigated for terrorism. vohra, however, is hopeful the tide is turning. president obama signaled change in his historic speech to the muslim world delivered in cairo, egypt, earlier this year. obama said he was committed to working with american muslims to ensure they can fulfill zakat. vohra said the accreditation program, along with new government perspective, can return confidence and comfort to a religious obligation for muslims. ""it's been tough for american muslims post 9/11,"" he said. ""this has to do with civic engagement, to be treated as full americans.""",u.s. government started cracking down on muslim charities after 9/11 attacks

seeing giant redwoods towering above him, but his relatives living in the midwest and east coast refused to believe that trees actually grew to be so large. realizing that most people had never seen giant redwoods, the logger created the one log house and put it on wheels so that he could tour the country. schmock and a friend spent eight months hollowing out the 7-foot-tall, 32-foot-long section of redwood. holding a living room, kitchen and bedroom, the log house was similar to other mobile homes, except that its tremendous size and weight made mobility challenging, requiring special permits to drive on each state highway. although the house traveled on occasion, it spent most of its time ""resting"" in small towns along the northern california coast. now, one log house espresso and gifts sits on highway 101, south of garberville, where it's been for the last 15 years. the small cafe sells food, beverages and redwood gifts and has some relics of the old-time logging days. admission is

house, also out of beer cans. ripley's believe it or not estimated that 50,000 beer cans went into making john milkovisch's tribute to recycling. in 2001, years after milkovisch passed away, the

"(cnn) -- a residential building in spokane valley, washington, was being decontaminated after police removed a half pound of highly sensitive explosives from one of the apartments, a sheriff's spokesman said. john d. raymond, 53, is being held on a civil bench warrant and is likely to face charges in district court tuesday of illegally manufacturing and possessing explosives, said sgt. dave reagan of the spokane county sheriff's office. raymond uses a wheelchair to get around and lived in a ground floor apartment of the 10-unit building. he was transported to jail by ambulance, reagan said. a police robot removed a half pound of tatp, or triacetone triperoxide, from raymond's apartment, reagan said. tatp is extremely sensitive to impact, temperature change and friction, according to the defense and military web site globalsecurity.org. it has been used by suicide bombers in israel and was chosen as a detonator in 2001 by the thwarted ""shoe bomber"" richard reid. the tatp in raymond's apartment was placed in a bomb-proof container and taken to a county-owned gravel yard for detonation. ""it is too unstable to save as evidence,"" reagan said. a secondary sweep of the apartment did not turn up any more tatp, but authorities were concerned about material found in the kitchen sink. as a precaution, the spokane fire department hazmat unit has been called in to decontaminate the scene before residents are allowed to return to their apartments. reagan said raymond was angry about how his divorce case was being handled. cnn's greg morrison contributed to this report.",police remove a half pound of highly sensitive explosives
"-- u.s. rep. barney frank, a prominent 16-term liberal democrat from massachusetts and arch-enemy of political conservatives nationwide, announced monday that he does not intend to seek re-election in 2012. frank, 71, said his decision to retire from congress was prompted partly by changes made to the boundaries of his u.s. house district. as part of massachusetts' recently concluded redistricting process, frank's 4th congressional district will lose the heavily democratic blue-collar port city of new bedford while gaining several smaller, more conservative towns. ""i will miss this job, (but) the district is very substantially changed,"" with roughly 325,000 new constituents, frank told reporters. the veteran congressman said he was planning to retire after 2014 regardless, but said he didn't ""want to be torn"" next year between the need to serve his existing constituents, reach out to new district residents and protect his signature dodd-frank financial regulatory reform law. president barack obama issued a statement praising frank's public service, calling the congressman a ""fierce advocate for the people of massachusetts and americans everywhere who needed a voice."" while massachusetts' entire house delegation is democratic, local republicans insist frank's retirement will put the reconfigured district in play. ""it is clear that congressman frank was not looking forward to another hard fought campaign after losing his gerrymandered district and spending nearly every penny he had in 2010,"" massachusetts republican party executive director nate little said in a written statement. ""republicans were already gearing up for a strong race and frank's sudden retirement injects added optimism and excitement into the election."" frank, first elected to the u.s. house of representatives in 1980, is the top democrat on the powerful house financial services committee. the controversial 2010 dodd-frank measure, designed to rein in wall street excesses after the 2008 financial collapse, passed the house without any gop support. frank made headlines earlier in his career by becoming one of the first openly gay members of congress. he was formally reprimanded by the house in 1990 for allegations relating to his association with a male prostitute. launching his career as an aide to boston mayor kevin white in the late 1960s, frank quickly became known for an acidic political wit. ""one of the advantages to me of not running for office is i don't even have to pretend to try to be nice to people i don't like,"" frank joked with reporters monday. ""some of you may not think i've been good at it, but i've been trying."" frank's current district -- which extends from the affluent, liberal boston suburbs of newton and brookline to the cities of new bedford and fall river -- is considered safe democratic political terrain. frank did, however, receive an unusually strong challenge from republican sean bielat in 2010. frank ultimately defeated bielat, 54% to 43%.",frank says his new district boundaries contributed to his decision to retire
"-- the dieting world screams with contradictory advice: carbs are evil; carbs are good for you. ""good fat"" is healthy; ""good fat"" has tons of calories. diets targeted at carbohydrates, proteins or fats result in similiar results, as long as calorie intake was reduced. researchers at the harvard school of public health and the pennington biomedical research center put four popular diets -- high carb, high fat, low-fat and high protein -- to the test to see which of the regimens resulted in more weight-loss success. after two years of monitoring the participants, ""all the diets were winners,"" said study co-author dr. frank sacks, a professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at the harvard school of public health. ""all produced weight loss and improvements in lipids, reduction in insulin. ""the key really is that it's calories. it's not the content of fat or carbohydrates, it's just calories,"" said sacks. the findings are published in the latest edition of the new england journal of medicine. for the study, 811 overweight adults in boston, massachusetts, and baton rouge, louisiana, were assigned to one of four diets. a quarter went on a carbohydrate-heavy diet, some on high-fat, others on low-fat and the remaining on high-protein diet. the four diets were not based on popular diets, sacks said. regardless of diet, most participants had dramatic weight loss after six months, losing an average of 13 pounds. according to sacks' research, many of the 800-plus participants regained weight after a year, but about 80 percent of them lost at least eight pounds after two years. and 15 percent of the participants lost at least 10 percent of their body weight. the study, funded by the national heart, lung and blood institute of the national institutes of health, showed little difference in users' satiety, hunger or satisfaction with their diets. participants could attend individual sessions where dieticians educated them and group sessions where they discussed their experiences with one another. those who had better attendance in the sessions had stronger weight-loss results. ""these findings together point to behavioral factors rather than macronutrient metabolism as the main influences on weight loss,"" according to the study. macronutrients are the three main nutrients the body uses in relatively large amounts: proteins, carbohydrates and fats. watch the comparisons among four diets. » ""no one of those diets are necessarily better than any other diet,"" sacks said. in an accompanying editorial in the new england journal of medicine, martijin b. katan wrote the researchers' hypothesis is ""plausible,"" but said the ""differences in macronutrient intake were too small."" there was an underlying similarity between the four diets. on average, the overweight participants had a 750-calorie reduction per day. an average-sized male who consumed 2,800 calories a day was prescribed just over 2,000 calories and a woman who ate 2000 calories a day was prescribed 1,250 calories. all diets were compatible with american heart association guidelines, sack said. the study did not give the participants food. for the first 10 days, participants received menus, then were assigned to create their own using the healthy food options. depending on their prescribed diet, participants ate a wide range of carbohydrates, fat and protein, derived from healthy foods, such as olive oil, pasta and nut butter. from these results, sacks recommends going with ""the diet you feel most comfortable that is healthy, that appeals to you in terms of what foods are in it, that isn't a drastic crash diet. whatever allows you to keep the calories down and not feel really deprived."" calorie restriction can be done without feeling deprived, said dr. luigi fontana, an associate professor of medicine at the washington university who studies the effects of calorie restriction on longevity. but he warns against just halving a person's current diet. share your weight-loss success story with ireport.com. ""a lot of people think of calorie restriction like eating half a hamburger, half a pack of french fries -- that you can obtain by reducing in half your portions,"" fontana said. ""that's calorie restriction with malnutrition."" dr. melina jampolis, the diet and fitness expert for cnnhealth warned against drastic measures like completely focusing on one macronutrient. ""people want to be extreme,"" she said. ""you say cut back on sugar, they cut it completely. the take-home would be that there is no markedly superior diet. if there was, people wouldn't stick with it anyway."" cindy moore, the director of nutrition therapy at cleveland clinic and a registered dietician agreed. ""people gravitate to the latest fads or trends, because they may have known someone who was successful in losing weight. that friend may have been in that early grace period of losing weight. the other thing is people think they need that magic bullet."" but a significant change in eating habits -- like cutting out an entire nutrient group like carbohydrates, proteins or fats, often can't be sustained. weight loss tends to be dramatic during the first few months. brenda driver, of springfield, missouri, was not involved in the study but says she lost 10 pounds in 10 days on the atkins diet by eschewing all carbohydrates. the 26-year-old and her fiance said they were ""not looking at a crash diet, but want to jump start weight loss."" the former vegetarians began eating meat again because of the high protein demands of the diet. driver said she's aware the atkins diet is not an ideal long-term plan. six years ago, she tried the diet for seven months and lost 45 pounds. she finally quit the diet because of her chocolate cravings. this month, driver and her fiance decided to give the atkins another try. ""i want to rebel against the whole, 'you're-engaged-now-you-have-to-lose-weight,' "" she said. but it would be nice to look slimmer in those wedding photos, she said. ""i'm approaching it as a temporary thing. vegetarianism is where i want to be the rest of my life."" moore said the basics of losing weight boil down to this: limit the calories consumed so a person is taking in less than the body needs or increase activity to burn more energy. the problem, she said is that, ""people get discouraged if weight loss is really, really slow.""",researchers test four diets for weight-loss effectiveness

""what this does show is there is a lot of skepticism with the base with chuck schumer, because he's so close to wall street, and it's an issue they've really been hammering on,"" kucinich said. ""so watch for more of that, because i have a feeling that they are going to make their voices heard, through warren or not."" 2. a good week for boehner. yes, you read that right. it has been a rocky year for house speaker john boehner, but his allies think they may have just turned a corner. the house of representatives passed the republican budget last week as well as a big medicare change known as the ""doc fix"" because it clarifies reimbursement rates to medicare providers. npr's juana summers shared reporting on how team boehner hopes that ending the month with a little momentum will carry over when other big legislative battles come to the fore. ""part of (his success) is because of the speaker's willingness to use unconventional tactics, to work with democrat nancy pelosi for that medicare reform,"" summers said. ""congress has a lot of big deadlines when they return. so whether or not he can hold onto that power instead of seeing it slip will be really fascinating."" 3. bush-rubio? rubio-bush? watch the real estate listings! jeb bush and sen. marco rubio both call florida home. and both want to be the republican nominee for president. they also happen to be on friendly terms. so among florida republicans who love them both -- there is talk of a ""dream ticket."" of course, it won't happen. can't happen. rules and all that pertaining to the president and vice president coming from the same state.

"-- the musician bjork is releasing the first ever app-album. it's called ""biophilia,"" and it goes on sale in the apple app store on tuesday. the app-album is a collection of games, visualizations and musical scores that accompany bjork's songs, which also is available for a traditional audio-only download. each song, in effect, becomes its own visual-and-audio experience, letting bjork's fans interact with her songs in an entirely new way. the main ""biophilia"" app is available for free. each sub-application, which contains a song and some sort of interactive game, costs 99-cents, or $9.99 for the whole album. a non-app version of the album also is available. the icelandic artist is known for being innovative. her 2004 album ""medulla"" was composed almost entirely from human voices, which were remixed into a myriad of sounds. on ""volta,"" she used touch-sensitive instruments that predate the ipad. ""apps and ipads are just tools -- they have to be human and they have to have soul,"" she said. bjork sat down with cnn to talk about the creative process and purpose behind ""biophilia."" you can listen to a cnn radio report podcast of the interview. the following is a transcript: cnn: how did the idea of creating an app for your album or wanting to make your music interactive first come about? bjork: well, believe it or not, this project started because i wanted to simplify things, and then ended up being one of the most complex things i've done. but the initial idea, in a way, was because of the arrival of the touch screen. i was already on my last tour from 2006 to 2008, the ""volta"" tour. i had a touch screen instrument called the lemur and another one called reactable. and i was performing or people who were playing with me in the band were on those. once the tour was finished in 2008, i was excited not just to perform with touch screens, but to write with them or kind of use it as much as you could. for me, it tapped into an issue i had as a child and sort of had since. cnn: even before you started with this project and started developing with these technologies to write these songs in creative ways, what has been your experience with listening to music? how do you experience music? is this something you wish had been around before as a way for you to interact with other artists' music? bjork: that's a good question, i never really thought about that. yeah, for sure! people obviously tend to be scared of new tools and always think they have no soul in them. the reason why there is no soul in them is because no one put it there, like you cannot really blame the tool ... obviously technology is so sophisticated now that you ... don't have to be the biggest programming genius on earth to do it. you can do it now in a simple way. and i feel if some of my favorite musicians would do something like this, it would obviously be important that they would do something that is idiosyncratic for them. that it is not just accessorizing their music just for the novelty factor. because tools are just tools and obviously apps and ipads are just tools, they have to be human and they have to have soul. cnn: could you elaborate on the educational workshops that you'll be doing and why they are important for you? bjork: the core of this project is kind of educational, not only that i want to teach basic musicology for beginners, but it actually ended up being the project that i learned most. i feel like i've been three years in this intense university. so that's really the core of the project. it's hard to say why. maybe i'll look back in 10 years time and say why. it felt like the shows are only a part when i'm obviously singing and expressing myself. but it also had to be the other angle where the kids could come and they could express themselves and be interactive. so far, we've gotten offers from some natural history museums and science museums around the planet. because it would be nice if it was not just the musical side of things, but also the biological. for example, they could come in and they could play with crystals and biologists could tell them about crystals. and musicologists could tell them about structures in music. then they can get the app to try it out, write their own little songs, and put it on a usb key and take it home. that's the way i think it will work best in the spirit of the project. it cannot really be without that aspect. cnn: what do you hope people can get out of this app and this experience of interacting with your music? bjork: for me, obviously, i want to show that there's connection between nature and music ... it's kind of an interesting project because i understand it more now that i am doing interviews than when i was doing it -- that the core or idea of this project is taking something that has usually been quite academic or bookish and making it impulsive and tactile. so actually explaining it or doing an interview about it or writing or reading a press release about it, makes it sound like 500 times more complicated that it actually is. it's like trying to explain how to dance in an e-mail. if you would just turn it on and do it together, it'd be way easier. i am hoping that it would sort of dissolve this vip status that musicology has -- that's in only for the chosen few, if you are super clever, and you've studied for billions of years, you understand about scales.","bjork's new album, ""biophilia,"" debuts on tuesday"
"beijing (cnn)when it came to the environment in china, it was hazy through much of the weekend -- literally and figuratively. as a thick layer of toxic air blanketed beijing and much of northern china on friday, censors smothered a wildly popular but controversial documentary on the country's air pollution, removing it from all major video streaming sites. at a standing-room-only press conference saturday, the newly appointed minister of environmental protection ignored raised hands of foreign journalists eager to ask about the development and made no mention of the documentary that he had praised just a week earlier. without a hint of irony, he promised to be more transparent and reassured the masses of their right to oversee the government's fight against air pollution. ""under the dome"" -- a slickly produced two-hour documentary on journalist chai jing's dogged quest to find the causes and solutions to china's severe smog problem -- attracted over 200 million views online in just one week, an unprecedented number even in the world's most populous nation. supporters and detractors of chai, a famous former anchor and reporter at state-run national broadcaster cctv, began a war of words almost immediately after the video's release on february 28. admirers compared it to ""an inconvenient truth,"" the oscar-winning documentary on former u.s. vice president al gore's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming. critics, on the other hand, portrayed it as a piece of shoddy investigative journalism filled with bad science and biased conclusions, which blamed the problem largely on the entrenched interests of the state oil industry. some even called it propaganda for president xi jinping, who had declared keeping the sky blue a top policy priority. the new environment minister's initial response to the video -- in the form of a widely reported text message of gratitude to chai -- reinforced some doubts over chai's claim of editorial independence for her self-funded project. many more people, however, perceived it as an encouraging sign of the government's adoption of a more open attitude to a politically sensitive topic, as xi and other leaders started to publicly acknowledge the severity and urgency of the issue. but such optimism was dashed 24 hours after the documentary's launch, as censors moved to reign in increasingly heated online debates surrounding air pollution and beyond, and removed all mention of the video from homepages of major websites. as the week progressed, leaked state media memos -- widely circulated on social media -- revealed ever-harsher wording from propaganda authorities as they scrambled to limit the continuing impact of the video. finally, after millions of clicks, ""under the dome"" vanished from much of chinese cyberspace friday as heavy smog descended on the capital. also in beijing were almost 3,000 delegates who had gathered to attend the national people's congress, china's rubber-stamp parliament that meets in full once a year to approve the ruling communist party's legislative proposals. pollution has remained a hot topic at this year's session, state-run xinhua news agency reported, adding that xi vowed to legislators friday ""to give an iron hand to any polluters in the smog-choked country."" with chai's viral video also encountering an iron hand, analysts explained that the seeming contradiction makes perfect sense in a one-party dictatorship with little tolerance for open dissent. ""smog is like any other problem in china -- dig it too deep and you touch the issue of political system,"" said yao bo, a well-known news commentator with more than 1.2 million followers on chinese social media. ""the video doesn't do that but comments on it had started to question the system."" ""i think the video caught censors off guard,"" he added, dismissing the idea that its fate reflected infighting among china's senior leaders. ""the censors eventually acted as expected, after going through this bureaucratic process that is always half a step behind."" as gusty winds blew away beijing's smog sunday afternoon, this much became clear to the public: in china, the government cares about the environment as much as you do, but only one of you is free to talk about it.",film on china's air pollution problem drew praise from environment minister when it came out
"-- the person responsible for a virginia tech student's death was familiar with the area where her body was recovered, police said thursday. the farmland site where morgan harrington's remains were found is the ""most significant"" aspect of the investigation into her death, virginia state police lt. joe rader said. he asked that members of the surrounding community call police with any details of the area and who has frequented it. ""people in north garden, people in the anchorage farm area, you know what goes on there,"" rader said, referring to areas of virginia's albemarle county. ""you know the history. you know who comes in and out of that vicinity. you may not realize it, but you probably have some information for us that you don't think is important."" morgan harrington disappeared october 17, after attending a metallica concert at the university of virginia's john paul jones arena in charlottesville, virginia. the 20-year-old education major was separated from her friends at the concert. a farmer discovered her skeletal remains on his 700-acre farm january 26, police said. the farm is about 10 miles from the concert site. there have been no arrests in the case, police said. the cause of her death is still under investigation. investigators think that the farm ""did not present an unnecessary risk for the person responsible"" and that the person passed through or visited the farm or the nearby area, rader said. traveling to the area where the remains were found ""would have created a significant risk for any person not familiar to that area and not comfortable with that type of setting,"" rader said. ""farmland like the place where morgan's body was located has obstacles, difficult obstacles. it has streams, it has fences, it has defects, it has terrain that changes. that's important, that's a high-risk opportunity to pick that location to take morgan harrington unless you're familiar with the area,"" he said. ""we don't believe those are challenges that someone unfamiliar with the area would confront."" the farmer who found harrington's remains came across them in a remote section of a hayfield, police said last month. the farm's owner, david dass, told cnn affiliate wtvr that he was out looking for damage after wind and rain knocked down several trees in his yard when he found ""what looked like a human skull."" he told wtvr that the area is at least a mile and a half from a main roadway. read more about the case from wtvr ""there is no public access to this particular area. the hayfield was last cut in august 2009 and would have been possibly waist-high by mid-october 2009,"" a january police statement said. on the october night harrington went missing, she had left her friends to use the restroom during the concert, police said. when she did not return, her friends called her cell phone at 8:48 p.m. she told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its policy, police said, but she told them not to worry about her and she would find a ride home. there are restrooms inside the arena, police said, and authorities do not know how or why harrington got outside. witnesses who saw her outside the arena said she did not appear to be with anyone, police said. about 9:30 p.m., witnesses reported seeing a person matching harrington's description walking on a nearby bridge, police said. no further sightings were reported. harrington's purse, with her identification and cell phone inside, was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena, police said. a friend had driven harrington's car to the concert, she said, and still had the car keys when they became separated. police are asking anyone with information on the case to call 434-709-1685. the family will hold a mass for harrington on friday in roanoke, virginia.

"there had been ""growing concern"" about former u.s. secret service director julia pierson's leadership in the two weeks since a man with a knife managed to jump the white house fence and get into the east room, a source tells cnn. but the ""final straw,"" the source said, was that she and the agency did not inform the president about a september 16 breach at the cdc in atlanta -- in which a private contractor who had a concealed gun shared an elevator with president barack obama -- until just before the media reported it on tuesday afternoon. ""the problems about the elevator breach were a) that it happened, b) that no one told the white house about it in the midst of two weeks of many discussions with them about security and then c) that the president didn't find out till just before the media was about to report it,"" the source said, agreeing that ""final straw"" would be an apt description of that event. elaborate video shows entire security breach at white house the source, who spoke to cnn anonymously so as to speak more candidly about sensitive events, said that there was every reason to believe pierson and secret service leadership took the september 19 fence jumper incident ""very seriously,"" though white house officials were not pleased with how facts and details about that incident kept changing, both in public media accounts and to them privately. that, however, could be explained and understood, the source said, given the ""fog"" of conflicting accounts inherent in such an intense and adrenaline-filled event. there was no such understanding about why, two weeks after the september 16 elevator incident at the cdc, the president was not informed until just before the washington examiner and washington post were prepared to share details of that event with the world. there was no going back; she had lost obama's confidence that she was the right person to run the agency. on wednesday, homeland security secretary jeh johnson said he had accepted pierson's resignation and was appointing an independent panel to investigate the white house breach. presidents are loath to publicly criticize the secret service for fear of straining any relations with the agents who keep them alive and protect their loved ones. so perhaps it was left to senate majority leader harry reid, who told reporters in nevada on wednesday, ""i am just so disappointed in what i've seen. i can't imagine being a father of two girls and seeing this happen in my home. i'll bet michelle is just beside herself -- they are so protective of those two girls. so i can't be a cheerleader of the secret service today.""",source: concern had been growing about secret service director after east room breach
"-- if california's kevin mccarthy ascends as expected to the no. 2 republican leadership position in the house, one thing is assured: he will be dogged by the ever-present political specter of immigration reform. mccarthy's backers are hastily shoring up support for his candidacy as majority leader, but so are immigration reform advocates who want to make clear to him their expectations for action. labrador jumps into race for house majority leader texan sessions drops bid to succeed cantor in house leadership ""there is no reason for congressman kevin mccarthy, as leader, not to take leadership on this issue,"" said immigration reform activist arturo rodriguez, president of united farm workers. ""everyone will expect it and demand it. and we will step up all of our activities as a whole."" such is the thorny predicament for the politically savvy lawmaker viewed as most likely to succeed eric cantor as majority leader. cantor's primary loss in virginia set in a motion a scramble for the position. then again, mccarthy, who actor kevin spacey reportedly shadowed in preparing for his role as majority whip frank underwood in the netflix series ""house of cards,"" is used to such plot twists. is d.c. real life ""house of cards""? mccarthy's own rapid rise is the stuff of a political soap opera. he is the boy from bakersfield who married his high school sweetheart and plunked down money he won in a lottery to start a deli. he used those earnings to go to college before entering politics. his boss, former house ways and means chairman bill thomas endorsed his young staffer to replace him in 2006. since then, mccarthy has easily won every subsequent re-election and has risen quickly â€” and shrewdly, friends say â€” through the house gop's leadership ranks. he's now considered the frontrunner for the majority leader's job. ""we've been friends for many, many years now, but he looks at things differently,"" said fellow california republican rep. jeff denham. ""he has the foresight to know when to push and when not to push and he understands when's the right time to get something done."" for example, mccarthy last year voted with many house republicans, but not denham, to defund the obama administration's efforts to halt the deportation of young immigrants in the military or in school. this year, he's supporting denham's measure to help provide a path to citizenship for young immigrants who are also members of the military. doing the math down but not done: cantor's loss not end for immigration reform that's not to say there haven't been stumbles and miscalculations. mccarthy became the party whip soon after the republican takeover of the house. but his ability to count and rally votes behind leadership's priorities were tested after partisan battles over raising the debt ceiling and funding food stamps. mccarthy's affability has been key to helping soothe ruffled feathers, friends say. fellow california rep. david valadao counts mccarthy as ""both a close friend and a respected colleague,"" and he's gotten a chance to see the would-be majority leader up close as they and others in the delegation worked together on issues of providing water to their central valley region as well as infrastructure needs, he told cnn in a statement. mccarthy often orders takeout and invites house members to his office to eat and talk about issues affecting their districts, their spouses and children, denham said. ""he invites members to his office and it's like sitting around the family dinner table,"" he said. ""he also takes the time to go to people's districts all across the nation."" a tale of two republicans: a story of the gop and immigration reform careful calculations friends say mccarthy, 49, will need that personal touch for crafting relationships and a sense of timing on hot button issues, should he be elected leader next thursday. that's because fallout from tackling immigration reform could prove politically perilous if cantor, who has endorsed mccarthy, is any indication. dave brat used cantor's willingness to consider a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants to hammer home his point that he'd lost touch with his constituents. that, analysts say, was crucial to his victory in the reliably conservative richmond-area district. ""i think his (mccarthy's) views on immigration are similar to cantor's,"" said steven camarota, director of research for the non-profit center for immigration studies. ""but after this week's results, it seems much less likely he would push it. and even less likely still that he would move his members to push it."" conservatives are pushing aggressively to have one of their own fill mccarthy's current job as whip and join the house gop leadership ranks, which would create an interesting dynamic between the top two republicans in the house and the whip. gop ""trapped"" by amnesty mccarthy's home turf is california's 23rd congressional district, a republican stronghold ripe with lush farmland in the shadow of mountain ranges. it is also a place that is 35% latino and where the local business community has made clear that it depends heavily on immigrant labor to pick such crops as grapes, oranges and tomatoes. ""we have spoken with congressman mccarthy and his staff about immigration reform and its importance to our local and regional economy,"" cynthia pollard, president and ceo of the greater bakersfield chamber of commerce told cnn in a statement. ""i led a delegation of several other business leaders in a meeting with congressman mccarthy last fall in washington, d.c., to discuss the issue. he expressed at that time and has since reaffirmed his commitment to a step-by-step assessment and overhaul of the system that is clearly broken."" in the meantime, immigration advocates who have hosted protests and sit-ins at mccarthy's district offices in the past vow they are poised to do so again if they sense he's unwilling to tackle reform. ""as the person responsible for scheduling house votes, when it comes to immigration reform mccarthy will either be a hero or a zero,"" frank sherry, executive director of america's voice, an immigration reform advocacy group, said in a statement. ""he can save the gop from itself by quickly scheduling a vote on historic legislation that the majority of the house, the country and even his district supports; or he can squander the opportunity. ...the future of the gop may well hinge on his choice,"" he said. complete coverage of 2014 midterm elections five things to know about kevin mccarthy house republicans elect mccarthy to take cantor's job",rep. mccarthy may face pressure on immigration reform if elected majority leader
"(aol autos) -- ever get the feeling the cops are driving a much cooler car than you? peter falk's liutenant columbo drove a peugeot 403 to match his famously disheveled detective persona. for decades drivers have seen police officers cruise past in supremely cool cars from supercharged mustangs to upgraded amc javelins and beyond, while modern police units often consist of high-powered dodge hemis and, in one incredible instance, a lamborghini. cops or detectives portrayed on tv and in the movies are no different, often driving fatter rides than the drug-dealers they pursue. but which are the coolest cop rides of all time, real or fictional? let's take a look. dodge charger hemi one of the original muscle cars favored by blue mountain moonshine and marijuana smugglers to outrun the boys in blue in the 1970s got a swift turnaround a couple years ago with dodge's earth-shattering introduction of the new charger, its hemi engine and its use by police forces across the nation. officers generally compare it favorably with standard crown victoria vehicles and laud its performance and versatility (which i can vouch for having tested the stock r/t last year); upgrades for police use one include steering, brakes and idle-time chip. almost all are 5.7-liter hemi variants, which put out a whopping 368hp and top out at 170 mph. aol autos: dodge charger 'knight rider's' ford mustang gt500kr forget david hasselhof's speak-n-spell-voiced trans-am, we're talking serious muscle with ford's monstrous ford mustang gt500kr that featured in last year's ill-fated reworking of ""knight rider,"" a model i also ragged around los angeles port about this time last year (and was very careful not to attract the attention of harbor authorities). the most powerful stock car ford has built, the shelby variant seethes and stomps its way to a mile a minute in about the same time as a corvette but shades it for fun thanks to its astonishing 480lb-ft of torque at 4500rpm and solid-axle rear suspension that allows the back end to fly out on fantastic cop-car action sequences. trivia: k.i.t.t., the 1980s original smartcar, stands for knight industries two-thousand. aol autos: ford shelby gt500 italian police lamborghini gallardo want to make the 424 miles from turin to rome in under three hours? italian police long ago caught on to the race-driver fanaticism of its citizenry thanks in large part to ferrari -- and perhaps less so to fiat -- and its polizia made sure they could keep up earlier this year by springing for a lambo, perhaps the most incredible police vehicle on the planet. alongside undeniable performance, this specially equipped supercar offers real-time wireless image-and-voice transmitting equipment and a natty cooler for storing crime scene evidence. initial reports suggest the gallardo's reliability stands up to punishing police driving habits on italian autostradas surprisingly well. aol autos: lamborghini gallardo steve mcqueen 'bullitt' ford mustang gt long before the cooler king was the main man to seek out at tailgate parties, steve mcqueen took the nickname and turned on a whole generation to the muscle of the mustang in his 1968 gt 390 fastback that bounced and careened around the streets of san francisco, california, in perhaps the era's coolest film, and one which regularly tops the charts of best car chase captured on celluloid. the film pioneered cutaway shots of mcqueen, an avid rally driver, as he put the big-block pony through its paces in the 10-minute scene but, unusually for the king of cool, the main star here was his car. ford released a limited-edition bullitt commemorative model in 2008. aol autos: ford mustang green hornet 1966 chrysler crown imperial with some suggesting a movie remake of the 1960s cult series is in the works, attention now focuses on what will take the place of the ""green hornet's"" 1966 chrysler crown imperial, famously driven by bruce lee (in his role of kato). while the angular and rectangular black beauty pioneered gizmos like infrared lights, rocket launchers and flipper license plate more associated with bond's aston martin, it was always lee and not van williams, the hornet, who got the pleasure of tilting the car onto two wheels to get through narrow alleyways and other criminal hang-outs. keep your eyes out for the latest movie developments, which may or may not -- but should -- include the famous line: ""let's roll, kato!"" 1970s pony cars judging by the huge rims and lowered suspensions on the chevy tahoes currently patrolling santa monica beachfront, police departments often like to drop a hint of style and attitude in their rides, too. in the 1970s, decade of aviator sunglasses and massive sideburns, it was no different. officers to this day talk about the series of high-performance police vehicles that includes chevrolet camaros, ford mustangs and the legendary amc javelin, all stock v8 power with upgraded brakes and steering that packed more muscles than bubba in cell block d. most of these specially built units topped out near 150 mph and were especially prized for their straight-line capabilities while an officer in pursuit bumped and nudged his target vehicle in a bid to force them off the road. aol autos: chevy camaro ""miami vice"" ferrari testarossa the ultimate in machismo cool in its day, though now considered slightly cheeseball, crockett and tubbs defined 1980s new wave slick with their boss combo of boats, 'bans and miami beach swagger. though the daytona spyder 365 driven by the dynamic detectives in the first two series was a kit car replica of various ferrari panels and equipment bolted onto a corvette chassis, the twin testarossas that feature in the later series were donated by enzo ferrari, a fan of the show (with an obvious gift for marketing). the testarossa would go on to define the ferrari brand in united states in the 1980s, while a strange breed of setose men in linen suits with no socks can still be spotted in corners of ford lauderdale to this day. in director michael mann's 2006 movie, the testarossa morphs into a suitably stylish f430. magnum pi 308gts as if don johnson wasn't enough 1980s for one list, we add tom selleck to the mix in his role as ""magnum p.i."" without forgetting how much selleck's silky mustache and coiff did for sales of his trademark targa ferrari 308gts in the states. mid-engined and with the smaller wheelbase common to ferrari's of the period, 308s sold in record numbers for ferraris and can still be seen on roads today, indicating that scaglietti build quality can withstand some serious highway pounding that belies its lightweight fiberglass frame. selleck steered his on the mean streets of hawaii, tracking criminals in his role as a private investigator. not a police vehicle, you say? selleck's mustache qualifies him as an honorary police officer in my book any day. columbo's peugeot 403 ""and one more thing..."" wraps up our list with peter falk's liutenant columbo reveling in a dilapidated peugeot banger to match his famously disheveled detective persona. france's finest prancing lion, a 1.5 liter four-cylinder that put out a mere 68hp, was a perfect fit with falk's seemingly slow-witted persona that ultimately always got his man in the end. similarly, the 403, which columbo delighted in driving the drop-top variant, was a vital cog in peugeot's dominance of its domestic and european market with a series of idiosyncratic cars beloved by their followers but which remained a columbo-esque mystery to their detractors. i had the pleasure of driving an excellent peugeot 307 cabriolet next to a vintage 403 at a motor show in europe a couple years back, and felt a slight pang that i wasn't wearing a shabby raincoat to match. blues brothers interceptor mashup everyone knows the blues mobile -- jake and elwood's 1974 dodge monaco in ""the blues brothers"" movie -- but few know where all the cop cars famously smashed to pieces in the film came from. paul anderson, a journalist in los angeles, says it was his dad, also paul, a chicago, illinois, police radio engineer who was tasked with fixing up the dodge polaras and monacos wrecked in the film (with the chicago city council spurred into action by the possibility of steven spielberg and john landis coming to their city to make a big-budget movie). he once recounted to paul: ""i just remember one day my boss, the lieutenant who always gave me a hard time, came to me and pointed to the auto graveyard where all the out-of-service squad cars were and said, 'see all those cars? your job is to get them started.' i said, 'are you kidding?'"" paul adds: ""[my dad] had a savant-like ability to rescue beaters from near-death experiences. when the movie came out, he went to see it like everyone else and he could remember each and every one of those cars.""",officers laud the dodge charger hemi's performance and versatility

"(cnn) -- the turboprop plane that crashed in new york state, killing all 49 people on board and one on the ground, was one of the safest and most sophisticated aircraft of its type, according to an aviation industry expert. scandinavian airlines grounded its fleet of dash 8 q400 planes after three crash landings in 2007. the bombardier dash 8 q400 was less than one year old and had flown for only about 1,500 hours, said kieran daly, of the online aviation news service air transport intelligence. the continental connection flight 3407 was operated by colgan air between newark liberty international airport and buffalo. daly said propeller-driven aircraft such as the canadian-built bombardier dash 8 q400 and its european rival, the atr series, had sold well to airlines in the last three years because they were almost as fast as jets, cruising at about 480 kilometers/hour (300 mph), but used much less fuel. listen to audio of plane's last moments » however, despite an excellent safety record, some passengers were still wary of traveling on propeller planes, he said. daly said that for most of the time turboprops were as safe as similar-sized, 50-seater jets, but in icy conditions turboprops were at a disadvantage. stressing that the cause of thursday's crash in near buffalo was still unclear and could be caused by mechanical failure for example, he said the potential for ice was there because it was short and the plane would have been flying at a relatively low level. watch what ireporter captured on film daly said the pilot appeared not to have reported problems with icing, but this was not unusual because planes were designed to cope with these conditions. ""all aircraft have de-icing system: a big jet like a 747 can cope with ice almost indefinitely, but smaller planes, especially propeller planes can experience problems,"" he said. ""pilots cope by increasing altitude -- icing mainly occurs at lower levels -- but because propeller-driven planes are slower, they take longer to reach high altitude and spend longer in the icy conditions."" according to the national weather service weather observation for buffalo, there was light snow, fog and mist shortly before 10 p.m. watch more on the plane crash » cnn has listened to a tape of communications between air traffic control and the flight crew. the first officer had no sign of stress in her voice initially. the plane was cleared for approach. about two minutes later, the air traffic controller came back, with stress in his voice. radar contact was lost. watch report from witness: ""all i saw was flames"" » the question went out: can other planes see anything? no one responds. the controller says they might have a plane down. the pilot's last comment was ""colgan flight 3407."" there were no sounds of distress. watch video from cnn affiliate wgrz » scandinavian airlines (sas) permanently grounded its fleet of dash 8s after three crash landings during a two-month period in 2007 that were blamed on the aircraft's landing gear.

""i have decided to immediately remove dash 8 q400 aircraft from service."" air expert daly said though that in thursday's crash the landing gear of the continental plane was unlikely to be down because it was far from the airport. the national transportation safety board said early friday it was preparing to send a team to buffalo to investigate the crash. thursday's plane crash is the deadliest on u.s. soil since august 2006 when comair flight 5191 crashed when it attempted to take off from the wrong runway.",air expert: turboprop plane that crashed in new york one of safest of its type officials say all 49 aboard the plane died; one confirmed death on ground
"-- sitting in high school, math and history lessons never captured danny santos' imagination. the drug-fueled streets of the texas-mexico border provided his education, and he was an excellent student. danny santos, 21, works two part-time jobs and still doesn't make as much as he did as a drug mule. santos says he became one of the thousands of american and mexican teenagers recruited into the dangerous world of drug smuggling. ""i didn't care. i had no conscience,"" santos said at a boxing gym in el paso, texas. ""you're young, and you're naïve, and you think it's easy."" santos' journey into the underworld of teenage drug smuggling offers a glimpse into how drug cartels lure teenagers into doing their dirty work. us. customs and border protection officials in el paso and san diego report that in recent months, they've seen a rise in the number of juvenile drug smugglers getting busted at border checkpoints. they're often called mules. these teenagers are usually hired only to smuggle drug loads across the border. it's a short drive or walk that offers quick cash but can carry serious consequences. watch how teens get drugs across the border » drug cartels ""just need someone who can legitimately cross the border,"" said bill molaski, the el paso port director for u.s. customs and border protection. as an american, santos could freely cross the el paso-juarez border and not raise suspicion. at age 15, santos says, he met ""a guy"" at a party who introduced him to drug kingpins in ciudad juarez, mexico. ""you start off as a driver,"" santos said. ""people feel like they can trust you, then you move up to something bigger."" two weeks later, he got a $4,000 job offer to drive his first load of marijuana across a bridge into el paso. it was the beginning of a four-year smuggling career. ""i can't say i wasn't nervous,"" santos said. ""you kind of project yourself into another time of happiness or joy. ... you just have to forget you have something illegal in the car."" in all, santos says, he earned $50,000 making about 20 mule runs, driving right through heavily guarded border checkpoints. santos, who is now 21, says he was arrested once but spent only a few days in jail. he said charges were dropped. because he was younger than 18 when he was arrested, and juvenile cases are sealed, cnn could not confirm his story through court records. young smugglers don't fit a stereotype. several sources said that both american and mexican teens are lured into the work. teenage boys and girls alike are involved. many smugglers come from middle-class families. ""there's a lot of money in the trade, a lot of inducement for a lot of young people to get involved,"" el paso county attorney jose rodriguez said. his office is responsible for prosecuting juvenile smugglers. federal and state authorities say drug cartels recruit young smugglers from schools. depending on the size of the drug load that's being smuggled, a kid can be paid a couple hundred dollars up to $5,000. mexican officials say cartels have placed classified advertisements in mexican newspapers with cryptic messages offering young people a job with good salary and benefits. a phone number is included in the ad. the officials say a cartel member sets up a meeting to determine whether the kid is up to the job. but rodriguez offers a chilling reason why teenagers should avoid the lure of easy money. ""we had a kid here who lost a load and had some of his toes chopped off,"" rodriguez said. santos says he got out of the smuggling business two years ago. now he spends every day training at a boxing gym in el paso. boxing and smuggling can both be vicious worlds, but at least boxing is legal. however, it's a slow climb to the top of the boxing world. he's chasing the golden dreams of boxing championships and hoping to make more money boxing than he did smuggling. santos is working two part-time jobs, and he says it takes him two months to earn the money that he used to make in one day of drug smuggling. he spent almost all the money he made smuggling. but he has no regrets. ""the peace of mind is good,"" santos said after a bruising workout. ""i sleep good, eat good. i feel better now.""","danny santos, 21, says he made $50,000 in four years as a drug mule"

"mourners sat on mud floors at a village in india where two teen girls were gang-raped and then found hanging from a mango tree. they wailed and talked of fears of more attacks. the assault on the cousins, ages 14 and 16, sparked outrage in the community in uttar pradesh state. villagers streamed into the homes of the girls' relatives, weeping behind their customary veils. the mother of one of the girls said her daughter wanted to become a doctor to escape grinding poverty. the attackers, she said, deserved the same fate that befell her daughter. ""hang them in public,"" she said. cnn cannot identify the relatives or victims under indian law. in the northern village where the attack occurred, crowds surrounded the girls for hours after their bodies were found wednesday. they accused authorities of siding with the suspects and blocked them from taking the girls down from their nooses unless arrests are made. authorities arrested five men -- three brothers and two police officers -- who are facing rape and murder charges, said r.k.s. rathore, a senior police officer. in addition, the officers face charges of conspiracy in the crime and negligence of duty after villagers accused them of failing to respond when they first pinpointed the suspects. an autopsy confirmed that the girls had been raped and strangled, according to authorities. they were cremated the same day the bodies were found, in line with hindu customs, said mukesh saxena, a local police official. ""we are scared,"" said renu devi, a woman in the village where the attack occurred. ""if this could happen to them, it could happen to us also."" police under scrutiny devi has reason to fear. the girls were out in the orchard relieving themselves tuesday night when the attackers grabbed them, authorities said. toilets are rare in the village, forcing women to wander away into fields in the dead of night. ""there's no toilet. where can the girls go?"" shouted jamuni devi, another woman from the village. ""no one has done anything for sanitation."" indians have more access to mobile phones than to toilets, according to a united nations report four years ago.

""it is a tragic irony to think that in india, a country now wealthy enough that roughly half of the people own phones, about half cannot afford the basic necessity and dignity of a toilet,"" said zafar adeel, who chairs the organization u.n.-water. unable to stop some people saw the abduction but were unable to stop it, police spokesman saxena said, citing witnesses. his account echoed that of the father of the older victim, who alleged that a scuffle broke out between a relative and the three brothers suspected of the attack. ""they scared my cousin away with a locally made pistol,"" he said. the daughter he lost was his only child. the victims' relatives accused local police of failing to respond and siding with the suspects when the parents reported the case. the allegations have fueled anger among the villagers. ""if police wanted, my daughter would have been alive today,"" he said.

""prime news"" uses the day's most powerful headlines as a starting point for diverse perspectives, spirited debate and your points of view. mike galanos says child pornography charges are too harsh for teens caught ""sexting."" -- ""sexting."" have parents out there ever even heard of this term? whether you want to admit it or not, teenagers are sending sexual messages and naked pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and girlfriends. in most cases it's the girl sending a picture or message to the guy. if you're thinking to yourself right now, ""what's the big deal?"" then you should think again. this practice can ruin our teenagers' lives. six teens in greensburg, pennsylvania, were charged as juveniles with possessing child pornography after three girls sent nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves to three boys. it gets even worse. a 13-year-old boy in middletown, ohio, is facing felony pandering obscenities charges after taping a sex act and showing it to friends at a skating party. a felony? yes this kid needs to be punished but we don't need our 13 or 14-year-olds charged with child porn and lumped in with adult pedophiles and labeled as sex offenders. i've spoken with several attorneys on our show and it seems there is no one reason prosecutors are opting to charge teens with child porn instead of lesser charges. some may be doing it to ""send a message."" some may feel they have an obligation to charge these teens with the most serious offense possible and, according to the law, naked pictures of underage kids are usually considered child porn. and others may feel they are left with no options since there aren't really any laws that apply specifically to sexting. in any case, it's clear we need to change our laws to catch up with technology. a great illustration of why change is needed now is the story of phillip alpert, of orlando, florida. he didn't ask, but his girlfriend sexted him naked pictures of herself, according to the orlando sentinel. when they broke up, he mass e-mailed the photos to get back at her. alpert, 18, was convicted of transmission of child porn and he will carry the label of ""sex offender"" until he is 43. he lost friends, was kicked out of school, he can't even move in with his dad because his dad lives near a school. should phillip be punished? yes. should the six teens in pennsylvania face consequences? yes. but let's kick them off cheerleading squads and sports teams. make them do community service and take classes on sex crimes. educate other teens on the dangers of sexting. pay a price, yes, but these young people shouldn't pay for this for the rest of their lives. and if you think this couldn't happen to your kid, think again. sexting is more prevalent than you think. the national campaign to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancy teamed up with cosmogirl.com and asked over 1,200 teens about their sexual behaviors in cyberspace. according to their study, 39 percent of teens (that's ages 13-19) are sending or posting sexually suggestive messages over im, text or e-mail and around the same number of teens are receiving such messages. half of those teens, 20 percent, are sending or posting nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves. that's frightening. why are our kids doing this? on our show, psychotherapist stacy kaiser said, ""what i'm finding is a lot of girls are doing this because they're hoping it will help them get or keep a boyfriend."" the numbers agree with stacy. according to the study, 51 percent of girls say it's ""pressure from guys"" that's making them send sexual messages and pictures of themselves. so guys are expecting this and our girls are saying ""ok."" it makes me wonder how much progress we've really made in how young women are viewed and treated. the bottom line: we need to educate, not incarcerate, our teens and it has to start with parents. don't let the culture indoctrinate your little boy or girl about sex before their time. so strike first as a parent. if your kids are older, let them know a digital record is for life. when little suzie tries to win the affection of little bobby by sexting him a picture, she is putting her future at stake. there is no control over that image or video once it gets out. but that doesn't mean little suzie should be charged as a child pornographer. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of mike galanos.",mike galanos: teens are sending explicit photos of themselves to other kids
"having a ct scan of the heart to check for heart disease? you may want to ask how your hospital plans to conduct the test. a new study suggests that people who get the common heart test can get a dramatic range of radiation exposures. when cardiac ct angiography is used appropriately, the benefits far outweigh the risk of the radiation, experts say. in the study of 1,965 patients undergoing the ct scans (also known as cardiac ct angiography), the median exposure was roughly equivalent to 600 chest x-rays, or about 12 millisievert (msv) of radiation, according to the report in this week's issue of the journal of the american medical association. traditional angiography -- a technique in which a catheter is snaked though a blood vessel and dye is injected near the heart -- exposes patients to roughly half the dose of ct angiography, or about 5--8 msv, says study author jorg hausleiter, m.d., of the university of munich in germany. it's also about the same amount of radiation as other standard cardiac screenings, such as the nuclear stress test. there was a wide range of exposures in the study depending on the medical center and the way the tests were performed. the median radiation dose ranged from 4.6 to 30 msv. about 80 percent of the centers studied used techniques to reduce radiation, such as adjusting the ct scan to the patient's size (meaning smaller patients get less radiation) or precisely timing the radiation dose to a particular point in the heart rhythm (which shortens the duration of exposure). health.com: how to help your heart for better health overall, the danger posed by radiation is very small, according to hausleiter. being exposed to 10 msv increases an individual's cancer risk by 0.02 percent, he says. however, the greater the exposure to radiation, the greater the risk. watch dr. gupta talk about the cardiac ct scan » nearly all of the 50 sites in the international study, which included sites in the u.s., canada, europe, asia, the middle east, and latin america, were making at least some effort to limit excess radiation. other medical centers may be doing even less to cut down on radiation during the test, says andrew j. einstein, m.d., ph.d., of columbia university medical center, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. ""probably the group of centers which were studied in this paper are more sophisticated and more aware of radiation-reduction methods than your typical center that is performing cardiac ct angiography,"" he says. according to einstein, many other sites may not be using radiation-reduction techniques at all. when cardiac ct angiography is being used appropriately -- meaning, for example, in people with chest pain suggesting blocked heart arteries, rather than as a screening test for people with no symptoms of heart disease -- the benefits far outweigh the risk of the radiation, according to einstein and hausleiter. however, cardiac ct scans are often marketed directly to patients interested in finding out how much plaque they have in their arteries, even though there's no evidence to show that this is an appropriate way to use the test, hausleiter says. health.com: 28 days, 28 ways to slash your risk of heart disease critics of cardiac ct angiography question whether its benefits warrant its current widespread use and the amount of radiation exposure. in fact, on monday the american heart association issued an advisory warning that imaging tests, including ct scans, be used cautiously to minimize exposure to radiation. in the new study, hausleiter and his colleagues looked at patients who underwent cardiac ct angiography at 21 university hospitals and 29 community hospitals between february and december 2007. they found some regional differences in radiation exposure; for example, the median dose was three times higher in south america and latin america than in canada and the united states. more than 70 percent of the centers in the study were using electrocardiographically controlled tube current modulation (ectcm), which is currently the best-known strategy for reducing radiation dose. it involves timing the radiation beam to the diastole, when the heart is resting between beats. this is when the heart is the quietest, so it's easiest to get a good image of the organ. health.com: tricks to lower blood pressure another strategy involves using less energy (100 kv instead of the standard 120 kv), which is effective but useful only for patients who are not obese. finally, sequential scans take a series of pictures of the heart at the same exact point in the cardiac cycle, which also reduces radiation dose. this approach, as well as ectcm, can be used only in people with slow, steady heartbeats. another problem, einstein noted, is that doctors often don't know what a patient's heart rate will be until he or she is on the table being readied for the scan. but the fact that centers were able to use at least one radiation-reduction technique in most patients ""should serve as a wake-up call to cardiac ct laboratories that do not routinely use these methods,"" einstein writes in his editorial. health.com: i paid $450 to up my cancer risk patients who undergo cardiac ct angiography are within their rights to ask about what strategies, if any, are being used to reduce radiation dosage, he said. ""i would not recommend anyone to have this test done without discussing it with their doctor first. it's not something patients should be initiating on their own,"" he adds. caution is warranted not only due to the radiation exposure, according to einstein, but also because the dye that must be injected into the veins to perform the test can cause kidney damage in some people. while a person's doctor would be able to judge if he or she would be harmed by the dye and thus shouldn't have the test, he said, ""there are some sites that would be willing to perform this test on anyone."" david j. brenner, ph.d., d.sc., of columbia university's center for radiological research was not involved in the current study, but he coauthored a 2007 report warning that overuse of ct scans could contribute to excess cancer risks. he said that such ct scans are still controversial. new technology can decrease the radiation dose from cardiac ct scans, but as this study shows, ""it's very variable from institution to institution -- in part because there is no regulatory body making sure that there is some degree of quality control,"" says brenner. enter to win a monthly room makeover giveaway from myhomeideas.com copyright health magazine 2009",study finds dramatic range of radiation exposures for cardiac ct angiography

"-- remember when oil giant bp paid billions of dollars to clean up its own mess from the 2010 gulf oil spill? then the company agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and pay an unprecedented $4 billion fine for the spill. in the latest development, wednesday, bp was essentially told to stand in the corner when it comes to winning new federal contracts -- a potentially huge blow to the company's bottom line. and it's still likely on the hook for civil penalties the federal government hopes to recover for environmental damages. so, is bp being punished enough for the deadly and destructive deepwater horizon spill, or too much? it depends on who you ask. this matters. bp says it supports nearly a quarter of a million american jobs and has invested $52 billion in the united states since 2007. experts suggest punishments ranging from massive fines to banning the company from offshore drilling. however this all shakes out, it likely will send a powerful message to the industry. families of killed rig workers react to bp settlement first, here's what happened wednesday: the u.s. environmental protection agency said it will block bp from new government contracts due to its ""lack of business integrity"" stemming from the 2010 explosion and oil spill. it was a tragedy that killed 11 oil workers and dumped 205 million gallons of oil into the gulf in a slow-moving, 85-day national drama that prosecutors called the worst environmental disaster in u.s. history. this month hasn't been good to bp. the decision follows the london-based company's agreement november 15 to plead guilty to criminal charges including manslaughter, obstruction of congress and environmental violations related to the explosion and spill -- an agreement that still requires a judge's approval. what it means wednesday's epa decision means bp won't be allowed to compete for new contracts, grants or other business until the company shows it meets federal business standards. as of february, bp had $9 billion in contracts to supply the u.s. government with fuel, most of it destined for military users, said christine tiscareno, a london-based analyst with s&p capital iq. those contracts aren't affected by the epa decision, the agency said. bp said it's already filed paperwork to get back in good graces with the epa, said the agency is already preparing an administrative agreement to lift the suspension and highlighted what the company says it's done to rectify the situation. ""as bp's submissions to the epa have made clear, the company has made significant enhancements since the accident,"" the company said in a statement. ""the company launched an internal investigation immediately after the accident, publicly released the results, and has been implementing all 26 of the investigation's recommendations."" what's ahead the next big step in the case comes in february, when a civil trial is expected to begin over the government's demand for civil damages under the clean water act. that case could draw huge new fines for the company. the disaster, in addition to claiming 11 lives, caused disruption to countless residents and businesses, many of whom counted on the gulf for their livelihoods, whether in the oil fields, fishing grounds or tourist beaches. for some, including environmentalists, the company couldn't be fined enough or spend enough money to get back on their good side. ""well, you know, we're discussing the worst environmental disaster in u.s. history,"" said matt dundas, acting campaign director at the environmental group oceana. ""the punishment needs to fit the crime."" but, he said, the record $4 billion fine bp is expected to pay as a result of the criminal case is a tenth of the maximum it could have faced, making it small consolation to bp's harshest critics. the fine, while a record for the u.s. justice system, represents less than three months worth of profits for bp. the company reported $5.2 billion in profits in the quarter that ended september 30. dundas is now rooting for the maximum possible verdict in the civil case -- $50 billion in fines. but he says there's only one punishment that would really get bp and other oil companies to sit up and take steps to prevent what dundas says is the overwhelming risk of another large oil spill: being kicked out of the game entirely. ""i think a terrific minimum would be to bar them from offshore drilling,"" he said. ""that's really the only standard that's going to get oil companies to pay attention."" the head of a trade association representing bp and other oil and gas operators in louisiana and the gulf of mexico said wednesday that bp has already complied with government requirements. ""bp has done everything that the federal government has asked and more. ... this new epa designation is another layer,"" said chris john, president of the louisiana mid-continent oil and gas association. ""how much is enough, when the economy in america is trying to dig out of the recession, and energy ... is a very important component to getting americans back to work?"" the epa's decision could have a negative impact beyond bp, he said, affecting other companies in the industry who have also complied with regulators. ""the companies that operate out in the gulf of mexico, they can go anywhere, they're global. they can drill anywhere in the world,"" john said. ""they have chosen to come back to the gulf in the past few years. ... this additional statement and designation by the epa has to play into their decision of where to put their capital."" bp didn't directly address whether it believes it has paid enough for the disaster, but noted wednesday that it has spent $14 billion in response and cleanup costs, $1 million on restoration projects and $9 billion in compensation and expects to spend $7.8 billion more to resolve the majority of outstanding claims. owning up the company also pointed out it has acknowledged criminal responsibility, carried out recommendations made by investigators who studied the incident and has taken actions to strengthen safety and drilling standards that exceed federal regulations. tiscareno, the oil analyst, said that while the costs to bp have been steep, they are bearable for the company. the big question is what happens in february, when the civil case goes to trial. tiscareno said she expects bp, which has taken a long-term approach to recovering from the spill, will recover financially unless the civil trial nets an ""irrational"" decision. a huge verdict could pose problems for bp, tiscareno said, but she said the government can't go too far in gutting the firm because of all the jobs and tax revenues the company provides. bp has invested $52 billion in the u.s. in the last five years, employs 23,000 u.s. residents and indirectly supports nearly 250,000 jobs, the company said wednesday.

"-- as familiar and reassuring as the map of the world is, there is only so much that physical geography can tell us about the state of the planet. forest loss: this cartogram shows areas where the worst deforestation occured from 1990 to 2000. a new book, the atlas of the real world, has redrawn the map giving vivid new insights and bringing economic, social and environmental data to life. not since the german meteorologist, alfred wegener, sketched out the first detailed theories of continental drift has the world appeared so misshapen, so otherworldly. the 366 cartograms (statistical maps) which make up the book twist, shrink and distend countries and continents into all sorts of shapes and sizes. the book and the accompanying web site were devised by daniel dorling, professor of human geography at the uk's university of sheffield, anna barford, a research associate at sheffield and mark newman, a professor of physics at the university of michigan. work on the project began in earnest in 2006 when dorling teamed up with newman, who had co-created a new software technique for creating equal area cartograms the year before. with the software in place, the painstaking task of assembling the data began. the information was drawn from a variety of organizations including the united nations, the world health organization and the world bank. for ease of visual comparison, territories are split into 12 geographical regions -- e.g. blue for north america, brown for northern africa -- and shading marks out specific countries. the range of subjects is impressive, from greenhouse gas emissions, wealth and disease to more obscure data about numbers of dentists and working tractors. john pritchard, research assistant at university of sheffield and part of the team working on the project, told cnn: ""i think the maps of disease are particularly shocking and bring home the scale of the problem in africa better than a table of statistics does."" indeed, the map of malaria deaths is striking: 94 percent of deaths from malaria occur in africa, making the continent appear like a vast bloated blob. the rest of the world is reduced to a disparate series of veiny streaks. there are other sobering statistics to consider. in june 2008, principal voices spoke to head of research at oxfam gb duncan green about strategies to eradicate poverty. green talked about the education being crucial to breaking the cycle of poverty, particularly for girls. the new atlas's girls not at primary school cartogram graphically illustrates the lack of female education in many parts of the developing world. team members are currently working on a map of languages and soon hope to be producing animated maps. ""we have a series of maps that show deaths at various stages, which would be particularly suited to an animation, and we now have a phd student looking at extending the web site, including ways of mapping flow."" pritchard said.","the atlas of the real world brings economic, social and environmental data to life"
"-- way before people such as roseanne barr, kathy griffin and rosie o'donnell broke ground for women in comedy, there was phyllis diller. she got started in the late '50s, a time when female stand-up comics were a rarity. at this time, the concept of a woman's place was truly that it was in the home; women weren't supposed to be funny. and as much as they say nowadays that comedy and show business is a boys' club, it doesn't compare with the way it used to be. phyllis found her way in. today, some women may condemn other women for doing self-deprecating comedy, but phyllis did it and she took it to an art form and it wasn't threatening, it wasn't angry and, just in a nutshell, when all else failed, it was just plain funny. diller dies 'with a smile on her face' people have many theories about comedy, but being just plain funny is the one most important thing. you could not call phyllis just a funny stand-up comic. she was a gifted performer -- an actress equally adept at comedy and drama. after her first big appearances on ""the jack paar show"" brought her national fame, she had a successful career in movies, as a stage actress, at comedy clubs, on tv and on comedy albums. when i was a child, tv was packed with variety shows, and she seemed to always be on the air. she was the ultimate downtrodden, frustrated housewife. she portrayed it to a freakish degree. i remember her coming on to the screen with what looked like a fright wig. her hair looked like she had just stuck her finger in an electric socket. her dresses would be inappropriately short, and she would be holding her ever-ready, impossibly long cigarette holder. she appeared to be someone who would be a hero in the gay community, which she was. but phyllis was a hero for everyone. her jokes were always self-effacing and hysterically funny. here's one: ""you know you're getting old when your blood type's been discontinued."" here's another: ""i love to go to the doctor. where else would a man look at me and say, 'take off your clothes?' "" she used to talk about having a husband named ""fang."" no one ever saw this ""fang"" fellow, but to the tv public, he was mythical. we didn't know him, but we all knew him. he was stupid, frustrating and incompetent. we all had a very clear picture of him in our minds. she was much smarter than he was. because phyllis was clearly smart. she did uso tours through south vietnam with bob hope, and it is a testament to her skill that she could hold her own against a comedian like hope. but that's what a trouper does. she was born in 1917 and had an incredibly long career, recently doing voice-over work on shows such as ""family guy."" i had the honor and privilege of appearing three times with phyllis. we were both guest judges on ""last comic standing,"" and we appeared together on ""hollywood squares."" we also were both in the documentary ""the aristocrats,"" the film about the dirtiest joke ever told, proving phyllis was no prude. in the documentary, after they show me performing the joke, they cut to a reaction of phyllis fainting. i felt extremely honored. when i worked with her in recent years, i'll say she looked roughly 1,000 years old, but walked without a cane, was more than totally alert, funny, outspoken and a true pro. she autographed her book for me and gave it to me as a present. i was so touched that i didn't even consider selling it on ebay. recently there were reports of phyllis' declining health. i think she stopped working at that point, or worked less, at least. i don't know if her failing health killed her, or just not being able to perform like she used to. in any case, whenever you watch comedians, male or female, they owe a great debt to phyllis diller. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of gilbert gottfried.",gilbert gottfried: phyllis diller did stand-up when women weren't supposed to be funny

"-- unlike popular period drama ""downton abbey,"" any chatting in ""ripper street"" takes place after a good brawl, in a brothel or over a dead body in the morgue -- not a cup of tea. teeth-jarring fights and the gruesome discovery of a ""ripped tart"" in the shadow-filled streets of london's east end are the first glimpses viewers have of bbc america's new crime drama, all set to the eerie soundtrack of a grating violin. so if your favorite part of ""downton"" is anticipating the war between former co-conspirators thomas barrow and sarah o'brien or mr. bates' violent side, this visceral series might be more your style. set in 1889, ""ripper street"" explores the gritty aftermath of the jack the ripper murders in whitechapel. the h division police force works tirelessly to keep chaos, and even more crime, from overtaking the streets. viewers will see the seedy side of london through three main h division policemen, played by matthew macfadyen (""pride and prejudice,"" ""anna karenina""), jerome flynn (""game of thrones"") and adam rothenberg (""alcatraz""). the eight-part series premieres at 9 p.m. et saturday on bbc america. ""copper"": bringing 1864 new york to life, grit and all series creator and writer richard warlow (""mistresses"") wanted to tap into how the jack the ripper murders still resonate today. his goal, he said, was to show the ways the horrific crimes affected life in london, not to answer the mystery of jack's identity. ""i was more fascinated by the london folklore, and the idea of a very old city like ours having this extra life that these stories give it,"" warlow said. ""real things happen and then they become embedded in the mythic strata of our city. rather than offer any solutions, what we're trying to show is the place where that myth first embedded itself."" he had to draw on a balance of research and his own imagination, creating a universe that feels new even for fans of johnny depp's ""from hell"" or bbc's modern-day series take, ""whitechapel."" in another twist, warlow didn't want to lead the series with well-known scotland yard chief inspector frederick abberline, often the main character in other ripper stories. instead, he chose the real-life boss of h division, inspector edmund reid, played by macfadyen. ""we wanted reid to be a different kind of copper, somebody who was affected by the work he did, but that it didn't make him maudlin. matthew gives you great presence, but at the same time, he gives you such soul, i think. he brings a solid sense of integrity about everything that he does."" abberline is an integral part of the ripper story, so he's included as a supporting character, portrayed ""beautifully"" by clive russell as a man that has been broken by something, warlow said. in the first episode, reid talks about trying to move forward, and while they tried to do everything to find the ripper, all that matters is that the murderer is gone. the ripper is not going to own reid's life anymore. it is one of warlow's favorite scenes. ""that felt powerful, not just for reid, but it was a broader message for the whole show -- we're not going to get ourselves hung up on who jack the ripper is, but really concentrate on the streets that he influenced so much."" immediately after the ripper murders, sensationalism, fear and a desire for normalcy all swirled together in whitechapel. the h division police force's efforts to contain the hysteria is evident in the characters of reid, his right hand man, sgt. bennet drake (flynn) and capt. homer jackson (rothenberg). jackson is an american in the distinctly british show, playing an ex-pinkerton detective that's hiding in whitechapel and living in a brothel, maintaining a contemptuous relationship at best with the madam, long susan. he has a taste for vice and a handy skill with early forensics as a former army surgeon. jackson's character, like the others, is fraught with duality. combined with reid and bennet, their conflict, friction and chemistry creates a compelling dynamic. ""he fits into the story by not fitting in,"" rothenberg said. ""in some ways, he can be a surrogate for the american audience looking at that time and place. at the same time, he represents their perception of america at the time -- he's the wild west."" although he ambles around whitechapel in his brown hat and green jacket with a six-shooter strapped to his waist, it was the mustache (he would never grow one for himself), and warlow's larger-than-life concept of jackson, that made things come alive for rothenberg. ""richard has a way of writing that puts you right there,"" he said. ""i think it's a new voice that people haven't heard written for that time. set design, costuming -- everything was conspiring to make you believe that's where you were."" the crew filmed the entirety of the show in dublin, rather than london, and warlow gives credit to production designer mark geraghty and costume designer lorna mugan for helping create the authentic edgy atmosphere of whitechapel. today, there is little inspiration to be found in the office buildings that now cover the east end's historic streets, with the exception of a stray alleyway or two, but the finished product resembles what warlow and his team imagined. the victorian costuming is elegant, while the streets are cramped and dirty with notorious interludes and crime to be found in every alley. ""it was an insane time, in an insane area -- an intense pressure cooker,"" rothenberg said of the era. while london has evolved immensely from that infamous time, the cloak of its history is still tangible for visitors and residents alike, warlow said. that's what he hopes to capture in ""ripper street."" ""they can get a sense of this city of ours, of london, and of all the kind of the darkness that lies behind its streets and gives the city its flavor -- the history of terrible things but rather wonderful people who have lived here throughout those times.""","""ripper street"" is a gritty new period drama from the bbc"

"(cnn) -- fantasy role-playing takes a staggering step forward as ""dungeons & dragons: daggerdale"" lurches along with uneven visuals and spotty artificial intelligence but a combat system that is easy to learn and even easier to use. the first d&d electronic game (bedlam games, atari) that features use of the new fourth edition rules from wizards of the coast, ""daggerdale"" allows players to create and develop a character from first level, much like the classic tabletop version of d&d. ability scores, hit points, attack and damage rolls are all part of making up your character, but without the use of any dice. there are four base characters: male human fighter, male dwarven cleric, female elven rogue and male halfling wizard. you cannot mix and match: no female elven fighters or male human rogues. each race and class has its own bonuses and class abilities to help perform their actions. the adventure begins in a dwarven mine overrun by goblins. as with any d&d campaign, the story builds from there into a rousing battle with a major enemy at the end. there are major quests that help move the main plot along and minor quests that offer opportunities to earn more gold and experience points. experience points are the backbone of character development, allowing for increased abilities, powers and weapons. only one quest can be tackled at a time. once you start one, you need to complete that mission before moving on to the next. this often results in a lot of back and forth through some of the same areas. gold and weapons can be gathered from fallen enemies or from barrels that seem to be everywhere and in every setting. improved weapons, armor, rings, amulets and potions can also be purchased from local merchants. sounds like a typical d&d game, right? visually, the game conveys the fantasy setting well. the dwarven mine appears foreboding but doesn't quite reach the creepy darkness it could have. a jail also is well-lit when it could have been a better mood-setter with some lighting adjustments. a mini-map in the upper right-hand corner was very helpful in pointing to merchants, non-player characters who might send you on quests and the locations of those quests. a larger map was easily accessible using the character menu. player characters appear different as they don different armor and hold different weapons. enemies look unique from type to type (e.g., a minion looks different from a controller) and can be readily identified by appearance alone. each enemy has a small box above its head that lists out what it is, what level of power it possesses, how many hit points it has and other information. of course, in a traditional tabletop d&d game, these things would be hidden so players wouldn't be able to target weaker foes first in order to whittle down the opposing forces. the information box would sometimes appear if the enemy were hidden around a corner, thus ruining any surprise that could have occurred. there were also instances in which there would be an info box but no enemy. enemy artificial-intelligence was also hit and miss. although the overall tactics of groups of enemies was good (minions charged as their archers and magic-users pinged from afar), they would also stand in place as i lobbed fireball after fireball at them. those battles were less than epic. however, combat was pretty good all in all, and that's where i thought the game shined over its table-top counterpart. i played through the single-player campaign as the halfling wizard, and switching from normal weapons to spells was incredibly easy. all four buttons on the controller can be mapped directly to weapons, spells or potions. there are four more locations that can be used by pressing the left trigger button (xbox 360) or the l2 button (ps3) and then utilizing the standard buttons. spells had cool-down times after casting, so you could either stand there and get pounded or find another way to attack as you powered back up. as i increased in levels, more spells became available so i could fire off spell after spell in a cycle. action was quick and intense. battles didn't last very long against weaker opponents and were appropriately longer against stronger opponents. there are some ""boss"" battles before the final conflict, and those required some use of tactics (run-and-gun) to be successful. my biggest gripe about the game has to do with when those tactics fail and you die. in single-player mode, there are healing potions you can carry with you to regain hit points. there are also clerics in the settlements who will heal you for free. however, there are occasions during a quest when an enemy gets some really good hits in, and, in the heat of battle, you lose track of your hit points, and you die. here is the gripe: no matter what stage you are at in the quest, you have to restart it from the beginning. there are no checkpoints during the quest. there are no ""save and reload"" points other than in between quests. although this is very much like the table-top version of the game (dead is dead, after all), it was insanely frustrating from a video-gaming standpoint. on more than one occasion, i completed a rather lengthy fight, defeated multiple big bad guys and got killed on the way back to the quest-giver (having forgotten to heal myself on the way). this was particularly maddening during the climactic battle, in which you have to defeat multiple high-level characters in rapid succession. get through some but lose in the last one? too bad. if playing with a party of characters is more your speed, there is a co-op mode that allows for up to four players to combine talents toward the common good. the enemies are stronger, and the loot gets better with more people. completing the game's main quests can be done in less than four hours (a good length for a d&d campaign), but doing all the side quests will add some time to your play. overall, ""daggerdale"" was enjoyable but a bit buggy. the story and combat were good and made for an exciting experience. the spotty visuals and enemy ai weighted down the overall fun, but not enough to make me want to stop playing. is it good enough to live up to the d&d name? depends on how much actual roleplaying you like to do. there is little to none to be had here. interactions with other non-player characters happen largely in grunts and subtitles. no dialogue exists other than during cut-scene cinematics. it won't replace your tabletop game, but it might give you some good ideas how to run your next campaign while allowing you some enjoyment along the way. ""dungeons & dragons: daggerdale"" is available now on the pc and through the xbox live arcade and the playstation network. it is rated t for teen. this review was done playing the xbox live arcade version as a halfling wizard in the single-player campaign.","""d&d"" has uneven visuals and spotty artificial intelligence"
"-- research into the h7n9 virus suggests the risk of contracting serious illness rises with age and that more people may be infected than the 105 cases reported, according to a study by the hong kong university. benjamin cowling, associate professor at hku's public health research center, told cnn that a disparity had emerged in data focusing people's exposure to live poultry. ""essentially there are more exposures to poultry in older adults than in younger adults, but the difference in exposures is not as big as when we look at the differences in age of the number of serious h7n9 infections,"" cowling said. he said that if age were not a factor in the seriousness of infection, then researchers could expect the pattern of the disease to exactly match the pattern of exposure. ""what we're seeing is that half the serious cases are above 60 years of age,"" he said. milder symptoms also meant that many more people may be infected with the virus than is currently known because people potentially infected with h7n9 were not seeking medical attention for what seems like a mild cough or fever. read more: bird flu puts spotlight on age-old traditions in china ""one of the reasons that sars was easier to control was because all of the infections were serious so the patients had to be hospitalized and isolated,"" he said.

"-- koh jaeyoul may not work at a powerful south korean media outlet, but the might of his 140 character tweets is considered one of this highly wired country's most influential. koh is better known by his 72,000 twitter followers as dogsul, or 'straight talk' in korean. according to twitoast, dogsul is one of south korea's top 10 power twitterers. one of his consistent discussions lately has been the south korean government's approach to social media users. ""south korea is competing with north korea in trying to control the public,"" koh says. as we talk, koh tweets a question to his followers, asking what they think about south korean president lee myung bak's moves against netizens. the responses vary, from comparisons to china's attempts to control speech on the web, to allegations that the administration is trying to hide information from its citizens. ""people are angry,"" koh says. the anger stems from a number of incidents, including recent indictments against 19 people. the government charged the 19 defendants with sending false text messages under a 50-year-old telecommunications law that states spreading lies with the intent of harming the public interest is punishable by law. the text messages were sent in the wake of north korea's november 23rd attack on the south's yeonpyeong island, which killed two south korean marines and two civilians. the government says the 19 defendants sent text messages stating that south korea had declared war and the military was mobilizing. yesterday, south korea's constitutional court, which has jurisdiction over constitutional review of statutes, complaints and disputes, ruled that the telecommunications law was unconstitutional. the court found the term ""public interest"" too ""unclear and abstract,"" according to the court. the case before the constitutional court was brought by a blogger who in 2009, posted a warning online that the country's foreign reserves would be drained soon because of the government's irresponsible foreign exchange rate policies during the global economic slowdown. the government indicted him with spreading false information online, under the telecommunications law. now that the court has ruled the law unconstitutional, legal watchers are predicting the 19 indicted texters will see their indictments reversed. the ruling comes as president lee myung-bak is stepping up his rhetoric and pushing for a united public opinion from his citizens against pyongyang. in his weekly radio address, lee said, ""to this end, we need to stand together united as one. there can be no difference between you and me when it comes to national security because our lives and the survival of the nation depend on it."" referring to the north wanting the south's citizens to question the government, lee said, ""they are focusing on trying to pull us apart. for this reason, we need to achieve national unity before taking strong military countermeasures. if we show the north koreans how steadfastly united we are, they will not dare challenge us. their intentions will be thwarted. they always have their eyes open to take advantage of any opportunity if they detect any divisiveness in our minds and thoughts."" but koh says the lee administration should harness, not fight social media users.

"-- it's not as fancy as an ipad, but it's far more affordable: kmart's july 25 circular advertised a 7-inch tablet by augen running the android operating system. the gentouch78 is on sale through july 31 for $149.99. that's far less than the cost of a laptop computer, and significantly less than the cost of a typical netbook. it's even less than the up-front cost for many popular carrier-subsidized smartphones -- and it doesn't require a pricey monthly contract. in fact, this device is roughly the size and cost of the wi-fi version of the latest amazon kindle. it's small enough to carry in a purse, and light enough to hold up easily if you're lying down in bed to read. all of this puts the gentouch78 in a very interesting market position. it's a net-enabled tablet that is truly affordable for a mass consumer audience. in this unboxing video, youtube user mrjn7 compares the android tablet to his ipad and notes that while the ipad functions more smoothly and has a more compelling display, you can buy three gentouch78 tablets (and then some) for the price of the least expensive ipad model. this tablet certainly has some shortcomings. according to mrjn7's video, the touchscreen is plastic (not glass) and requires a much firmer touch than the ipad. it even comes with a stylus, which seems like a technological throwback. furthermore, the android operating system may not be as intuitive as the mac os -- although it probably is not more difficult than windows, which has been the choice of cost-conscious computer users for decades. the big deal is: devices like this -- and rest assured, there will be many more of them -- can help address the class biases of technology and bridge the digital divide. tablets like the gentouch could become popular among people who have never owned a computer, or who own a computer and just want light web access on the go. i could see them becoming popular with teens and students, with seniors (who often feel overwhelmed by learning a computer), or anyone who wants more than an e-reader but less than a netbook as long as it's inexpensive. i also could see this kind of device catching on among businesses and organizations where people must walk around while recording or accessing information. i could envision cost-conscious shoppers opting to meet their communication needs via a small wi-fi tablet plus a no-contract, simple-feature phone -- and not feeling left behind by the smartphone craze. i'm sure that some people who are accustomed to laptops and smartphones will scoff at the gentouch78 and its inevitable successors as underpowered cheap toys. that's fine. they're not the target market. the target market, i think, is people who just want good-enough, easy internet access for the lowest cash outlay. that's a big market -- one that probably includes people who wouldn't ever purchase a computer, netbook, or smartphone. the catch, of course, is wi-fi access -- which is still far from ubiquitous in many areas. it's is often available for free at schools, libraries, and many kinds of businesses; but it's a bigger hurdle for people in rural or poor communities. so far, tablets (even the ipad) are mainly intended for media consumption, simple interaction, and light content creation or curating. they aren't good for writing a book, manipulating a big spreadsheet or editing a podcast. but they are good enough to allow considerably more people to do considerably more online, affordably, and with fewer obstacles than most phones present. at the moment, the gentouch78 is not actually on kmart's shelves. the retailer is issuing rain checks for this offer. (see the kmart blog for details.) and it's unknown what kmart's price for the tablet will be after july 31. but remember, this particular product is just a starting point. it'll be interesting to watch this market develop -- and to see how people put these cheap tablets to use.",the gentouch78 is a 7-inch tablet running the android operating system

""although these reports do not provide a complete picture of who exactly was working during the time of the explosion and in the days leading up to it, when combined with the ongoing bp internal investigation that suggests that inattentiveness may have been a contributing factor in the disaster, i have serious questions about whether enough people were working on the night of april 20 to adequately handle the complex operations that were being performed, or if crew fatigue caused by extended shifts may have played a role,"" wrote rahall, d-west virginia, the chairman of the house natural resources committee. rahall called on the company to give his committee more detailed logs and a further explanation of its staffing -- a request transocean said it would meet. but transocean said no worker put in a 24-hour day, and the documents rahall cited didn't tell the whole picture. daily drilling reports track operations and ""certain personnel,"" it said, ""but does not use them to catalog complete crew shifts or the actual hours worked by each crewmember.""

""the vessel was properly and professionally manned; there was no shortage of technical expertise, nor did any crewmember work a 24-hour shift."" cnn was given access to individual time sheets that appear to back up transocean's claim that no employees worked 24-hour shifts on april 14 -- six days before the explosion that eventually sank the rig. and other documents reviewed by cnn seem to indicate that additional salaried workers may have been on the job that don't show up on time sheets, possibly refuting the committee's claim the rig was shortstaffed on april 20. transocean, well owner bp and oilfield services contractor halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster that followed the explosion. the undersea well the rig was drilling has been gushing up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of crude a day into the gulf of mexico since late april. rahall's committee is one of several in both houses of congress to hold hearings into the spill, which now dwarfs 1989's exxon valdez disaster. in addition, a presidential commission and a coast guard-interior department board in louisiana are investigating. bp reported problems controlling the well and won a delay in testing a critical piece of equipment in march, according to documents released in late may. stephen stone, a laborer on the doomed rig, told the house judiciary committee that drilling had to stop four times in three weeks because of the loss of drilling fluid, ""either because the underground formation was unstable or because drilling too quickly caused the formation to crack."" the well was five weeks behind schedule, and some of the survivors have told cnn that bp cut corners and pushed ahead with the well despite safety concerns. in addition, doug brown, the rig's chief mechanic, told the judiciary committee that bp and transocean managers argued over drill plans the day of the explosion and that cuts to deepwater horizon's engineering staff left the crew with a backlog of preventive maintenance to perform.",new: transocean documents appear to refute lawmaker's claims

"-- the storied british soccer team manchester united said tuesday that it plans to raise about $100 million in an initial public offering of its shares in the united states. news reports last year had linked the club, where the england star wayne rooney plays, with a possible listing in singapore. but in a filing with the u.s. securities and exchange commission published tuesday, manchester united said it aimed to sell shares in the homeland of its american owners, the glazer family. the team has one of the most powerful brands in world sport and has won 60 trophies in its 134-year history. but since the glazers, who also own the tampa bay buccaneers, bought the team in 2005, it has accrued a high level of debt. manchester united to sign dortmund's japan star kagawa manchester united said in the filing tuesday that it had generated revenue of 331.4 million pounds ($519 million) in the financial year ended june 2011. but at the end of march this year, its total indebtedness stood at 423.3 million pounds ($663 million). the club said it would use the proceeds from the planned share offering to pay off some of its debt. on the field, the team had an ultimately frustrating 2011-12 season. it lost out on the english premier league title to its local rival, manchester city, on the last day of the season, and failed to qualify from the group stage of the european champions league. the sec filing did not specify when the planned listing would take place. the filing described the maximum offering size of $100 million as ""estimated solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee,"" suggesting it could change in the future. manchester city win premier league title in thrilling finale cnn's jethro mullen and scott spoerry contributed to this report.","the team belongs to the glazer family, who also own the tampa bay buccaneers"
"-- at sunset, the smell of food simmering in dozens of pots starts to fill the air on 15th avenue. soon after, as if summoned by the aroma of meat and spices, a steady stream of cars starts rolling in, pulling up to the food stalls and carts where local women armed with serving spoons prepare to ladle out portions of south african comfort food -- ox tripe known as mogodu, chicken feet, beans and maize dusted with spicy pepper. a woman in a red dress loudly licked her lips as she waited to collect several containers full of food. ""its food from the homeland,"" she said as she then hurried away to her waiting car. ""my husband's going to be very happy."" the neighbourhood that hungry south africans flock to on monday nights is a township called alexandra, or alex. this densely-populated district is often associated with poverty and crime. squatters, many of them immigrants from other sub-saharan countries in africa, live in wretched conditions in shacks and derelict industrial buildings on the edges of the township, and within view of sandton, one of the city's wealthiest, leafy enclaves. twenty-five-year-old maurice modipa wants to change the township's negative image. ""more than anything, i want to put alex on the map,"" he said. ""in terms of getting people into alex and change the stigma that we have, i just want people to see it from my point of view."" modipa and his brothers are transforming their father's small liquor store into a nightclub that they hope will one day offer panoramic views of alexandra township. their bar -- called ""stoep,"" which is a south african term for the veranda where locals gather next to the house -- is part of a larger attempt to attract members of the country's rising black middle class back to the townships. workers at stoep set up amplifiers and haul in cases of beer under the watchful eye of 66-year-old shimmi modipa, who first started selling beer to his friends at this property decades ago, when it was little more than a collection of shacks on 15th avenue. ""i used to call it 'amstel lounge,' because it's where we used to entertain myself, my friends and visitors,"" the elder modipa said. deep inequalities in the days of apartheid, modipa said the white minority-ruled government confined black south africans to the township after dark. he also said it was difficult to start a business, since white-owned banks refused to issue loans to blacks. and though the poverty that is visible today in alexandra reflects the deep income inequalities and high unemployment that continue to plague south africa, modipa said this working class neighborhood has come a long way in the last 20 years. ""there were no tar roads, there were just gravel roads.there were no sewage systems ... in the olden days [we had] bucket systems,"" shimmi modipa said. pointing to the paved road outside his family's bar, modipa said, ""we are still saying thanks, thanks, thanks. my thanks to our papa madiba,"" referring to nelson mandela, the first democratically-elected black president of south africa, who has been lying in critical condition for weeks in a hospital in pretoria. ""mandela made this possible."" by 9pm, loud dance music was blaring from amplifiers in the modipa bar. patrons arrived on roaring motorcycles, in mercedes sedans and expensive sport utility vehicles they swayed to the music in the bar's unfinished open structure, sipping beer and whiskey and munching on chicken feet, apparently oblivious to the winter chill. maurice modipa danced and played dj behind a laptop with big headphones on his ears. the customers who used to drink beer at stoep have changed dramatically in the last decade. ""we know quite a few people who have made something of themselves...economically,"" maurice modipa said later. the scene of affluent south africans returning from wealthy suburbs to the poor township for a taste of their roots was a homecoming of sorts. this uniquely south african night out showed much progress has been made since the end of apartheid, and highlighted how far the country still has to go to overcome its deep social and economic challenges.","in the days of apartheid, black south africans were confined to the township after dark"

"-- yet another passenger ship could be about to anchor in hong kong's popular waters, but berths aboard this particular vessel will be more permanent. new sketches from a company in the city on china's southern coast have proposed the creation of a floating cemetery. designed as a possible solution to hong kong's shortage building space -- particularly for graveyards - bread studio has come up with ""floating eternity."" the structure would hold a rotating wall of 370,000 niches which are compartments allotted for people to place their urn containing the remains of their loved ones. designed like a cruise ship, the floating cemetery would anchor along hong kong's coastline, docking at a designated pier for visitors who want to visit their deceased relatives. ""architects are always made to think about life when designing buildings but not many think about death,"" said benny lee, a designer at bread studio. ""i was watching tv and saw a group of people encouraged by the government to scatter their loved ones' ashes in the sea and noticed that the boat they were using to transport people out was really small. i thought why not make that boat bigger, better and more enjoyable for families."" ""floating eternity"" would also offer amenities for its visitors. complementing chinese rituals that involve bringing food during cemetery visits, the floating cemetery plans to have a grass deck for people to set up picnics or a restaurant onboard. this would be particularly popular during the city's cheung yeung and ching ming festival, where many hong kong residents pay homage to their deceased ancestors by spending their day at cemeteries. ""the design also focuses on plenty of greenery with bamboo gardens; something you don't see in the stony graveyards in hong kong despite them being chiseled into hills because there's simply no space,"" said lee. the structure is also eco-conscious -- its columbarium wall, which would sit on a rail track, would be powered by tidal energy. this allows the walls to travel around the track giving all niches an equal chance for the best position on the cruise; an important aspect of feng shui - the art of placement prominent in chinese culture - where the position of the lot affects the price for it. the concept is bizarre yet, it gives hong kong a glimpse into its near future. with its bay of glitzy skyscrapers and a population of over 7.1 million, space to build is increasingly scarce, and developers are being pushed out of packed central locations. recently, a cbre global research and consulting survey named hong kong the world's most expensive retail space at us$3,863 per sf annum, topping new york. hong kong also has an aging population. according to the hong kong consensus and statistics department in late july, the number of deaths is expected to rise from about 42,700 per year currently to about 82,400 at the end of the next 20 years. a shortage of space coupled with a rise in death rates has caused a shortage of plot space for the deceased and a subsequent rise in costs for it. ""a floating cemetery is the next natural step in hong kong's history of graveyards,"" said lee. cemetery sites have been evolving since the 1940s where the dead were buried in graves on flat land to the 1960s where feng shui dictated that some graves should be positioned on high hillsides near villages. towards the 1980s, columbarium became the preferred place for the dead. traditionally housed in temples, they offer locker-style compartments for people to place the ashes of their loved ones. columbarium also took the form of buildings however, in recent years, people have objected to living in such close proximity to them and their rising prices (private columbaria costs in hong kong range between us$645 to us$25,604). as a result, illegal columbaria have mushroomed in various areas around hong kong. a maritime mortuary is yet to set sail along a coastline in any part of the world. however, there have been other unusual options for storing the dead. in sweden, it is legal to freeze bodies in a posthumous bath of liquid nitrogen before blasting them and reducing them to powder. in tokyo, japan, mechanical tombs are used where families swipe smart cards to lift the urns from an underground vault and access the ashes of their loved ones; a solution hong kong was reportedly looking into three years ago. ""we're aware that the wall of columbarium on the floating cemetery will also, at some point, reach its limit so we suggest stacking up additional storeys on top of the wall,"" said lee. ""but most importantly, it's a short-term alternative. who knows, we could be seeing a sea of floating cemeteries in a few years from now."" world's 'most delightful commute' hit by ferry disaster",new sketches from a company have proposed the creation of a floating cemetery

"-- there has been a lot of chatter in the media lately about hillary clinton's record as secretary of state. and aside from what karl rove says, the right wing's talking point du jour has been that she didn't have one ""signature"" accomplishment. but that couldn't be further from the truth. while she achieved a great deal as our nation's top diplomat, one accomplishment stands out: she restored america's standing in the world. believe me, this was no small feat. think back to 2009 when secretary clinton took office: the united states was engaged in two lengthy, expensive, deadly wars; the previous administration's unilateral foreign policy had alienated our strongest allies; our respect around the world was extremely low; and osama bin laden -- the most wanted man in the world -- was still on the run. we weren't just in a rut; we were in what seemed like a bottomless pit. and we were in desperate need of a strong leader to dig us out. rove criticized for clinton 'brain injury' suggestion that leader was secretary clinton. on day one, clinton began the long, arduous task of shedding the black cloud that had hovered over u.s. foreign policy for nearly a decade. she embarked on a world tour with the goal of repairing diplomatic ties with leaders, restoring america's stature on the global stage, and reinvigorating longstanding friendships. hillary clinton knew that there was ""a lot of damage to repair:"" ""there's a great exhalation of breath going on around the world as people express their appreciation for the new direction that's being set,"" she said. as michael hirsh explained in foreign affairs, ""because of her worldwide popularity and tireless travel -- she set a new record for a secretary of state by visiting 112 countries -- clinton helped undo the damage that the habitual unilateralism of the george w. bush administration had done to the global image of the united states."" secretary clinton was perfectly clear that this was a top priority: ""[i] inherited such a range of problems and deficits across the world that it would be a luxury to say, 'i'm going to focus on this and this alone.'...my big-picture commitment is to restore american leadership, and i think that's about as big a job as you can get. and everything i've done is in furtherance of that."" and there is no doubt that she was successful. a pew research poll found that the opinion of countries all over the world toward the united states has improved dramatically since the tenure of clinton's predecessor. but restoring america's standing in the world not only required repairing relationships with global leaders, it required tackling two colossal tasks left behind from the previous administration -- winding down two wars and bringing osama bin laden to justice. secretary clinton took office eight years after the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on america, yet osama bin laden -- the mastermind of those attacks and leader of the world's most infamous terrorist organization -- had still not been found. clinton supported the raid that finally brought our nation's greatest enemy to justice. secretary clinton's work to restore america's standing in the world paved the way for many of her other major accomplishments and helped bring forward a new era in american diplomacy. clinton: no need for new benghazi committee, but gop 'calls the shots' in the house the israeli-palestinian conflict is one of the most deeply rooted, complex issues of global politics. dealing with this conflict has been high on the agenda of nearly every secretary of state for decades. in november 2012, clinton helped avert an all-out war in gaza by negotiating a cease-fire between israel and palestine. after eight days of violence, as politico noted, ""secretary of state hillary clinton got a gaza cease-fire right at the moment hope seemed dead for a rapid end to the violence."" in today's complex world, where we are not always dealing with predictable actors, one of the single most important thing we can do to protect our great nation -- and our allies -- is to ensure that there are fewer nuclear weapons. as secretary of state, clinton made great strides in countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world. she played a pivotal role in the passage and enactment of the new start treaty, which will reduce key nuclear arsenals to their lowest levels in 50 years. concerned with iran's expanding nuclear program, secretary clinton focused her efforts on building a multinational coalition to impose unprecedented sanctions designed to press iran to comply with its international obligations. through aggressive diplomacy she persuaded countries around the world, including the eu, japan, south korea, canada, and australia to impose sanctions of their own, multiplying the power of our sanctions and the pressure on iran. these sanctions decreased iran's oil exports by more than a million barrels a day -- costing iran nearly $3 billion a month. these are all impressive feats, but hillary clinton's accomplishments don't end there. from establishing the first-ever ambassador for global women's issues to breaking new ground on human rights matters like protecting girls from violence, secretary clinton consistently worked to promote the work of women in the united states and globally. the fact is: clinton's record as secretary of state speaks for itself. and it speaks loud and clear that she was exactly the kind of skilled leader our country needed. join us on facebook.com/cnnopinion.",rep. joe crowley credits hillary clinton for turnaround of america's global standing

(wmo), the ipy hoped to spearhead efforts to better monitor and understand the arctic and antarctic regions. the project had international funding of about us$ 1.2 billion over the two-year period. ""the international polar year 2007/2008 came at a crossroads for the planet's future,"" said michel jarraud, secretary-general of wmo in a press statement. ""the new evidence resulting from polar research will strengthen the scientific basis on which we build future actions."" researchers found that in the arctic during the summers of 2007 and 2008, the minimum extent of year-round sea ice decreased to its lowest level since satellite records began 30 years ago. according to a report published by the ipy organizing committee in february, their research indicates that global warming is affecting antarctica in ways not previously identified. other evidence of climate change came from ipy research vessels that found warming waters in the southern ocean and an increase in melting ice that is creating fresher bottom water around the coast of antarctica. among efforts to study the effects of climate change on antarctica, was anorwegian polar institute project to study marine mammals. custom-designed tags were attached to elephant seals to study the animals' habits, although researcher realized the tags could also help with field research on climate change. the electronic tags -- which fell off when the seals molted -- sent back data on temperature and salinity the oceans around antarctica, particularly around the fimbul ice shelf in east antarctica. while ice-shelf melt has been recorded in the west of antarctica, scientists are concerned that it could happen in the east as well. another project to study the underside of an antarctic glacier deployed an autonomous robot submarine. the team from the u.s. and british antarctic survey sent the ""autosub"" on six missions to study the pine island glacier and how changes in ocean temperature were affecting the west antarctic ice sheet. using sonar, the submarine picked its way around the glacier and sent back data that created three-dimensional maps that scientists used to determine where and how the warmth of the ocean waters was melting the glacier's base. ""if [the west antarctic ice sheet] were to melt completely, global sea levels would rise by as much as 5 meters,"" said stan jacobs, the u.s. lead scientist on the project.

""we believe that it's possible to do all the research that you need to do and understand everything that you need to ... and you don't have to kill them to do it,"" australian environment minister peter garrett told cnn tuesday. japanese foreign ministry spokesman hidenobu sobashima said tuesday that japan's whaling, which has killed up to 1,000 whales in antarctic waters annually, is authorized. ""japan's research whaling is a legal activity,"" he said, noting that the country would continue to explain its perspective in international court. the move toward legal action is ""regrettable,"" sobashima said, when international whale-hunting rules are still being negotiated. the international whaling commission is scheduled to evaluate existing whaling rules at its annual meeting in june. but garrett said diplomatic negotiations over the issues have not produced results. he stressed that taking the case to court does not mean that the relationship between australia and japan -- strong allies and trading partners -- has soured. ""we think we can disagree about one thing and continue to have close relationships across a range of other issues,"" he said. japan's whaling has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocacy groups, who claim it involves the cruel slaughter of whales so that meat can be sold in markets and restaurants. japan's fisheries agency has said that it wants ""sustainable whaling"" and also advocates conservation. ""clearly, the acceptance of other cultures' dietary practices and the promotion of cultural diversity is as important as saving endangered species and the promotion of biological diversity,"" the agency's website says. ""if the consumption of whale meat does not endanger whale species, those who find the practice unacceptable for themselves should not try to impose their view on others."" australia's lawsuit comes as an anti-whaling activist was facing charges including assault and trespassing in a japanese court. prosecutors allege that peter bethune, an environmental activist from new zealand, threw butyric acid at a whaling ship, jumped aboard and attempted to make a citizen's arrest of the captain. bethune has pleaded guilty to all charges accept assault. he testified monday that he did not intend to hurt anyone. a verdict is expected later this month. cnn's yoko wakatsuki contributed to this report.",new: australian official says research possible without killing whales
"-- the u.s. government is being asked to update its 16-year-old cell phone radiation standard to bring it in line with current research and the way people use smartphones. a new government accountability office report on wednesday asked the federal communications commission to consider updating the standard, which limits the amount of radiation a phone emits. the report recommended following an international standard, which would allow u.s. cell phones to emit up to 20% more radiation than currently allowed. the gao also asked the fcc to consider updating its cell phone testing procedures to account for phones being used while next to the body -- such as in a pocket or held in your hand -- rather than only testing how phones emit radiation when held up to your ear. more tech: be careful when diagnosing your ailments online while people still often use cell phones for talking, these devices have evolved into small portable computers and multipurpose tools. it's now common to see people using cell phones as media players kept in a pocket and used with earbuds or a wireless headset, or held in the hand while checking facebook or getting directions from google maps. ""current testing requirements for mobile phones may not identify the maximum radio frequency (rf) energy exposure when tested against the body,"" said the report. ""fcc testing requirements state that mobile phone tests should be conducted with belt-clips and holsters attached to the phone or at a predetermined distance from the body. ""by testing mobile phones only when at a distance from the body, fcc may not be identifying the maximum exposure, since some users may hold a mobile phone directly against the body while in use."" the fcc allows cell phones and other wireless devices to emit up to 1.6 watts per kilogram, averaged over 1 gram of tissue. that's the maximum specific absorption rate (sar), a measurement of the amount of radio frequency energy absorbed into the body -- information that phone manufacturers must provide to u.s. consumers. fcc developed this limit back in 1996, based on input from several federal health and safety agencies. a decade after the fcc published that standard, the institute of electrical and electronics engineers, a global organization that sets standards for electrical devices, published its own recommendation for a maximum sar of 2.0. more tech: couples urged online to 'make a baby' thursday since then the fcc's lower limit has remained in force, which complicates matters for phone manufacturers and may increase costs to consumers. the gao noted: ""maintaining the current u.s. limit may result in additional costs for manufacturers and impact phone design in a way that could limit performance and functionality."" to comply with the fcc's limit, some manufacturers also may have to disable features on phones sold in the u.s., according to the gao. some consumer groups told the gao they don't think the info provided by federal agency websites about mobile phone health effects is sufficiently precautionary. also, some said they'd like the fcc website to mention the world health organization's controversial reclassification last year of radio frequency energy exposure as ""possibly carcinogenic."" the gao looked into the issue of revisiting cell phone radiation standards at the request of three high-ranking congressional democrats: ed markey of massachusetts and anna eshoo and henry waxman of california. more tech: android races past apple in smartphone market share",the fcc is asked wednesday to consider updating its cell phone radiation standard

""he is gone and he is free,"" he said of nakoula, who was bundled up in a coat, hat and white scarf as he was escorted from his house. nakoula decided to cover himself, whitmore told cnn affiliate kcal/kcbs. whitmore earlier dismissed reports that nakoula had been arrested, saying he was never in handcuffs or in custody. karen redmond, a spokeswoman for the administrative office of the u.s. courts, said friday that nakoula's federal probation was under review. redmond didn't provide details of why or when the probation review was initiated, or how long the process would take. while on probation, nakoula can't access computers or any device that can access the internet without approval from his probation officer. nakoula served one year in federal prison at lompoc, california, but officials couldn't immediately determine whether nakoula paid any of the court-ordered restitution of $794,700, according to probation department officials and court records. since notice of the film spread through youtube, nakoula has been out of public view and ensconced with his family in their home in cerritos, california, where journalists have been gathered seeking information about his elusive background. cerritos is about a 20-mile drive southeast of downtown los angeles. the movie, backed by hardcore anti-islam groups in the united states, is a low-budget project that was ignored in the united states when trailers were posted on youtube in july. but after egyptian television aired certain segments, violent protests erupted in egypt, yemen, tunisia, morocco, sudan, iran, iraq, israel and the palestinian territories. violent mobs attacked the u.s. consulate in the libyan city of benghazi, leaving the ambassador and three other american men dead. navy seals among dead the amateurish film portrays the prophet mohammed as a womanizer, buffoon, ruthless killer and child molester. islam categorically forbids any depictions of mohammed, and blasphemy is an incendiary taboo in the muslim world. the fbi contacted the filmmaker this week because of the potential for threats but he is not under investigation, a federal law enforcement official told cnn thursday. one of the few public reports about nakoula emerged this week when he called the los angeles county sheriff's department wednesday night to report a disturbance, said whitmore. nakoula wanted local police to protect him. when news of his movie first broke, the filmmaker identified himself as sam bacile and told the wall street journal that he was a 52-year-old israeli-american real estate developer from california. he said jewish donors had financed his film. but israel's foreign ministry said there was no record of a sam bacile with israeli citizenship. a production staff member who worked on the film in its initial stages told cnn that an entirely different name was filed on the paperwork for the screen actors guild: abenob nakoula bassely. a public records search showed an abanob b. nakoula residing at the same address as nakoula basseley nakoula. he believed the filmmaker was a coptic christian and when the two spoke on the phone during production, the filmmaker said he was in alexandria, egypt, raising money for the film. staff and crew of film that ridiculed muslims say they were 'grossly misled' in egypt, tension has emerged in recent decades between muslims and the minority copts. another staffer who worked on the film said he knew the producer as sam bassil. that's how he signed a personal check to pay staff. when cnn inquired about sam bassil, the u.s. attorney's office sent a copy of a 2009 indictment. those court documents showed the bank fraud conviction for nakoula basseley nakoula. in his interview with the wall street journal, the filmmaker characterized his movie as ""a political effort to call attention to the hypocrisies of islam.""

"-- a reporter from a right-wing media outlet heckled president obama -- not once, but twice -- on friday as he was unveiling a new immigration policy. if this shocks you, you haven't been paying attention. this is simply the latest page from the right's playbook to delegitimize barack obama's presidency. some may dismiss it as an isolated incident, but it's not. it goes much deeper. believe me, i know hecklers -- i'm a stand-up comedian. if someone heckles me once, it can be a mistake: too many drinks, overcome by emotion, etc. but when you heckle twice, you have an agenda. neil munro, the irish born reporter who heckled president obama, was not just from some random publication. he works for the daily caller, a right-wing website whose editor-in-chief is the bow-tie wearing tucker carlson. (you may recall carlson as the guy who famously sparred with â€” and was taken down by -- jon stewart on cnn years ago.) munro's first heckle occurred while president obama was in midsentence, with munro yelling out: ""why do you favor foreigners over americans?"" obama responded: ""excuse me, sir, but it's not time for questions."" munro countered: ""are you going to take questions?"" to which the president answered: ""not while i'm speaking."" later, munro again interrupted the president in midstatement. obama kept his cool; he simply finished his statement. if i had been president, i would have deported munro back to his country of origin. a quick perusal of munro's twitter feed reveals he does not hide his contempt for president obama. his tweets range from claims that obama is using nascar and country music to attract ""white non-college voters,"" to slams of michelle obama, to allegations that obama is racially discriminating against blacks in his white house hiring practices. but this is all not about munro -- he is just a small cog in the right's campaign to diminish the legitimacy of obama's presidency. i'm not talking about people disagreeing with policies. i mean specifically the campaign to paint barack obama as less than american -- as an ""other""--as someone whose presidency is not entitled to the same respect as that of the presidents who came before him. this crusade began in the days before barack obama was even sworn in as president. back then, rush limbaugh, the radio host and self-described ""entertainer,"" announced on his show that he hoped obama would fail as president. obama had not even made his first decision as president. the campaign has continued with the right's birther movement contending that obama was not born in the united states and hence should not be president. some, like evangelical leader franklin graham, have suggested that obama is a muslim (he is a christian), which to many on the right would mean he's not a ""real"" american. we have seen republican rep. joe wilson yell out at president obama, ""you lie"" while obama addressed a joint session of congress in 2009. can anyone remember the last time a u.s. president was called a liar in a joint session of congress? i can't. then there was republican rep. joe walsh, who last july called on president obama to ""quit lying"" in regards to the debt ceiling debate. can anyone remember something like this with previous presidents? i can't either. and, of course, there's donald trump, not only periodically renewing the ""birther"" fabrication, but also demanding to see president obama's college grades, implying he doesn't think obama is intellectually qualified to be president. so you see, munro is just doing his tiny part. and no doubt some on the right will exalt him for his ""courage."" his boss, tucker carlson, defended him by saying that no one was upset when then-abc reporter sam donaldson heckled president reagan. but fox news' chris wallace recalled today that when he was a white house correspondent with donaldson during the reagan administration, no one ever heckled the president. so, yet another lie. but the truth doesn't matter to the far right. it's not about policy or what is good for the united states of america. it's about delegitimizing president obama for political gain. in the coming months, as we get closer to election day, you may see many more of these kinds of attacks. while they may disgust you, they should never surprise you. it's all in the playbook. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dean obeidallah.",dean obeidallah: a reporter from right-wing site heckled obama as he talked about immigration
"-- ""our country has changed,"" wrote chief justice john roberts on june 25, 2013, when five of the nine supreme court justices dismantled the historic voting rights act. roberts is correct in at least one respect: today's republican party is no longer the party of abraham lincoln, as former supreme court justice john paul stevens reminded us again in a recent article in the new york review of books. stevens, a lifelong republican appointed to the court by gerald ford, attacked roberts and his republican colleagues for usurping the authority of congress which had overwhelmingly renewed the act in 2006. but 48 years ago this week, the republican party supported the cause of voting rights. on august 6, 1965, when president lyndon johnson signed the voting rights act into law, he gave the second pen he used to everett dirksen, the republican senate minority leader. dirksen deserved the honor because he was a major architect of the act. in fact, the bill was written in dirksen's office as he sat next to acting attorney general nicholas katzenbach. later, insiders joked that the bill should be called ""dirksenbach."" although suffering from emphysema, ulcers and an enlarged heart, dirksen worked hard defending the bill on the floor of the senate, successfully defeating southern efforts to weaken it. johnson feared that a southern filibuster would delay the bill until the senate adjourned for the summer, a dangerous prospect. ""they been doin' that for 35 years that i been here,"" johnson fumed, ""and i been watchin' 'em do it."" opinion: 50 years later, civil rights struggle is far from over johnson turned to dirksen for help. the senator from illinois persuaded 23 fellow republicans to vote for cloture, shutting off a filibuster and freeing the voting rights act for an up or down vote. when it came, 30 republicans joined 47 democrats to pass the bill and send it to the house for their consideration. after southern efforts to destroy the bill in the house were defeated and differences between house and senate versions of the bill were resolved in conference committee, the 1965 voting rights act was passed overwhelmingly by both houses of congress that august, with republican support. soon, however, republicans began to court white voters in the south and elsewhere who were alienated by the democratic party's embrace of civil rights. richard nixon first adopted this ""southern strategy"" in his 1968 presidential campaign, following the advice of kevin phillips, a political advisor, who later noted that ""the more negroes who register as democrats in the south, the sooner the negrophobe whites will quit the democrats and become republicans."" and so it came to be: blacks, who were affiliated with lincoln's republican party after the civil war and well into the 20th century, moved decisively to join the party of johnson, and later clinton, and obama, while the republican party moved sharply to the right and came to mostly represent white americans. in 2010, after winning control of 25 state legislatures, republicans enacted a series of laws designed to suppress the votes of those who elected barack obama president in 2008. then, on june 25, 2013, the conservative majority on the supreme court bid a final farewell to the party of lincoln by demolishing the voting rights act in shelby county v. holder. troubled by this development, john paul stevens, a republican appointed to the court in 1975 by president gerald ford, offered his dissent in the new york review of books article. justice stevens felt strongly that the court had erred in taking the case, since congress had thoroughly investigated and found evidence of racial discrimination in voting in 2006, resulting in the act's near-unanimous reauthorization that same year. he argued that the chief justice's opinion had failed ""to explain why such a decision should be made by the members of the supreme court,"" and not the congress. after all, the fifteenth amendment to the constitution, which prohibits interference with voting on the basis of race, color, and condition of previous servitude, clearly gives the congress the right to pass legislation to enforce that amendment. ""the members of congress, representing the millions of voters who elected them, are far more likely to evaluate correctly the ...issue...,"" stevens concluded. conservatives on the court were guilty of the judicial activism they had long decried. veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost in a final ironic twist, stevens quoted antonin scalia's dissent in the defense of marriage case, which stevens thought applied at least as well, if not better, to what the court had done in shelby county v. holder: ""we have no power to decide this case. and even if we did, we have no power under the constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation. the court's errors on both points spring forth from the same diseased root: an exalted conception of the role of this institution in america."" stevens' dissent, coming as it does from the man who served longer than any other republican appointee on the supreme court, testifies to how far that party has strayed from its origins. with the gutting of the voting rights act, republicans throughout the south are again passing voter suppression laws (and, in north carolina, legislation which would damage women's reproductive rights). it is no longer the party of lincoln or reagan. it has become the party of jefferson davis. whether the american people wish to turn the clock back to 1861 remains to be seen. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of gary may.","gary may: roberts court gutting voting rights act, recalls that gop no longer party of lincoln"
"-- fallout from a job discrimination lawsuit filed by the head of the immigration and customs enforcement office in new york has led to at least a temporary shakeup at the agency's headquarters in washington. suzanne barr, chief of staff for ice director john morton, voluntarily stepped down this week and is on paid leave because of allegations made against her as part of an ongoing civil suit filed by new york ice chief james hayes. in the suit, which is leveled at the department of homeland security and dhs secretary janet napolitano, hayes claims he was passed over for promotions in favor of less-qualified women, some of whom used to work for napolitano when she was governor of arizona. as part of his lawsuit, hayes cites behavior by barr in an attempt to prove an alleged culture of sexual discrimination against men, according to hayes' lawyer, morris fischer of maryland. in his lawsuit filed in federal court in washington last may, hayes says barr ""created a frat house-type atmosphere that is targeted to humiliate and intimidate male employees."" ice public affairs director brian hale said in a written statement this week that ""ice has referred these allegations to the dhs office of inspector general and the ice office of professional responsibility for review. ms. barr has voluntarily placed herself on leave pending the outcome of this review."" on thursday, dhs filed a motion to dismiss the entire complaint and denied allegations of discrimination and retaliation. its attorneys also argued ""unfounded allegations"" made against barr are ""irrelevant"" and an ""attempt to embarrass or harass senior government officials."" however, a federal official calls the allegations about barr ""serious."" in his lawsuit, hayes also cites dora schriro, who was appointed to serve as special adviser to napolitano on detention and removal, and immigration and customs enforcement; and as director of the office of detention policy and planning. after about a year, schriro left dhs in september 2009 after being recruited to run new york city's department of corrections. hayes claims schriro was not qualified for her dhs appointment because she lacked experience running a federal law enforcement department. previously, schriro served as head of both missouri's and arizona's department of corrections. in the mid 1980's, she was assistant commissioner of corrections. in the lawsuit, hayes blames barr for ""sexually offensive behavior."" in one alleged incident, hayes says barr called a male employee at a hotel and screamed at him using crude language to say she wanted to have sex with him. hayes also states barr moved the office contents of three male employees into a men's bathroom at ice headquarters in 2009. after his client's lawsuit was filed, fischer says he was contacted by other federal employees who heard about hayes' claim. they provided affidavits to hayes and his lawyer alleging more sexually charged comments made by barr, according to fischer. ""we've been getting calls and e-mails from all over the country from people who want to come forward with information that may be helpful on this case,"" fischer told cnn. in an affidavit provided to cnn, another ice employee describes a 2009 meeting in the office of ice director morton during which employees were discussing personal plans for halloween. the male employee says he overheard barr ask a ""senior ice employee"" about the size of his genitals. ""you're a sexy mother-(expletive),"" she allegedly said. over 17 years, hayes rose through the ranks from border patrol agent to a top position at headquarters in charge of detention and removal operations, overseeing a $2.5 billion budget, his lawsuit states. hayes claims he was removed from that job because of gender discrimination. hayes is suing to recover $335,000 in moving costs and lost bonuses he says he incurred when he was transferred to new york in 2009 from washington his lawyer says other ice employees have been reimbursed for similar expenses. his lawsuit also claims he faced retaliation after threatening to file an equal opportunity claim against dhs and cites six internal investigations which were all unfounded. however, all but one of those investigations against him involving complaints by fellow employees were initially filed before napolitano took office in 2008. in his court documents, hayes says the complaints were reviewed after he began complaining. hayes' lawsuit is filled with ""false and unsubstantiated"" allegations against barr and other dhs employees, according to a federal official who defended ice as an agency of ""dedicated law enforcement professionals."" hayes' allegations ""do not align with the fact that mr. hayes has routinely held high-ranking assignments, including his current position as head of ice's second largest field office in new york, the official added. dhs plans to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit before the end of next week, the official said. barr could not be reached for comment. schriro was on vacation thursday, but a spokeswoman for new york mayor michael bloomberg's office issued a statement on her behalf and also praised schriro's work. ""in an arena that has historically been run by men, commissioner schriro is proud to have served a combined 14 years as the first woman director of correction for the states of missouri and arizona. her selection and service at dhs were based on merit,"" samantha levine, deputy press secretary in bloomberg's office, said in the statement. ""(schriro) served with distinction in washington, d.c., and new york city is fortunate to have her as our department of correction commissioner."" hayes declined comment on his lawsuit. his lawyer indicated hayes would like to stay with dhs and issued a statement calling his client a victim of ""frat house behavior."" in the same statement, hayes' lawyer is asking the house subcommittee on oversight, investigations, and management of dhs for a bipartisan investigation. mike rosen, a spokesman for rep. michael mccaul, r-texas, chairman of the subcommittee, called hayes' allegations ""certainly of interest."" in a statement, committee chairman rep. peter king, r-new york, said the committee ""has made no decision to initiate an investigation"" but will monitor the lawsuit. the subcommittee has held five previous hearings on dhs management and leadership.",a discrimination suit was filed by the man who heads ice operations in new york
"dhaka, bangladesh (cnn)at least 13 people are dead and many workers still missing saturday evening after a fire broke out inside a factory in dhaka, bangladesh -- the latest such deadly blaze in the south asian nation. mohammad salimuzzaman, the officer in charge of the police station in the area of the nation's capital were the fire occurred, said authorities had sent at least 13 bodies to a hospital morgue. many of the bodies were disfigured and charred beyond recognition. a short time earlier, dhaka police chief asaduzzaman mia told reporters about the efforts to find others who were in the five-story building. ""the rescuers were still searching for bodies in the debris,"" mia said. such factories -- making products for a number of western retailers -- play a big part in bangladesh's economy, with ready-made garments alone making up 80% of the country's $24 billion in annual exports. the factory that burned saturday was used to make plastic goods. these buildings haven't always proven to be the safest places to work. there are many examples in recent years of fatal factory fires in bangladesh, the most glaring being the spring 2013 collapse of a nine-story building that housed five garment factories. more than 1,100 people died in that blaze. saturday's fire started on the plastic factor's ground floor and immediately and quickly spread, fueled by flammable chemicals in the building, firefighters said. authorities didn't say how many people were in the building when this happened, and thus how many remained unaccounted for. yet some of those escaped -- and there were many -- estimated about 80 or 90 others worked there. afterward, the scene filled with not only firefighters but several thousand onlookers, some of them trying to track down their still-missing relatives. firefighters didn't specify exactly what caused the blaze, though they suspected a busted gas cylinder may be to blame. past factory fires have led to emotional rhetoric from officials, calls for action and, in some cases, criminal charges. thirteen people were found guilty of gross negligence of safety measures and charged with ""culpable homicide"" after a november 2012 apparel factory fire on dhaka's outskirts that killed at least 117 people and spurred others to jump from the building to escape the flames. most of those dead in that blaze were women, almost half of them burned so bad that dna tests were needed to identify them. the building collapse months later in dhaka was even more appalling and exponentially more deadly. that blaze spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers rights in bangladesh. the government responded by revampling laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions, and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5% of their profits toward a workers' welfare fund. the government also boosted minimum wages from $38 to around $68 per month. journalist farid ahmed reported from bangladesh, and cnn's greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta.",a fire breaks out at a plastics factory in bangladesh's capital

"-- the grim stories of two women who endured long-stretches of solitary confinement in iran's most notorious prison are chilling omens for the two jailed u.s. hikers who each reportedly received an eight-year prison sentence on saturday. josh fattal and shane bauer have been abused and assaulted in evin prison, their friend sarah shourd said in a bbc interview in june. evin is noted for its harsh conditions and its wing for political prisoners. ""my worst fear is that they're not safe,"" said shourd, who was arrested with fattal and bauer in july 2009 but was freed for medical reasons in september after 410 days of solitary confinement. the two men were sentenced on charges of spying and illegal entry. shourd said a guard at evin was furious that fattal took extra food and pushed him down the stairs. the guard repeatedly threw bauer -- shourd's fiance -- against a wall of his cell until his head began bleeding. she said the three had feared that they would be executed soon after they were arrested, when a guard began cocking his gun. in july 2009, shourd, fattal, and bauer were hiking in iraq's autonomous kurdish area along the border with iran when they were arrested by iranian police. shourd said they accidentally strayed across the border. iranian authorities say the three crossed into iran illegally. twice, they feared for their lives as guards loaded them into a vehicle to a mysterious location and cocked their weapons, shourd said. terrified, they held hands, cried out and begged for their lives. in september, shourd spoke to cnn's ""american morning"" about her stint at evin, where she was in solitary confinement. she said she got through the ordeal of imprisonment by thinking of her mother and loved ones and ""just knowing i had to come back to them, you know, bruised but unbroken."" as she wept while prison guards slammed the door of her cell and walked away, shourd understood what fattal and bauer were coping with. ""i can see them in their cramped little cell with very little sunlight and they only get out an hour a day and, you know, they exercise side by side on a space like the size of a towel."" asked whether she was physically abused, she said no. ""it is all psychological. and it's just the hardest thing, of course, is being so alienated from your family."" she remembers how she begged to make a phone call, a request that was finally granted seven months into her captivity. ""by the time i got a phone call, i lost hope that it was going to happen,"" she told cnn. ""there's just so many ups and downs. you think it will be over and then it goes on and on and on."" american journalist roxana saberi also spent time in solitary confinement at evin and spent hours thinking: is it going to ever end? ""i felt anger toward god, as well. i said, 'why are you punishing me? why don't you save me?'"" saberi told cnn's ""american morning"" in september. she was sentenced to eight years in prison but was released after 100 days in may 2009. she said the ordeal was a hard one. ""when you're alone, you feel helpless. you might feel hopeless. at first you might be in a state of denial. you ask or tell yourself: 'i can't accept this. it is just a nightmare. it is going to end.'"" saberi never knew whether she would be able to speak with her lawyer or when she might see her parents again. she spent her 32nd birthday in jail, in the midst of a hunger strike. she chose to stop eating because her body was the only thing she could control. it was her only weapon against the regime. the iranians promised her freedom if she would admit she was a spy. they threatened her to keep her silent about her time in evin. saberi said she was threatened by her captors if she spoke about ""certain things."" one guard told her he would sign her death warrant. she said they told her: ""i think you've seen how capable we are. we have agents all over the world and we can find you anywhere. you might be reporting in afghanistan and we can kill you and make it look like you died in a car accident.""","iran's evin prison has a reputation as a dismal, dangerous place"
"-- a giant panda at the san diego zoo gave birth to a cub the size of a stick of butter on wednesday, her fifth cub born in the zoo since 1999. the public can view live video of the cub and its mother, bai yun, on the zoo's web site. the sex of the mostly hairless, pink newborn, which was born around 5 a.m., is not known yet, said dr. ron swaisgood of the zoo's institute of conservation research. it will take about one month for the iconic black-and-white coloration of the giant panda to become visible, swaisgood said. its mother, bai yun, will care for the newborn by herself until she starts leaving the den regularly, at which time members of the zoo's giant panda team will step in briefly to check on the cub, he said. ""she is a very experienced mother. she raised all of her other cubs until about 1.5 years, the natural age for separation,"" swaisgood told cnn radio. ""she's a real pro."" weighing in around 300 pounds, bai yun is about 1,000 times the size of her cub, who weighs around 4 ounces., the typical size of a baby panda, swaisgood said. ""pandas give birth to what's called very 'altricial' cubs. that means they are very small and fragile. this cub would probably weigh about 4 ounces. it would be pink and hairless and completely dependent on the mother,"" he said. the birth is considered a success for the zoo's institute for conservation research, which works with research and breeding centers around the world to boost the endangered panda population herself a model of that effort, bai yun was the first panda to be born and survive at the breeding center of the china center for research and conservation of the giant panda in the wolong nature reserve in 1991. she has given birth to four other cubs since arriving at the san diego zoo in 1996 from china. two of them have since been returned to china, swaisgood said. the newborn's father, gao gao, is a wild-born giant panda that arrived at the san diego zoo in 2003 from the wolong nature reserve. he will not be involved in raising the cub. the cub will remain in the den with its mother for a few months and gradually start to come out as soon as it is able to walk, swaisgood said. in four to five months, the cub will be ready for the public, swaisgood said. until then, the public can view live video of the cub and its mother on the zoo's web site. ""this highly endangered species still requires a lot of attention and assistance, but there is hope for the future,"" he said.",giant panda bai yun gives birth to fifth cub at the san diego zoo
"(ew.com) -- universal pictures just turned valentine's day 2015 into a sure thing for millions of men. the studio is moving its release date for the movie adaptation of the erotic romance fifty shades of grey out of next summer and onto valentine's day weekend 2015, turning what was sure to be a girls night out event into an epic date night. the news, reported exclusively in this week's ew cover story, comes on the heels of the studio's announcement that it has pushed the start of production in vancouver back a month to allow for the production to prep with its new leading man, northern irish actor jamie dornan, who plays kinky billionaire christian grey. but, universal says, the casting change is not the primary reason for the new release date. ew: e l james launches 'fifty shades of grey' wine more pressing is the crowded summer schedule fifty shades was originally competing in. originally set to hit screens august 1, 2014, the film, based on the sexy best-seller by e l james, was set to go up opposite marvel's potential new franchise guardians of the galaxy starring chris pratt and benicio del toro. internationally things are even busier, with many studios pushing their big tentpoles out of next june and july — to avoid competition from the world cup in brazil — and into august. ""we see this movie as a global event,"" universal pictures chairman donna langley tells ew. ""the strength of this book is really worldwide, so we want to be able to take advantage of women who are invariably on vacation with their families during the month of august in europe."" now the film will debut on valentine's day weekend, beginning on friday, february 13, which also coincides with the president's day holiday, giving universal the opportunity to post a big three-day number for that frame. langley, who was instrumental in bringing the fifty shades franchise to the studio, adds that universal would likely have made the change even if charlie hunnam, the original actor cast as christian grey, had not dropped out in mid-october. ""together with the international marketing and distribution team, we've been looking really closely at the august date and becoming more and more convinced that the right thing to do for the movie was to push it,"" langley says. ""so even if charlie had stayed, we still would have been making the date change."" ew: see the full 'fifty shades' coverage the film's new date will put it up against the adaptation of nicholas sparks' the longest ride, which has yet to begin production or hire a cast. who knows, maybe the fear of competing with fifty shades will keep it away. for more on fifty shades of grey, including exclusive interviews with author e l james, director sam taylor-johnson, and the full story behind the casting of christian and anastasia — plus which scenes from the book have made it into the script, and which have already hit the cutting-room floor — pick up this week's issue of entertainment weekly, on stands friday. see the original story at ew.com. click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. all rights reserved.","the studio is moving its release date for ""fifty shades of grey"""
"-- it is always important to look back on historical moments in history and remember how it was and reflect on those who made it possible. but it is also vital to continue having a forward-looking vision that connects the past with the present. when veterans of the civil rights movement and those who weren't even alive in the 1960s pick a date and gather in washington to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the march on washington for jobs and freedom, a lot will be said about the past. rep. john lewis of georgia is the only surviving speaker on the official part of the program, and others who witnessed the speech are older and grayer but still among us. it must have been an unbelievable sight to see about 250,000 people before the lincoln memorial to gather for jobs and freedom for african-americans on august 28, 1963. we remember the march because of the massive audience as well as the culmination of that day, the riveting speech of the rev. martin luther king jr., who delivered what is known today as the ""i have a dream"" speech. during that moment in history, the heavy hand of jim crow was oppressive for african-americans all across america but especially for those living under the brutality in the south. voting was virtually nonexistent. blacks couldn't eat in public places like hotels and restaurants. but what the march largely focused on was the economic condition of african-americans. when most folks think about the march, too much focus is on the ""i have a dream"" portion of king's speech and not the top two-thirds, which was a condemnation of the economic policies that stifled black growth in america. ""one hundred years later, the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination,"" king said. ""one hundred years later, the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. one hundred years later, the negro is still languishing in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land. and so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition."" what many people forget is that in the final year of his life, king was planning the poor people's campaign, looking to focus the nation on its poorest citizens. king confidant harry belafonte told me last year for an interview on my tv one show, ""washington watch,"" that king understood that black america, and all americans, couldn't be truly free unless they had economic freedom. a lot has changed for black america since august 28, 1963, but when you examine the economic condition in 2013, we are still facing troubled times. as america has desperately tried to escape the recession that gripped the world over the past few years, black unemployment remains pathetically high. overall, the unemployment rate announced in march was 7.7%. for african-americans, it was 13.8%. black teen unemployment was 43.1%. the wealth gap between whites and blacks is even wider today than it has been in three decades. according to a recent report (pdf) released by brandeis university, the wealth gap between whites and black increased from $85,000 to $236,500 between 1984 and 2009. the median net worth of white families is now $265,000, and it's $28,500 for black families. the brandeis study says there are five vital factors for this: number of years owning a home, average family income, college education, employment stability, and financial support from families and inheritance. many will read this and say, ""oh, please! get an education, find a good job, work hard, and all will be well."" but it's not as simple as that. when you look at the state of education where african-americans largely live, resources play a crucial role in all of this. the lack of a quality education plays a role in what college you're able to attend, and that will determine what kind of job you will have. the long-term racial policies of america have also played a role. the failure of black families being able to go to college for decades in the 20th century, as well as access to good-paying jobs, has played a role in the inability of blacks to pass down wealth from one generation to another. all of these factors are why a commemoration of the 1963 march on washington for jobs and freedom shouldn't be a big love-fest for folks focused on civil rights. it should be singularly focused on driving an agenda that speaks to the unemployment crisis afflicting black america. those who are planning events around the march shouldn't fall into the easy trap of letting any and everyone bring their agenda in august. the beauty of the 1963 march is that it was narrow, specific and designed to address a critical need. if organizers today want to really walk in the footsteps of those in 1963, they should go back and study why they all met in the first place. the agenda was set in 1963 on jobs and income inequality. in 2013, this generation should pick up that baton and run with it so that the next time there is a commemoration, we will be celebrating how successful we were in addressing and fixing the problem. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of roland martin.",roland martin: the 50th anniversary of the march on washington is coming up
"-- tuesday's election in the littlest of states is causing the biggest of stirs. when president barack obama hits the campaign trail here friday to lend his star power to jorge elorza, the first-time candidate running in the city's deadlocked mayoral race, he won't be the most famous politician in the ocean state that day. that distinction belongs to the politician running against elorza, the larger than life man who's never lost a political race, the man who served as providence's mayor twice before -- and who was forced to resign each time in disgrace: buddy cianci. ""you're not going to get a pulitzer prize or an emmy by saying 'buddy cianci is a convicted felon.' cianci told cnn at his providence headquarters this week. ""everybody knows that."" he added: ""i'm probably the most vetted candidate in america right now. they know everything about me."" cianci, a back-slapping machine politician reminiscent of a bygone era, served as the city's mayor from 1975 to 1984 and then again from 1991 to 2002, epochs recalled locally as buddy i and buddy ii. buddy i came crashing down after cianci was convicted of using a fire log and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his wife. buddy ii ended after cianci was convicted on federal corruption charges. at the end of his 2002 trial, the judge rebuked cianci before sentencing him to federal prison for five years. ""in this mayor's two administrations, there has been more corruption in the city of providence than in the history of this state,"" said judge ernest torres. cianci isn't shying away from his past. ""i've made mistakes in my life obviously, i've paid the price,"" he told cnn. ""we all stumble, i stumbled. that doesn't prevent me from running for office...i've done my time, and i think i'm a contributing member to this society and this city."" while cianci's stumbles didn't prevent him from running for office, his 37-year-old opponent hopes that they'll prevent him from capturing it. ""we have a storied history of corruption here in our city,"" elorza said at a recent press conference. ""and those incidents of corruption are very well-documented in mr. cianci's administration."" three former u.s. attorneys -- among them current u.s. sen. sheldon whitehouse -- doubled down on those sentiments, urging voters to reject cianci at a press conference they convened october 14. ""i would very much doubt that the return of this particular shadow would do our applications any good,"" said whitehouse, referring to federal grant applications. but for buddy, it's a familiar refrain. in fact, it's cianci's past -- warts and all -- that lay at the heart of the campaign message driving the 73-year-old's ""final rodeo"" -- the quest for a buddy iii. ""they can talk all they want about me and my background,"" he said. ""the question is: if you went into a hospital and you had to have open heart surgery, would you want the intern to do it or would you want the experienced doctor even though the doctor might have had a couple of problems in his life? everyone in providence it seems has an opinion about cianci, and they typically fall into one of three categories. there are those that love him, such as sandra perrone. ""i think of him as a robin hood."" she told cnn. ""i just think he should be given another chance."" there are those that don't. ""buddy cianci is someone who's very flashy,"" said joshua shockly. ""i think it's all show with him, there's not any substance behind what he does."" then there are the conflicted. cianci ""is someone who is incredibly charming, actually very intelligent, very funny, (and) very glib,"" said kent mallard. ""but somebody who i would never vote for for mayor."" ""i think buddy cianci loves this city and that he did some good things for this city,"" added shockly. ""i just don't think this city needs somebody like him at this point in time where providence and rhode island in general needs to take a step forward out of a past which has really kept us kind of behind everyone else."" that even cianci's detractors concede that there is much to like and admire about the man reveals the underlying conflict facing voters in the city of nearly 180,000 as they head to the polls on tuesday: do they go with the candidate with a shadowy past but who nevertheless worked tirelessly to bring a once blighted, ne'er do well city out from those very shadows? or do they go with the less experienced and younger elorza, a candidate who obama -- a politician who knows a little something about being young and inexperienced and running for office -- says will ""will bring honest leadership to providence?"" ""a lot of positive things happened while (buddy) was in office but a lot of negative things happened,"" said resident dennis emsley. ""i mean, he's a celebrity, he has a certain cache, but there are other candidates that are more connected to what's going on in the city today and that are going to be more able to lead the city into the future and i don't think that'd be buddy cianci."" as for any other celebrity -- presidential or otherwise -- campaigning against a buddy iii, cianci says his opponent can have them.

"-- the preliminary results of a referendum on an independent southern sudan will be announced in the next few days, with final results as early as february 7, the national commission that organized the vote said tuesday, the south sudan referendum commission (ssrc), which was formed last year by president omar al-bashir, said the preliminary results will be announced saturday in juba in southern sudan and on february 2 in khartoum, sudan's capital. ""if there is no appeal, the final results will be announced on february 7,"" said justice chan reec madut, deputy chairman of the commission. ""but if there is an appeal or appeals, they have to be discussed, and the final announcement will then be on february 14."" south sudanese voted in a weeklong referendum in early january on whether to form an independent state. preliminary results show 99% voted for independence with most of the count in the south completed. the commission faced three challenges during the referendum process: the legal aspect of the referendum itself, time and finances, according to commission chairman muhammad khalil. ""in these kinds of situations, where there are political negotiations, there is a lot of give and take,"" khalil said, ""and this reflected on the law."" ""the law itself was framed in an unclear way with much repetition. ... it was shaky,"" he said. nevertheless, khalil said, the referendum commission, which includes southern sudanese and northern sudanese members, worked easily together, ""making decisions in accord."" khalil said the commission did not have much time to conduct its work. ""it was conceived by those who signed the comprehensive peace agreement (cpa) that the referendum process would take 42 months,"" he said. ""by the time the referendum commission was established, we had four months."" the referendum on whether to declare independence from the government based in the north is part of a 2005 peace agreement that helped end a two-decade-long war. the war pitted a government dominated by arab muslims in northern sudan against black christians or animists in the south. the conflict left about 2 million people dead. funding was also a challenge for the referendum, khalil said. ""the international funding was generous but not made available for sudanese expertise,"" he said. ""if we had more funding, we would have included more sudanese experts to give the referendum an added national face."" both the federal government of sudan and the government of south sudan had committed themselves to funding the referendum with 400 million sudanese pounds (about $160 million), khalil said, but the commission only received 26.6 million sdg in the north, and 60 million sdg in the south. madut also pointed to ""logistical difficulties"" in the south during the referendum. ""we used human porters who delivered material on their heads to transport the materials and kits to the counties."" however, madut said, the high turnout was historical. ""it is something that has never happened in sudan; in fact some say it never happened anywhere."" madut said once the counting is done, the rest will be up to the politicians. issues such as borders, the future of the oil-rich border district of abyei, citizenship rights and how to manage international debts are yet to be resolved. ""we were able to finish in five months what was supposed to be done in three years,"" he said. ""so unless we are told to come back ... we we would like to take a beautiful vacation.""",the south sudan referendum commission was formed last year
"a man slips behind someone else into a packed elementary school with an ak-47-type weapon. he goes into the office and shoots at the ground, then darts between there and outside to fire at approaching police. so what do you do? if you're antoinette tuff, who works in the front office at ronald e. mcnair discovery learning academy just outside atlanta, you don't run. you talk. you divulge your personal struggles to the gunman, you tell him you love him, you even proactively offer to walk outside with him to surrender so police won't shoot. and then the nightmare ends with the suspect, later identified as michael brandon hill, taken into custody and no one inside or outside the decatur school even hurt, despite the gunfire. ""let me tell you something, babe,"" tuff tells the dispatcher, kendra mccray, at the end of the dramatic 911 call that recounts her minutes of valor and terror. ""i've never been so scared in all the days of my life. oh, jesus."" this brief outburst of emotion, moments after police entered the school tuesday, was in stark contrast to her cool, calm demeanor as heard earlier on that 911 call. as a go-between, she relayed his demands that police refrain from using their radios and ""stop all movement,"" or else the suspect would shoot. ""he doesn't want the kids, he wants the police, so back off,"" she said in the call. ""what else, sir? he said he don't care if he die, he don't have nothing to live for, and he said he's not mentally stable."" by the end -- with police themselves having never directly talked to him -- tuff and the gunman were talking about where he would put his weapon, how he'd empty his pockets and where he'd lie down before authorities could get him. ""it's going to be all right, sweetie,"" she tells hill at one point in the call. ""i just want you to know i love you, though, ok? and i'm proud of you. that's a good thing that you're just giving up and don't worry about it. we all go through something in life."" tuff then let the gunman know that she'd been down before herself, but she'd picked herself up. he could, too. ""i thought the same thing, you know, i tried to commit suicide last year after my husband left me,"" she said. ""but look at me now. i'm still working and everything is ok."" that day, for everyone at that school, everything did turn out ok. shots were fired, but no one got hurt. the gunman never made it to the classroom area, deciding instead to give up and lay down. this ending is thanks largely to tuff, said mccray, the woman who fielded her 911 call. echoing president barack obama -- who called tuff on thursday to thank her -- and many others, mccray described tuff as a ""true hero"" for being courageous, calm and personable. ""you did a great job,"" mccray said, shortly after the two met in person for the first time thursday for an exclusive interview with cnn's anderson cooper. ""you made my job a lot easier."" tuff, others 'thought it was a drill' tuff had training in how to deal with such a scenario. school staff regularly train for dangerous situations involving trespassers and emergency protocol, school district spokesman quinn hudson said. tuff and two other staff members -- a cafeteria manager and a media specialist -- were specifically trained in hostile situations. ""the training is so often and extensive, they thought it was a drill"" at first, said hudson. while tuff worked to keep the gunman calm and spoke with him, she signaled a code to her two counterparts, who immediately triggered a phone tree to tell teachers to lock doors and send children to safety, hudson said. ""her name, antoinette tuff, says everything about her,"" said brian bolden, the school principal. ""tough. she has always been that way, from the first time i met her."" he describes her as a strong leader whose authority everyone respects. the past eight years, tuff has been with the georgia school -- the past three at mcnair. and she almost wasn't there tuesday. tuff was scheduled to be off that day, but because of a shift change, she ended up right where the school needed her to be. the school's existing safety procedures will remain the same while the investigation takes place, bolden said. but he promised any needed changes will happen. ""we will do everything humanly possible in our power to keep this next generation of learners safe."" counseling was made available to the kids, and the school understands that some children might not be ready to come back right away, he said. inside the suspect's mind on wednesday night, hill, 20, was in a georgia jail awaiting a still undetermined initial court appearance. authorities are still hammering out exactly what charges he will face. police spokeswoman mekka parish has said they would include aggravated assault on a police officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. ray davis, the lead detective on the case, added that false imprisonment and ""several weapons charges"" probably will be included as well. whenever the charges come down, hill will waive his initial court appearance, said claudia saari, public defender for the stone mountain judicial circuit. she said members of her office's mental health division are handling his case and declined to make any further comment. this week's incident is not hill's first run-in with the law. he has a criminal history in dekalb and neighboring henry county that, while not ""lengthy,"" does include violence, davis said. specifically, hill pleaded guilty in july to making ""terroristic threats and acts"" against his brother. georgia school shooting suspect was arrested in march henry county court records show that, in addition to three years of probation, he was ordered to attend anger management classes. but that county's district attorney, james wright, said wednesday that there's no indication that hill completed them. as to any connection to mcnair discovery learning academy, why he might have gone into it armed, and what he planned to do once there, authorities have not outlined a motive or a detailed plan. being from dekalb county, hill ""possibly had been there (at the school) before speaking with some people in the administration,"" davis said. but ""there's no indication he had a grievance with the school."" before he entered the school, the suspect took a picture of himself with the assault rifle -- which he'd taken ""from the house of an acquaintance,"" said davis, who did not say whether the weapon was stolen. so did hill go in intent on killing people? davis responded: ""i believe there was something else, but i don't want to go into detail."" some clues about his mindset are evident in the dramatic 911 call. with tuff acting as the intermediary on the call, the suspect said that ""he should have just went to the mental hospital instead of doing this, because he's not on his medication."" chief: it 'absolutely' could have been 'another sandy hook' while tuff seemingly kept her cool inside the school, a swarm of law enforcement was springing into action outside. police reacted ""very, very quickly"" -- including some officers who took up positions with long rifles -- ""to engage the threat"" and prepare for the worst, said alexander, the dekalb county police chief.

"-- the atlanta hawks organization's issues with race go beyond one inflammatory email or offensive comments on one conference call, the team's ceo said, before promising fans that those systemic problems will be corrected. ""as an organization, we must own these shortcomings and failures,"" steve koonin wrote in an open letter saturday to his team, fans and the city of atlanta. ""... we should build bridges through basketball, not divide our community or serve as a source of pain."" koonin's comments come a day after general manager danny ferry began an indefinite leave of absence tied to controversial comments he made in june about luol deng, then a prospective free agent player. and they occurred six days after the franchise's owner, bruce levenson, announced he would sell his controlling interest team in light of a 2012 email that many derided as racist. in the same announcement last sunday setting the stage for levenson's exit, the nba said that koonin will oversee team operations during the ownership transition. the hawks ceo did not mention levenson or ferry specifically in his letter saturday, nor did he delve into detail into their or possible other cases. but he did say that ""we enough today, based on investigations conducted by the league, by external legal counsel on behalf of the team and information that has appeared in the media, that our shortcomings are beyond a single email, a single person or a single event. ""to the contrary, over a period of years, we have found that there have been inflammatory words, phrases, inferences and innuendos about race,"" koonin said. ""we as an organization did not correct these failures. we did not do the right thing."" koonin then laid out four key steps aimed at addressing the issue: koonin ended his letter with an appeal to rally around the team's players, rather than abandon them out of frustration. ""we ask our fans to continue to support our players as we all learn through this process -- we should not punish them,"" he said. ""we aim to win as a collective team both on and off the court."" ceo: incidents 'put a blemish on our team and our city' the issue of race, and the prospect of alienating african-americans, takes on added significance in atlanta, given its history and makeup. the home of the rev. martin luther king jr. and other civil rights leaders, atlanta was one of the few large southern cities not to see major race-related disruptions during the 1960s as it earned the reputation as ""the city too busy to hate."" today, atlanta is led by a black mayor in kasim reed and its population is 54% african-american, according to the u.s. census bureau. all but a handful of players on the hawks roster are black. in the 2012 email to ferry that led to his giving up the team, levenson estimated african-americans made up 70% of those attending hawks games and 90% of those in the philips arena bars. he said, too, that the team's cheerleaders were black and hip-hop, rap and gospel music was likely to be heard in the arena. ""then i start looking around at other arenas. it is completely different. even (washington) dc with its affluent black community never has more than a 15 pct black audience,"" levenson wrote. the hawks' controlling owner then offered his thoughts on why more whites didn't attend games: ""my theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a significant season ticket base. ""i never felt uncomfortable, but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority."" levenson then outlined steps to take, like asking for more ""music familiar to a 40 year old white guy"" and that camera shots and ""the kiss cam"" don't focus as much on black fans. he said changes had shifted the crowd makeup, by his estimates, to 40% african-american as of 2012. still, levenson insisted that african-americans' lack of ""spendable income"" and whites being uncomfortable in an arena with many blacks was still ""far and away the number one reason our season ticket base is so low."" hawks owner to sell team after racially charged email the comments that led to ferry's going on leave weren't directed at african-american fans, but one black player in particular -- former chicago bulls and current miami heat forward luol deng. in a june conference call discussing free agent options, ferry said that deng (who was born in south sudan) was ""not perfect. he's got some african in him,"" according to audio obtained by the atlanta journal-constitution. he also characterizes deng as ""a two-faced liar and cheat"" who is ""like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back.,"" according to a letter about the comments to levenson written by j. michael gearon jr., a minority owner of the hawks. ferry has apologized, saying he was ""repeating"" words prepared by others. the audio of the call and a copy of the scouting report shows similarities, though ferry did not read word-for-word from the report. hawks gm on leave over controversial comments koonin, in his letter saturday, acknowledged that these and other, similar examples aren't acceptable, especially in atlanta.

""most of us believe that the decision as to major reform of how americans get their health care in this country deserves at least as much time and deliberation as it would take to select a puppy to live in the white house,"" he said.

"-- for one of the farthest, coldest places in the solar system, pluto sure stirs a lot of hot emotions right here on earth. this montage of images taken by voyager shows, from left to right, neptune, uranus, saturn and jupiter. it was three years ago monday that the international astronomical union demoted pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, a decision that made jaws drop around the world. an outcry followed, textbooks had to be rewritten, long-held beliefs were shattered, and many people felt our cosmic neighborhood just didn't seem the same with eight -- instead of nine --planets in the solar system. today, debate still rages over how to classify the little celestial body, along with others orbiting the sun, but the iau stands by its definition. ""i think that most of the astronomical community has come to terms with the fact that we now know that the solar system has a continuous distribution of objects from very large down to very small,"" said lars lindberg christensen, a spokesman for the iau. ""we now know that what we call the different objects has to necessarily change with time."" don't tell that to plutophiles still seething about the decision. some are even taking action. earlier this year, the illinois senate adopted a resolution declaring that pluto was ""unfairly downgraded"" and restoring ""full planetary status"" to the celestial body as it ""passes overhead through illinois' night skies."" it also designated march 13, 2009, as ""pluto day"" in honor of the date that its discovery was announced in 1930. (in case you are wondering why the state is so passionate about pluto: clyde tombaugh, who discovered the planet-now-dwarf-planet, was born in illinois.) meanwhile, new mexico's house of representatives proclaimed february 18, 2009, as ""pluto is a planet in new mexico day"" and praised tombaugh, who worked in the state for decades and died there in 1997. passionate about pluto don't live in those states and want to make your voice heard? you can order ""plutophile"" bumper stickers to proclaim your firm support for pluto, print out a pluto fan club card -- which allows you to declare, ""in my heart, pluto will always be a planet"" -- or sign an online petition. christensen said 90 percent of the critical e-mails and letters the iau received after its decision in 2006 came from north america. astrophysicist neil degrasse tyson, director of new york city's hayden planetarium and author of ""the pluto files,"" believes there are two reasons why americans are so engaged in the issue. ""disney's dog pluto was sketched the same year the cosmic object was discovered. and pluto was discovered by an american. so here you have a recipe for americans falling in love with a planet that really is just a tiny ice ball,"" tyson told time magazine. still, astronomers are divided about the best way to classify pluto. see photos of other planets and find out what makes them stand out » at the heart of the matter lies the question: what makes a planet in the solar system? according to the iau's definition, it must orbit the sun, it must be big enough for gravity to crush it into a nearly round shape, and it must clear the neighborhood around its orbit. in other words, it must be dominant enough to clear away objects in its orbital space, according to nasa. this last point is what proved to be pluto's demise as a planet: there are other competing objects in its orbit. crowded solar system? some scientists say that part of the definition doesn't make sense. ""it's kind of like, i'm going to tell you what your car is on the basis of how the traffic around you is behaving,"" said mark sykes, director of the planetary science institute. the more logical way to classify planets is the geophysical definition, which simply states that planets are round objects that orbit the sun, sykes argues. the objects must still be big enough so that gravity crushes them into a ball. ""the problem with the geophysical definition is we might have a couple of dozen planets in the solar system as more are discovered in the distant reaches,"" sykes said. he believes the international astronomical union's definition won't stick around after nasa spacecraft reach pluto and ceres, a texas-size asteroid in an orbit between mars and jupiter that is now also classified as a dwarf planet. ""i think [the iau's definition] is going to collapse by 2015 when the dawn mission gets to ceres and the new horizons mission gets to pluto because we're not going to see irregular-shaped, impact crater-filled, boring surfaces. we're going to see dynamic worlds,"" sykes said. the iau's decision also came under fire because only 4 percent of its scientists participated in the vote that reclassified pluto. but christensen said the iau was following its statutes and bylaws and has passed other resolutions in a similar way. the subject of pluto didn't come up at the iau's general assembly earlier this month in rio de janeiro, brazil, christensen added. sykes countered that astronomers wanted to discuss the issue, just as they have at other recent major meetings, but the iau didn't allow there to be any sessions on planet classification. ""i think the iau did a terrible disservice to science, because it gives the public the impression that science is done by votes,"" sykes said. ""and that's not the way science is done at all.""",international astronomical union demoted pluto to a dwarf planet three years ago

"the chair, perhaps the most famous chair in political history, stands in the office of a large, nondescript cement building just a stone's throw away from the u.s. capitol. that's right, the chair clint eastwood used as a prop in his rambling and at times incoherent critique of president barack obama at the republican national convention is now one of the many pieces of political memorabilia in reince priebus' spacious office on first street in washington. the chairman of the republican national committee gets the joke; the chair is the first thing he points out to a reporter before sitting down behind his desk to discuss how his party must dramatically rethink its strategy and message in hopes of recovering from the national drubbing of 2012. the second collector's item he shows off is a yellow foam cheesehead autographed by green bay packers quarterback aaron rodgers. it reads: ""to reince, from one qb to another, best wishes! aaron rodgers."" rodgers might be on to something. as rnc chairman, priebus isn't calling the plays: that's up to house republican leadership and the ambitious gop governors roaming state capitols around the country. but he is reading the other team and making crucial adjustments to the game plan. priebus is also the general manager, responsible for helping build the team and manage the expectations of ownership. and he has many owners to answer to: 168 republicans who make up the national committee, deep-pocketed donors who write the checks, grass-roots activists who provide conservative energy, and the lawmakers who have an immediate personal stake in the party's success. boehner says obama's focus is to 'annihilate the republican party' a two-tiered goal to restructure, rebrand gop that's why priebus is developing a political plan he hopes, in the near term, will re-energize his party in time for the 2014 midterm elections, while also developing a long-term strategy to compete among key demographic voting blocs -- hispanic, asian, african-american -- that broke so heavily democratic in november. to hear priebus tell it, the goal is two-tiered: restructure the party on a tactical level to match the sophisticated and data-driven efforts of the obama campaign, and create a communications plan to sell the gop's message to voters it failed to connect with in 2012. gop's surprising edge on diversity it's an overwhelming task and it's going to cost money, lots of money. ""i've been meeting with donors since the election in november,"" priebus said. ""i would say i am pleasantly surprised how quickly the donors who have given so much are ready to build a party that is a year-round operation."" bennett: gop, play offense in obama's second term as he reflected on the presidential race, it quickly became clear that one of the most bothersome aspects of the presidential race was the marathon debate schedule. the primary debates were a point of frustration for some republicans, who felt the process was controlled by the news media, not the party, in the past election. ""i believe that no. 1, we have to control the debates,"" priebus said. ""i think that having over 20 debates is too many, and i think we ought to regulate the debates, pick the moderators and get involved in setting the calendar."" priebus cautioned his comments are not set in stone and he described his ideas in ""hypothetical"" terms. one idea he mentioned was instituting a penalty system in which candidates for the nomination would lose a percentage of delegates if they participated in a debate not sanctioned by the rnc. dark horse candidates hungry for media attention would likely oppose such a move, but it's unclear if they would have the power to prevent a change in the rules. the idea of handpicking moderators would also face stiff opposition from the media organizations who foot the bill to stage and broadcast the debates. primary calendar needs to be condensed as for the primary calendar, priebus said he would like to see it condensed to allow the eventual gop nominee more time to prepare for the general election. in an ideal world, he said, the intra-party fight would start later and finish sooner, with the republican national convention possibly being held as early as june. but he doesn't talk about changing the order of the four leadoff primary and caucus states -- iowa, new hampshire, nevada and south carolina -- that have traditionally kicked off the nomination process. ""i think that the carve-out states have served us well, but i think the timing of the calendar and the rest of the calendar issue should be looked at,"" he said. priebus rejected the notion of the rnc becoming involved in presidential primaries to assist the strongest candidate, but he was quick to point out that state republican parties can choose to play in primaries if they want. ""state parties can decide for themselves,"" he said. ""it's their choice."" in terms of outreach to minorities, priebus said the gop failed to pass a very basic test. attracting minority voters a key gop goal as obama begins second term ""well, for one thing, we have to ask for the vote,"" he said. ""you have to ask for it and i don't think that we've been doing a very good job of that."" priebus said a glaring organizational flaw for republicans is that there have been no long-term investments made in human capital to help sell the gop message on a neighborhood to neighborhood level. it's more than just having an outreach director in a state -- it's having dedicated, full-time staffers on a grass-roots level to run ""voter registration, hold community events, go to swearing-in ceremonies ... having real job descriptions for lots and lots of people on a yearlong basis in communities that move the dial."" the party's standing among hispanics emerged as a damaging sore spot last year for national republicans, who were forced to answer for hard-line immigration positions from prominent conservative figures, including their own presidential nominee. obama won with 71% of the hispanic vote, according to cnn national exit polls. outreach to hispanics has already begun, priebus says ""i think you are seeing a lot of movement from our party on these issues,"" said priebus, who said outreach has already begun. ""a lot of it, i tell you, was tone. you know, it wasn't necessarily the policy on immigration, it was what is coming out of your mouth."" he specifically mentioned a comment by republican presidential nominee mitt romney, who suggested illegal immigrants might ""self-deport"" and leave the country willingly. ""when you talk about stuff of self-deportation, it is probably not the best place to start,"" priebus said. still, priebus said he believes that republicans, not democrats, better represent the ideals and goals of all voters, including minorities who turned out in droves to re-elect the president. priebus plans to explain his vision for the overhaul of his party in more detail to the 168 rnc members who arrive in charlotte, north carolina, this week for a three-day meeting that will focus almost entirely on this subject. five republican heavyweights -- henry barbour, sally bradshaw, ari fleischer, zori fonalledas and glenn mccall -- are helping priebus craft the recovery plan, dubbed ""the growth and opportunity project."" just as obama asked democrats to nominate him as their presidential nominee in charlotte in september, priebus will ask rnc members on friday to elect him to another two-year term. it will be more of a formality than an election, because priebus has only token opposition and has locked down enough support to maintain his role as chairman. ""both the grass-roots and the donors have to be on the same page, and i think i am in a unique position to do that,"" he said. priebus predicts a more 'granular' approach for gop priebus is in a unique position because of his financial stewardship of the national committee, which two years ago was saddled with nearly $25 million in debt after the departure of controversial former rnc chairman michael steele. ""our money situation here was so bad that both credit cards were suspended when i walked in the door,"" he said. ""so when we went to go book travel or anything like that, we didn't have a credit card to put the travel on. fortunately, we had my two credit cards, so we maxed out both of those cards."" priebus estimated he spent $40,000 to $50,000 on his personal credit cards, which he was eventually reimbursed. dialing for dollars became priebus' priority, a tough task for a depressed donor base that saw super pacs and the congressional campaign committees as viable alternatives to the poorly managed rnc. when he started as chairman, priebus said there were fewer than 100 major rnc donors, people who contributed more than $15,000 per year. by the close of his first year, he said 1,000 people were donating $30,000-plus each year. paperwork filed with the federal election commission showed the rnc ended 2012 with about $3.3 million in the bank and no debt. unlike two years ago, priebus won't have to use his own credit card to pay for his plane ticket to charlotte. now the big question is whether he will be able to raise enough money to transform the party, and if he can, will his fellow republicans embrace his plan?","reince priebus, who engineered turnaround in gop's finances, is up for re-election"

"-- one of the unintended consequences of the arab revolutions has become evident in israel, where a surge in the number of refugees from africa has created new tensions in a country with no shortage of practical and ethical dilemmas. in the face of the new challenge, a number of israeli politicians have sunk to the occasion, exploiting raw emotions and fueling a display of violence that should shame israelis. to be sure, israel is not the first nation whose handling of illegal immigration deserves criticism. but the anti-immigrant riot that took place in a tel aviv neighborhood on may 23 should rise as a rallying cry for israelis who believe their country should shine as a ""light unto the nations."" since egyptian president hosni mubarak was overthrown last year, egypt's sinai peninsula, the border between the two countries, has become a mostly lawless land where bedouin gangs freely traffic in, among other things, human beings. migrants who come mostly from sudan and eritrea have chosen israel as their destination because it is one of the most prosperous states in the region and because it offers some protection for refugees. despite the protests of right-wing politicians and of some sectors of the population, israel has so far refrained from forcing the vast majority of refugees to return to their native countries. many countries keep asylum-seekers in prison-like camps under indefinite detention. israel is building a detention facility where refugees would remain while their cases are processed. but until now, they have been receiving visas that allow them to live anywhere in the country. still, they live in limbo without a right to work legally. unlike other countries that have returned refugees to their nation of origin or pushed them back to the state from which they crossed the border, israel, a signatory to the 1951 refugee convention, has done neither. but the situation is becoming untenable and pressure for deportations is growing. government figures say about 60,000 african migrants now reside in israel, double the figure from 2010, with between 2,000 and 3,000 more arriving each month. the numbers are enormous for a country the size of israel. it is roughly equal to the number of illegal immigrants found, for example, in australia, a country 350 times the size and triple the population of israel. israel is hardly the first place to experience anti-immigrant riots. and anti-immigrant sentiment there is part of a wave sweeping the globe. as in most places where illegal immigration has suddenly increased, much resentment has come from the poor who see the unfamiliar new arrivals settling in their midst, view the newcomers as a threat to their livelihoods and are highly sensitive to reports of criminal activity. eritrean and sudanese refugees have been arrested in a number of rape and stabbing of cases in tel aviv, but there is no evidence that the crime rate among them is higher than in the rest of the population. that, however, has not stopped interior minister eli yishai from tarring migrants as criminals and suggesting that most should be summarily deported. the country's leaders should seek to calm tensions and find a humane solution to a growing human problem. but responsible, statesman-like behavior is apparently too much to ask. when the residents of the south tel aviv neighborhood of hatikva held a protest last week, one member of parliament, miri regev, referred to sudanese ""infiltrators"" as ""a cancer,"" stoking the inexcusable outbreak of violence. (she later apologized for using the term ""cancer"".) another member of parliament, danny danon, turned up the rhetoric, shouting ""expulsion now!"" and calling the migrants ""a plague."" while some israelis expressed sympathy for the protesters, many lashed out against the shocking display of intolerance in tel aviv, of all places, a city known for its open-mindedness. although no one was seriously injured and the police intervened, arresting 17 people, the language and the behavior would be unacceptable anywhere, but in israel more than anywhere. reuven rivlin, speaker of the knesset, the israeli parliament, characterized the event as reminiscent of the early days of world war ii, saying the words ""remind me of the hate speech aimed against the jewish people."" prime minister benjamin netanyahu declared ""there is no place for the statements and actions which we saw last night."" the day after the riot, israelis held a vigil against racism in front of the prime minister's residence. but the reaction on the political scene was not uniformly conciliatory, with new calls for deportations and more irresponsible and inflammatory language from some political leaders. israel faces a serious moral and practical dilemma. and although the problem has unique aspects because it is occurring in israel, it is a quandary familiar to every country that has faced a large inflow of refugees and migrant workers. in israel's case, the prospect that the stream of refugees could grow into a flood raises the added specter that it could transform the jewish character of the state. despite netanyahu's claim, that is not an imminent danger. but the question also tugs, urgently, at another aspect of the country's identity. israel, after all, was founded as the nation-state of the jewish people; a people that saw millions of its numbers murdered while other countries closed their doors during world war ii and at other times in history. israel has not dealt with its refugees more harshly than most countries, despite the exaggerated claims about the events in tel aviv. but that is not a good enough standard. israelis need to deal fairly and humanely with the refugees. israelis are building a barrier at the sinai border, which should cut down on the smugglers' cruel traffic in human beings. israel should formalize and legalize the status of a portion of the migrants and work with international agencies to find homes in third countries for others. in the meantime, it's a good time for israelis of all stripes to look at their own history and send a strong message to politicians who seem to have forgotten not only the country's claim to high ethical standards, but an admonition from an ancient text, from exodus, recently cited by a hospital manager writing about the serious medical needs of african migrants.

"editor's note: the staff at cnn.com has been intrigued by the journalism of vice, an independent media company and web site based in brooklyn, new york. motherboard.tv is vice's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology. the reports, which are being produced solely by vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our cnn.com readers. brooklyn, new york (motherboard.tv) -- geneva may have given the world precision watches, but its biggest contribution to humanity is a giant time machine. buried beneath the swiss countryside and stretching across the border to france, the large hadron collider isn't just any science experiment. the underground particle racetrack is present-day summation of questions about matter -- really, our entire puzzle-like understanding of the natural world -- that humans began to ask over a millennia ago. but it goes back much further than that. as it smashes trillions of protons together at near the speed of light in the hopes of breaking them apart to see what they're made of, the lhc takes us back to the moments just after the birth of the universe. nearly a year after the proton beams were successfully circulated in the main ring of the collider, the project's overseer, the european organization for nuclear research, or cern, invited motherboard.tv to come by for a visit. in interviews with the research students and their bosses, including lyn evans, the project manager, we learned all about the $9 billion machine that's 17 miles in circumference and straddles the border of switzerland and france. it's arguably the fastest racetrack in the universe, able to create things like quark-gluon plasma and, if theory holds up, the higgs boson, the so-called holy grail of particle physics. that might help explain why protons and neutrons weigh 100 times more than the quarks they're made of, what dark matter is, and how the universe came to exist. but we weren't satisfied with merely a visit to the most intricate machine ever built. we also wanted to clear the air about something that had been bothering us, in a few different ways -- the imminent collapse of earth. that's at least the theory of people like otto rossler, a professor of biochemistry at the university of tubigen. he argues that cern's proton collisions could generate dangerous miniature black holes. these won't necessarily bring about the end of the world -- there's just a one-in-six chance. this kind of planetary russian roulette, rossler says, ""is a risk you musn't take."" while at least two separate scientific panels have certified the safety of the project, the doomsday theory has gained traction on the internet, where, laments cern spokesman james gillies, ""many sensible, intelligent and rational people have been unnecessarily worried by some some completely baseless speculation."" rossler's theory, meanwhile, has been met in kind from another left field - holger bech nielsen's simultaneously serious and funny proposition that the many technical problems that have plagued the lhc are the work of a time-traveling higgs boson particle, hell-bent on preventing us from ever finding it, lest we say, opening up some sort of fundamental particle pandora's box. this wonderfully absurd theory doesn't stand up, according to cern researchers, at least not since they observed cosmic rays with energies equal to and much higher than the lhc. says gillies, ""if he were right, we would not see such rays."" watch ""big bangs and black holes"" at motherboard.tv still, technical issues have dotted the project's history over its decades of construction and scant three years of operation. everything from electrical failures to minor explosions have given the project's leaders, not to mention thousands of scientists around the world, a bit of indigestion. at the end of 2012, the experiment will be shut down for a 15-month upgrade, which became necessary after a nearly catastrophic accident in 2008 that cut the collider's design energy in half. but the scientists have little to complain about. it's not often that the stars align to allow for a project of this magnitude, and nothing this complex has ever been built before. it could have happened here. during the 1980s, american physicists looked with a fevered hope to a giant construction site in texas, where the department of energy was building the superconducting supercollider, a particle accelerator intended to be the last word, for a few years at least, on particle physics research. but funding for the project was cut in the early 1990s, and today the giant tunnels built for the project lie fallow. it was a missed opportunity for the united states, says physicist neil de grasse tyson. ""here's this huge project, and we would have led the field in this subject, and now we just stand on the shores looking across the pond to switzerland as europe leads the way."" scientific competitiveness aside, the large hadron collider is a truly international project, built in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries. to process the data collected by the collider's six particle detectors and distribute it to researchers around the world, cern relies on another of its inventions. in 1990, cern physicist tim berners-lee, created the world wide web. today, the lab is developing a new approach to distributed computing it calls the grid. (no relation to ""tron"" -- yet.) the aim is to make internet access to computing resources -- cpu and storage -- as accessible to users as the web makes access to information. the web has also been crucial in generating public interest in the large hadron collider, with an assist, of course, from a strong marketing push. cern has sought connections with hollywood (the collider played a starring role in ron howard's version of dan brown's ""angels and demons"") and the arts (the lab has established an artist-in-residence program). ""we have been working for many years to build up cern's public profile,"" says gillies, ""seeing the lhc as a unique opportunity to raise the profile of science in general."" as for the absurd theories, he says, ""we've had to build the buzz surrounding the more fanciful ideas into our communication strategies."" even if the popular fascination with the collider may sometimes stray into science fiction, it has made made its research not only the object of popular fascination, but a cause of inspiration too. in that way, the project isn't just looking for the higgs. it's helping humanity examine practically everything.",2011 marks 100th anniversary of discovery of atomic nucleus
"-- the united states has ""deep concerns"" over china's newly declared east china sea air defense zone, vice president joe biden privately told chinese president xi jinping during his visit to beijing on wednesday, according to a pool report citing senior administration officials traveling with the delegation. according to the pool account of a background briefing by the officials, biden also told xi that the united states doesn't recognize the zone -- which includes uninhabited islands that have been the site of tense disputes between china and japan, both of which claim the lands for their own. ""president xi was equally clear in laying out their view of the zone and of territorials disputes in the region,"" one of the officials said, according to the pool report. ""ultimately, president xi took on board what the vice president said. it's up to china, and we'll see how things will unfold in the coming days and weeks."" biden had assured japanese leaders on tuesday that he would raise the issue with xi, but it was not mentioned publicly by either leader. in public remarks welcoming biden that betrayed no hint of the tensions, xi called the former senator an ""old friend"" and praised u.s.-china relations. ""we're happy to see that in the recent period, our two teams have worked actively to expand coordination and collaboration on bilateral, regional, and global levels,"" president xi said in greeting biden on his latest visit to china, according to a pool report. biden also made no public mention of the controversial chinese air defense space declaration, instead focusing on the possibilities of good relations between the two nations. he cited discussions between xi and president barack obama this summer seeking a ""new model"" in relations between the countries as china seeks to expand its influence worldwide and as the u.s. pivots its attention from the middle east to asia. ""as we've discussed in the past, this new model of major-country cooperation ultimately has to be based on trust, and a positive notion about the motive of one another,"" biden said. ""the relationship that you and president obama have established thus far is full of promise, and real opportunity for us,"" biden told xi, according to a pool report. ""if we get this relationship right with a genuine new model, the possibilities are limitless,"" he said. asia trip gives biden chance to show off diplomatic cred but in a sign the two leaders had much to talk about privately, a scheduled 45-minute private session between xi and biden ran two hours. the meeting covered ""every single topic in the u.s.-china relationship,"" including economic issues and north korea, said one of the u.s. officials who were briefing reporters . ""they talked at some length about what the iran example means for north korea,"" the official said, referring to the recently reached deal between iran and a coalition of international powers to curb the middle eastern nation's nuclear program. the official was referring to how the international community came together to pressure iran to reach a deal, according to the pool report. biden's visit to china comes about two weeks after china declared an air defense zone over a portion of the east china sea, including island territories that china and japan each claim. the dispute over the islands has led to tense situations between ships and planes from the two countries over the past year, raising concerns that an incident in china's newly declared defense zone could spiral out of control. it has also fueled concern among u.s. officials about how far china is willing to go to pursue its interests in the asia-pacific region and push back against u.s. influence. china is asking aircraft entering its air defense zone to identify themselves and submit flight plans. it says the zone is similar to others maintained by nations around the world, saying that it is not asserting territorial control over the airspace and that legitimate commercial traffic will continue to move through the region unhindered. china's declaration prompted pushback from the united states and other nations in the region, which rejected the zone and continued to route military flights through the area. japan has told its commercial airlines not to comply with the new chinese demands, but the u.s. government has urged american carriers to follow beijing's instructions. on tuesday, biden assured japanese leaders that he would press china over the issue. ""we, the united states, are deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the east china sea,"" biden said at a news conference alongside japanese prime minister shinzo abe on tuesday. ""i will be raising these concerns with great specificity directly when i meet with the chinese leadership,"" biden said. biden promises to press china on airspace dispute u.s. state department spokeswoman jennifer psaki reiterated this week that washington does not recognize the air defense zone or china's demand to be notified of plans by jets from other nations to fly into the area. the chinese action, biden said, raises the possibility of ""accidents and miscalculation."" in a statement tuesday, a spokesman for china's defense ministry said the zone is one of ""safety, not risks, a zone of cooperation, not competition."" without naming the united states, spokesman geng yansheng, warned countries about becoming involved in china's dispute with japan. ""other parties concerned should also mind their words and actions, and should not do things to undermine regional stability and bilateral relations,"" he said. ""other parties should not be incited, or send wrong signals to make a very few countries go further on the wrong track, which will follow the same old disastrous road and undermine regional and world peace."" china's air defense zone: what you need to know cnn's jethro mullen and steve brusk contributed to this report.","new: biden, chinese leader xi talk about air defense zone, north korea, pool report says"
"-- nfl player richie incognito wants an expedited hearing on his suspension from the miami dolphins so he can return to the field soon. incognito filed a ""non-injury grievance"" against the dolphins, who suspended him for conduct detrimental to the team earlier this month, according to the nfl players association. incognito said in an interview last weekend that his alleged bullying of miami dolphin teammate jonathan martin is misunderstood because ""people don't know how jon and i communicate to one another."" martin, 24, left the team last month because of ""harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing,"" martin's lawyer said. days later, incognito, 30, was suspended. ""the grievance challenges his suspension for conduct which was alleged to have occurred while he was with the club,"" the association's statement said. ""in the grievance, incognito requests that the hearing be held on an expedited basis so that he can immediately resume playing for the team."" the dolphins declined cnn's request for comment on the filing. ""our organizational policy is not to comment on grievance matters,"" a team spokesman said. dolphins owner: ""we need to look at ourselves"" the nfl appointed veteran lawyer ted wells to investigate the controversy surrounding martin's departure and incognito's suspension. miami dolphins owner stephen ross said he called for the independent investigation by the nfl because he knew the objectivity of a team investigation could be questioned. ""we need to look at ourselves,"" ross said. ""we have to examine everything internally. i know that this is so appalling to me."" but ross also said he wanted to avoid overreacting. he formed a committee to help guide the changes, including former dolphin coach don shula and quarterback dan marino. ""we all know that the football locker room is a different workplace than most of us are accustomed to,"" ross said. ""basically, i don't want to make any excuses. i want to know that our workplace going onward will be the best workplace that you can find in the nfl."" incognito acknowledged in an interview aired on ""fox nfl sunday"" that he used racist and vulgar language in voice mails and text messages to martin but said it was ""coming from a place of love."" ""no matter how bad and how vulgar it sounds, that's how we communicate,"" he told fox sports reporter jay glazer. ""that's how our friendship was."" ""for instance, a week before this went down, jonathan martin text me on my phone 'i will murder your whole f-ing family,'"" incognito told glazer. ""now, do i think jonathan martin was going to murder my family? not one bit."" dolphins owner delays meeting with jonathan martin while martin has not spoken publicly since the controversy erupted, his attorney david cornwell broke the silence on his behalf with a prepared statement last week. martin tried ""to befriend ... teammates who subjected him to the abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment"" -- something cornwell called ""a textbook reaction of victims of bullying."" the taunting did not stop, however, the lawyer said. he cited ""a malicious physical attack on him by a teammate and daily vulgar comments,"" and a threat of a group sexual assault against martin's sister. ""eventually, jonathan made a difficult choice,"" cornwell said of martin leaving the dolphins. ""... jonathan looks forward to getting back to playing football. in the meantime, he will cooperate fully with the nfl investigation."" ""the face of bullying in america"" ""right, wrong or indifferent, because of all this, you've become the face of bullying in america,"" glazer told incognito. ""someone thinks of a bully, they think of richie incognito."" ""this isn't an issue about bullying,"" incognito said. ""this is an issue of my and jon's relationship, where i've taken stuff too far, and i didn't know it was hurting him."" a profanity-filled voice mail from incognito to martin that has been made public was intended to shock him so ""his buddy"" would call him back, he said.

"-- on the eve of the nobel peace prize award ceremony in oslo, norway, cnn.com and cnn international are among the websites and television networks that have been blocked in mainland china. the winner of the prize is imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo. what's going on? cnn's beijing bureau chief jaime florcruz offers some insight. q: there are reports that users in china can't access the cnn website and the websites of other news organizations. what's the situation in beijing and across mainland china? a: cnn.com is completely blocked as of today. because when i use [a privately secured network] the site works ok. but if i'm using the normal broadband connection at home, that most chinese have, an error message comes up. it says ""this website is not available."" it's sort of the standard thing that happens when a website is blocked here in china. q: is television news also blocked? a: every time our reports are broadcast about nobel prize winner [liu, who is serving an 11-year sentence in a chinese prison for what the government called ""inciting subversion of state power""] the television screens black out. we are required to beam our signal through a chinese satellite station before it is broadcast to mainland china. that creates a 12-second delay. authorities use that time to black out specific parts of the signal. whenever anything about wikileaks or the nobel prize is mentioned, the signal is blocked. q: how common is this? a: they've been doing this many years. usually anything having to do with the ""three ts and one f"" -- tibet, taiwan, the '89 tiananmen square protests, and falun gong, a spiritual group banned in china. the process had abated for the last several months, and especially right after the olympics. but in recent weeks we've noticed the practice has become more frequent. but now when anything about the nobel prize or wikileaks as it pertains to china is reported, our stories are blacked out. q: does this occur only in mainland china, or is it in hong kong as well? a: i believe it's just mainland china, that's what they can control. q: how do chinese authorities police this? a: they watch our stories and read our stories very closely. they probably have written directives over what kinds of stories need to be censored. i doubt that people pushing the buttons know english very well. but they probably base it on certain video they see, or key words that they hear. i think it's emblematic of how tightly controlled this is, and how sensitive authorities are about tomorrow's award ceremony in oslo. q: what are the chinese sites saying about the nobel prize, if anything? a: the authorities are also blocking certain websites that may be touching on this or wikileaks. i think it's safe to say that most chinese are not aware of the [nobel peace prize winner]. and whatever they may have read about him has been through official talking points and state commentary. an update on the blackout from jaime florcruz as of 0830 gmt friday: we have canvassed a few chinese people -- students, functionaries, a homemaker, a filmmaker -- and have asked them to try to click on the cnn website using their regular broadband connections at home or in school. they tell us that the international edition of cnn.com is totally blocked. when they log on to cnn.com's u.s. edition, it loads fine until they click on any liu xiaobo-related stories and they get the standard notice: ""this website is not accessible.""",cnn.com is currently blocked in mainland china
"(mental floss) -- 1. applebee's the world's largest casual dining chain celebrated 30 years of eatin' good in the neighborhood in 2010. the original applebee's, which was named t.j. applebee's rx for edibles & elixirs, opened in atlanta in 1980. the founders of the original restaurant, including bill and t.j. palmer, wanted to name the restaurant appleby's, but that spelling had already been registered. cinnamon's and peppers, two other names considered, were taken as well. the palmers settled on t.j. applebee's, which was just different enough from their first choice. ""menu items ranging from munchies to steak and quail are served at round, high-topped tables on platforms,"" read one newspaper review from 1981. a second location was opened in atlanta before t.j. palmer's ownership group sold the restaurant concept in 1983. the name was changed to applebee's neighborhood bar & grill in 1986 and became the first casual dining chain to hit 1,000 locations in 1998. 2. bob evans bob evans began producing sausage on his farm in 1948 for a 12-stool diner he owned in southeastern ohio. his patrons raved about the sausage, prompting evans to enter the sausage-making business on a larger scale. bob evans farms was launched in 1953, and when the number of visitors to his farm began to increase, evans saw an opportunity. evans opened a small restaurant called the sausage shop in front of his brick farmhouse in rio grande, ohio, in 1962. the sausage shop is considered the first of bob evans' now-famous chain restaurants. today, evans' farmhouse, known as the homestead, is on the national register of historic places. 3. california pizza kitchen in 1985, federal prosecutors rick rosenfield and larry flax opened the first california pizza kitchen in beverly hills. rosenfield and flax, who were inspired by wolfgang puck's popular spago restaurant in west hollywood and hired puck's original pizza chef at cpk, read ray kroc's autobiography prior to starting their business. today, the chain has grown to more than 250 restaurants. mental floss: why mr. rogers was the best neighbor ever 4. cheesecake factory in 1972, oscar and evelyn overton moved from detroit to a suburb of los angeles to launch a wholesale bakery specializing in cheesecakes. six years later, the overton's son, david, opened a salad and sandwich shop in beverly hills that featured 10 flavors of his mom's cheesecake. one of the main purposes of the shop was to get local restaurateurs to carry the overton's cheesecake in their own establishments, but it turned into a booming business of its own. overton opened a second restaurant in marina del rey in 1983. the rest was history. 5. cracker barrel in 1969, dan evins, who worked in his family's gasoline business, opened the first cracker barrel old country store off highway 109 in lebanon, tennessee. by 1977, 13 additional cracker barrel stores had opened. the goal of the original cracker barrel was to provide a place for motorists to fill their tanks and their stomachs, and the inspiration for the concept came from the general stores that evins frequented as a child. according to the cracker barrel website, goods such as crackers were shipped to these stores in barrels, and when the barrels were empty, the base was often used for a checkerboard. the gift shop remains a staple of cracker barrels today. 6. denny's harold butler founded denny's in lakewood, calif., in 1953 as danny's donuts. first-year earnings totaled $120,000. butler opened 20 additional shops and expanded the menu to include sandwiches and other entrees over the next six years before renaming his restaurants denny's. butler began franchising denny's in 1963 and introduced its signature grand slam breakfast in atlanta in 1977. in 2000, denny's opened a restaurant in rhode island, which was the only state without one. mental floss: how do you decaffeinate coffee? 7. ihop the first ihop was opened by brothers al and jerry lapin on july 7, 1958, in toluca lake, california. part of the reason the lapins chose toluca lake was to capitalize on the overflow crowd from bob's big boy. al lapin had operated a series of coffee carts in los angeles when fast-food chains started to take off and saw the potential for a fast-food restaurant that specialized in breakfast. today, ihop boasts more than 1,500 restaurants in all 50 states. ihop purchased applebee's in 2007. 8. red lobster bill darden opened the first red lobster in lakeland, florida, in 1968. the restaurant, which offered seafood at reasonable prices, was popular from the start and darden soon opened four additional locations throughout florida. in 1970, general mills purchased darden's chain. the original restaurant was closed in 1997 after darden determined that lakeland would be better served by only one location. red lobster wasn't the first color/animal restaurant darden started. decades earlier, he opened the green frog. 9. tgi friday's alan stillman opened the first t.g.i. friday's at first avenue and 63rd st. in new york city in 1965 -- partially as a means of meeting airline stewardesses. ""the other thing is that my timing was exquisite, because i opened t.g.i. friday's the exact year the pill was invented,"" stillman told the new city reader last year. ""i happened to hit the sexual revolution on the head, and the result was that, without really intending it, i became the founder of the first singles bar."" the first friday's featured tiffany lamps, sawdust on the floor, and distinctive red and white striped awnings. first year revenues at the original friday's were $1 million. a second location opened in memphis in 1970, and within 10 years, eight other t.g.i. friday's had opened. stillman eventually sold friday's and launched smith and wollensky steakhouse in 1977. mental floss: who was the first stewardess? 10. waffle house the original waffle house opened on labor day 1955 on east college avenue in decatur, georgia. in 2008, the 13-stool diner that launched more than 1,500 waffle houses reopened as a waffle house museum, with vintage equipment and memorabilia displays of old uniforms and place settings.

"-- it takes a disaster to remind us how much we depend on our local and state governments. in the middle of a presidential campaign, hurricane sandy has put barack obama and mitt romney on the sidelines, reminding us how much we count on mayors and governors to protect us, to rescue us and to keep our streets, buses, subways, airports and commuter rails running. after a season of debates about the deficit, taxes and health care, americans have discovered that they cannot survive without government: to provide clean water, reliable transportation systems, and emergency services when floods, fires and power outages force them to abandon their homes. hurricane sandy even demonstrated that sometimes politicians should do more than what we want, especially when they are trying to save us from ourselves. when new jersey gov. chris christie ordered everyone out of atlantic city, most residents ignored his request. and when new york mayor michael bloomberg, three days before hurricane sandy landed, activated the city's storm plan and issued an evacuation order for the city's high-risk zone a floodplain, many observers thought he was over-preparing, like a grandmother urging you to wear galoshes in the rain. opinion: don't let superstorm sway your vote next time, evacuation orders will not be dismissed as examples of the ""nanny state."" hurricane sandy did not just erode beachfronts; it also eroded partisan political differences. how else can one explain gov. christie's warm and gracious comments about obama after the president did far more than what was required when he suggested that the new jersey republican personally call him if he needed any help with federal agencies. disasters never go away. they become part of our culture, providing stories of danger and heroism that we share with our children and their children. disasters take neighbors and make them friends. new yorkers, widely considered to be tough and selfish, are suddenly eager to share cellphones, drink beer with strangers at their local bars, and to cook meals at home -- since without subways there is no way to go out for dinner and get home easily. there is one simple lesson we can learn from hurricane sandy: we cannot ignore the essential infrastructure that moves people, information and goods. how you can help these systems are under the control of mayors and governors -- not presidents, senators or members of congress. more than two-thirds of the funds spent on transportation come from states and localities, not from the federal government. and with today's current emphasis on cutting the federal deficit, states will need to do more since the federal government is clearly in retreat, at home and overseas. it is not sufficient to have a smartphone or an ipad if we do not have resilient, robust networks that can function when we need them most, like in a disaster. it is not sufficient to have a home, if there is no power to run appliances and water to drink and cook with. and, what good is a job if you cannot get to work -- whether by car, train, bus or plane? new york has a subway system that is more than a century old. our nation's airports control our airspace with obsolete technologies, needlessly adding to delays and pollution. and our commuter railroads rely on railroad bridges that are well beyond their shelf life. disaster relief: obama, romney differ on federal role hurricane sandy is not over. the damage is still being assessed. the recovery is going to be slower than we anticipate. and the losses are beyond measurement. homes destroyed, beaches reconfigured, boardwalks that cannot be replaced, and memories that cannot be renewed. but we can recognize the vital need to invest in the future: to take steps now to minimize similar disasters. we cannot eliminate the power of ocean currents and wind and storms, but we can do more to invest in stronger, safer transportation systems that can diminish the disruptions caused by the next hurricane. sandy certainly won't be the last of the destructive storms we encounter. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of mitchell l. moss.",mitchell moss: disaster reminds us how much we rely on our local governments

"-- fifteen years ago this month, rwanda declared a cease-fire in a genocide that left more than 800,000 dead. in the attacks that started in april 1994, hutu militias and members of the general population sought out tutsis and moderate hutus -- and went on a 100-day killing rampage. in june of 1994, rwanda was still in the grip of a 100-day killing rampage. civilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their tutsi neighbors. it was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. some figures put the number of dead at 1 million, 10 percent of the population of the central african nation. millions more were raped and disfigured. a whole generation of children lost their parents. what started the tutsi and hutu rivalry the tutsi ethnic minority and the hutu majority had been at odds even before 1994. the rivalry started during colonial times, when the belgians considered tutsis the privileged ethnicity, thus giving them better opportunities. the hutus were considered inferior, prompting resentment that was passed on through the generations. the first major assault on tutsis occurred in 1959, killing thousands and prompting more attacks over the years. the animosity caused the tutsis to flee to neighboring countries, including burundi and uganda. the hutus took over the government when rwanda gained its independence from belgium in 1962, but the resentment remained. hours before the genocide in early april, a plane carrying then-president juvenal habyarimana, a hutu, was shot down near the capital, kigali. the president, his burundian counterpart and their aides were killed. a few hours later, rwanda erupted into chaos. some have accused current president paul kagame, a tutsi, of masterminding the killing. kagame, who led a tutsi militia group at the time, has denied any ties. he has accused hutu rebels of instigating the assassinations to incite fury and attacks on tutsis. differences between hutus and tutsis they speak the same language and practice the same customs. however, most tutsis are considered tall and lanky, which has led to speculation that they have ethiopian heritage. during the genocide, the bodies of tutsis were thrown into rivers by the hutus, who said they were sending them back to ethiopia. the aftermath of the genocide after 100 days of death and destruction, the tutsi militia led by kagame defeated the hutu rebels and took control of the government. scores of hutus fled to neighboring democratic republic of congo, where they have been accused of inciting more violence. rwanda has invaded congo various times to launch an offensive against hutus allegedly linked to the genocide. after the cease-fire, a multiethnic government made up of hutu president pasteur bizimungu and vice president kagame came into power. bizimungu was later accused of ethnic discord and jailed. kagame became president in 2000. trials for genocide suspects top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide are tried in the rwandan justice system and the international criminal tribunal, which is based in tanzania. civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried in gacaca courts. the latter are community courts conducted by a panel of nine civilians in an open field. the courts allow survivors to point out and confront their attackers. gacaca means ""open grass"" in the local language. human rights organizations say the gacacas fall short on delivering justice. state of the nation 15 years later rwanda is now considered one of africa's most stable nations. education, health care, tourism and trade -- which were destroyed in the genocide -- have improved dramatically. kagame has made big strides against corruption, a major problem in africa. however, critics have accused him of being an autocratic leader who has stifled the country's media. others have said the growth in economy is limited to urban areas and has not trickled into rural areas.",simmering hatreds between tutsi and hutu erupted in genocide in 1994
"-- the syrian government blamed last friday's rebel attack on an electric power station in downtown damascus on ""armed terrorist gangs"" -- the same epithet it has used to describe the protest movement that erupted in the southern border city of daraa more than a year ago. but the gunfire and explosions that echoed across the syrian capital in recent days have underscored a turning point of sorts. the clashes shattered the notion that damascus exists in a security bubble. helicopters said to fire indiscriminately syria experts say the battle for syria's two largest cities -- damascus and the country's economic capital, aleppo -- has begun. ""in both places we've seen not just more armed clashes than ever in the past, but also a revival of the protest movement in its peaceful dimension,"" said peter harling, a damascus-based analyst with the conflict-resolution organization international crisis group. ""what has changed is the conflict has moved into areas that the regime claimed was being dominated by the silent majority, which wanted stability, not regime change,"" harling added. that facade has been shattered in recent weeks, not by bullet or bombs, but through padlocks and keys. on monday, may 28, row after row of shops and stalls in the cavernous hamidiya bazaar in the heart of damascus were shuttered. shopkeepers across the capital staged a general strike to protest against the suspected massacre of civilians in the village of houla -- allegedly by pro-government militia. ""when the merchants of hamidiya -- the main souq (marketplace) -- go on strike, you know you have lost the conscience and heart of damascus,"" wrote joshua landis, a syria expert and director of the center for middle east studies at the university of oklahoma. ""the sunni bourgeoisie has now turned on the regime.."" ""this is really a very strong signal suggesting that the historical alliance between the regime and the business establishment in the capital is at least partially broken,"" added icg's harling. harling pointed out that even during the height of the bloody syrian government crackdown against the muslim brotherhood in 1982, hafez al assad, the father of the current syrian president, succeeded in preventing damascus merchants from staging strikes. several days after last month's market strike in damascus, however, shopkeepers in several aleppo commercial districts mounted a similar but smaller protest. ""i didn't open my shop. all the aleppo suburbs are on strike today (after) what happened in houla,"" an aleppo shopkeeper who asked only to be named abu karim, said in a phone interview with cnn. ""we carry the responsibility for continuing to work while people are dying,"" abu karim added. ""that is our shame."" in some cases, syrian security forces lashed out at the silent commercial protest. one activist video showed men in camouflage uniforms using bolt cutters to force open the metal shutters of locked shops on a damascus street. the violence roiling the country, combined with sanctions imposed by western governments, has contributed to economic hardship faced by ordinary syrians. more than a dozen residents of damascus and aleppo interviewed by cnn complained of daily power outages and rising prices of commodities including sugar and cooking fuel. ""they cut the electricity for two hours every morning, and of course it affects work a lot, because the whole company runs on computers,"" said the ceo of a damascus-based media company, speaking to cnn on condition of anonymity for fear of his life. he said he had assigned one of his employees the task of purchasing diesel to run backup generators, but added that this was complicated by the recent spike in the price of fuel. ""with the economic sanctions on the country, it is difficult for us to continue providing services because money transactions cannot get through to us from our [foreign] clients,"" the ceo said. ""due to power outages, all the perishable food stocks in my refrigerators and freezers were ruined,"" said usama, a damascus shopkeeper who asked only to be identified by his first name to protect himself from reprisal. usama told cnn he finally decided to shut down his business. ""what's the point of having a shop when nobody buys from you and people have no money to spend, and when they do they only spend it on the most basic needs?"" he asked. as economic conditions have worsened, the security presence in the two main cities has ramped up dramatically. a recent opposition video showed military trucks and hundreds of soldiers dressed in camouflage using the main sports stadium in damascus as an apparent staging ground. ""it's so different than when i was here six months ago,"" reported deborah amos, a correspondent for u.s. national public radio, in a broadcast from damascus on saturday. ""this was an alive city. people were out at night. they were in the cafes and in the restaurants. (now) at night, the people go home and it's time for the army to take over."" analysts argue that president bashar al-assad's regime's decision to use overwhelming military force to try to crush opposition in second-tier cities like homs has only spread the tentacles of the insurgency into cities that were once bastions of government support. al-assad defined by indecision, violence ""the regime has been sowing dragon's teeth,"" wrote joshua landis of the university of oklahoma. ""for every opponent of the regime killed, several more pop up to take its place."" ""what we see is a regime whose narrative boiled down to 'us or chaos.' but increasingly what we see is 'them and chaos,"" said harling of the international crisis group. ""the regime has been incapable of imposing law and order."" the syrian regime is still far from defeated. it has fervent supporters and vastly better weapons than the rebels. but the image it successfully projected throughout much of the first 15 months of the uprising -- that of a government in control -- has begun to crack.",gunfire echoing across damascus underscores a turning point of sorts
"french gastronomy is a male-dominated world, and its centuries-old traditions are fiercely protected. so, although anne-sophie pic is the daughter and granddaughter of michelin-starred chefs, it was not always clear she would continue the family tradition. but in 2007, with no formal training, pic became the only female chef in france (and only the fourth woman in history) to earn the culinary world's top honor -- a three-michelin-star rating -- for her family's restaurant, la maison pic, in the rhone-alpes town of valence. while in 2011, she was voted world's best female chef as part of the world's 50 best restaurants awards. pic believes her success comes because of, not in spite of, being a woman. she considers the lighthearted taste combinations she has pioneered to be an expression of her femininity: diners at her flagship restaurant can eat turbot flavored with jasmine, veal sweetbreads flavored with lavender and oysters with sorrel jelly and licorice yoghurt. the men in pic's life are also important to her success, though. having left her hometown as a teenager to study management, pic returned to valence, aged 23, to learn cooking from her father, shortly before he died. now 42, she has a six-year-old son and works with her husband to run la maison pic, which has expanded to include a boutique hotel, a cooking school and a casual bistro. in 2009, pic opened another michelin-starred restaurant in lausanne, and launched a gastronomic foundation for children. her first paris restaurant, la dame de pic, opens in september. here, pic speaks to cnn about the influence of family and femininity on her work. on the glass ceiling ... in the very beginning -- i'm talking about 20 years ago -- the profession was not open-minded enough to accept a woman in this job, and i felt that very strongly. that can awaken something very strong, though. little by little, i realized that being a woman could be a strength. it's another way of thinking about cuisine. it's another way of managing people, also. on femininity ... all my emotions are feminine, so i have this feminine way in my cooking. i think some men are able to make very feminine cuisine, but they are perhaps more focused on technique, less on developing the emotional part. my great grandmother taught my grandfather how to cook, so the family cuisine came from a woman. on travel ... i left to study business in paris because i didn't know what i wanted to do. i spent six months in japan and six months in the united states. it was good experience. i discovered japanese cuisine. i discovered champagne. i was far from my family and i had a chance to grow. from others, i discovered the beauty of my father's job. i needed to leave to understand that. on entering the family business ... i decided to return home in '92 to learn from my father. i spent three months with him. we talked a lot. it was a beautiful time. unfortunately, that september, he passed away. of course, it was a shock. how to manage without him? i was in the kitchen but it was difficult because i missed him a lot. i decided to work in reception, but when we lost a [michelin] star in '95, i decided to return to the kitchen. i felt i had lost my father's third star, and i had to get it again for him. on success ... the main change was that the phone kept ringing all the time. it was like a tsunami. and even though it's an honor, when you get the third star you now must give more effort, more energy to maintain standards and even improve the organization. on trust ... if you are fully booked all the time, you need to have more employees and to train them. i was quite afraid of development. because i'm a perfectionist, i couldn't trust a team not working with me everyday. but because i'm also a mother, i have to trust people. i'm not in the kitchen all day; i am sometimes with my son. it can be an adventure to trust people. on being a mother ... i was married, i became a mother, and it changed me a lot. it gave me more maturity in my cuisine, also. i used to say, it's more important for me to be a mother than to be a chef, because if i don't feel all is well with my child, i'm not able to work well. so, it influences my creativity. and it balances my character: i'm a perfectionist, but when i go home, i can forget all my troubles. on her typical day ... i wake at seven in the morning and get my child ready for school. i go to work at nine, beginning in the kitchen. if i have appointments with suppliers or if i'm experimenting, i do that very, very early in the morning because that's the time i feel better. then there is a lunch service, appointments, discussions about cooking with my assistant. three times a week, i try to pick my son up from school. then my husband comes home. we try to dine together, because it's the only part of the day all of the family is together. on mentoring women ... i'm very attentive to the women in the kitchen. i'm always acting like a mother, looking at their face to see if everything is all right, because i know that physically, they can tire before men. mentally, they are strong. on her husband's role ... i let him manage everything but the cuisine. the only thing is -- and he knows this -- it has to be feminine. when people come here, they have to feel something the moment they enter the house. his work is as important as mine, but he accepts not being in the spotlight and, for me, that's proof of intelligence. and love, of course. on advice for others ... the main thing is to develop your own talent. sometimes it takes a lot for people to understand what they are on earth for. you have to trust yourself. when i first started, i didn't know how to cook. i was a woman. i lost my teacher -- my father. but there's always a way to transform negative to positive. you have to believe in yourself. i don't believe in myself all the time, but something inside me tells me, 'it's your job. you have to express your sensibility.' the point is -- and nobody can do it except you -- to find what you are made for.",anne-sophie pic comes from a long line of michelin-starred chefs
"federal airport screeners still find four to five guns at checkpoints on a typical day, the transportation security administration's chief told a senate hearing wednesday. ""yesterday we found six, including one at ... bradley (airport in connecticut) -- a loaded gun with seven rounds in it, in a checked bag that (a passenger) was trying to get through,"" administrator john pistole said. passengers typically say they forgot the weapon was in their bag, tsa officials said. but in one recent case, a passenger at dallas-fort worth international airport tried to board a plane with two pistols, three ammunition magazines, eight knives and a hand saw in a carry-on bag, the tsa said. that passenger was arrested by local law enforcement. more than 900 guns have been recovered at checkpoints this year, the tsa says. at a wide-ranging senate homeland security committee hearing, pistole mentioned the connecticut gun find as evidence of the effectiveness of the agency. pistole also touted his program to expedite screening for trusted travelers, full-body scanners which can find nonmetallic items and ""behavior detection officers,"" some of whom now question passengers in an effort to ferret out terrorists. more than 150,000 people have gone through the ""expanded"" behavior detection at boston logan international airport, pistole said. ""we've had probably a dozen or so people who were referred to law enforcement because of their response,"" he said. ""and it turned out, some of these individuals had outstanding warrants for them. some were illegal immigrants."" pistole said the expanded behavior detection is being tested in boston and detroit, adding, ""i want to get the data from those two airports before i make any decisions whether to expand it or not."" he said he would report back to the committee on the results at the test airports. senators at the hearing generally praised the tsa for its work. but members of the travel industry, who testified after pistole, said that current passenger-screening procedures were stifling travel and need to be improved. ""since 2004, tsa's overall budget has increased by 68%. during the same time period, passenger levels have remained almost the same,"" said roger dow, president and ceo of the u.s. travel association. ""tsa is spending more money each year to screen the same amount of passengers."" dow cited a 2008 survey in which 28% of air travelers said they avoided at least one trip because of the hassles of air travel, which included aviation congestion and passenger screening. airline fees for checked luggage are prompting people to bring more carry-on bags, adding to checkpoint congestion, dow said. sen. mary landrieu, d-louisiana, said she would introduce legislation requiring airlines to include at least one bag in the price of a ticket, in an effort to reverse the trend and speed up inspections at checkpoints.","tsa administrator john pistole gives update on ""behavior detection"""

"-- deborah harkness found a productive way to cope with her mid-life crisis. the accomplished academic turned to fiction writing. ""some people buy expensive cars,"" the 49-year-old author says. ""i wrote a novel."" it wasn't just any novel, either. harkness' debut, ""a discovery of witches,"" launched the best-selling ""all souls"" trilogy, which has been described by at least one reviewer as ""harry potter but for grown-ups."" while historian harkness had already published several academic books and articles, fiction writing was a new endeavor. harkness found freedom in looking into her imagination, rather than her research, while writing about a star-crossed witch and vampire. when she doesn't know the answer to something she's writing about, she can get creative, but she stayed true to her roots in history when she wrote the trilogy. (one character, matthew clairmont, is 1,500 years old and his paramour, diana bishop is a historian, herself). ""the book of life,"" came out in july and weaves together supernatural creatures and good old-fashioned family drama. in this series finale, the now-married protagonists wrestle with real world demons, as well as mythical creatures. in addition to her literary career, harkness teaches history at the university of southern california in los angeles. she spoke with cnn about love, literature and why the humanities still matter in academia. below is an edited transcript. cnn: how have you managed the transition from academic writer to fiction writer? harkness: i never had a plan to be a fiction writer. it's something that happened to me. sometimes i think maybe it was my spectacular mid-life crisis. some people buy expensive cars, and i wrote a novel. i think even if you had said to me in 2007, ""i predict you will write a novel next year,"" i would have bet my house against it. there was no plan for it. i was so deeply involved in the world of scholarship, and indeed i still am. i reached a point where it was really a kind of interesting challenge to me, to think about how could i make the case to a wider audience that history and a knowledge of the past was meaningful and relevant. cnn: how has your experience of writing fiction informed your teaching? deborah harkness: i think it has made me a much better teacher of writing itself. after 20 years of writing academic prose and lectures, it seems very familiar and straightforward to me. writing a novel for the first time, i was reminded of just how difficult it is to figure out how to get this stuff done when you don't really know what you're doing. i think i have a lot more empathy for my own students, and for their learning process. and it's a two-way street, in that my teaching, and what i'm working on and what i'm talking about in the classroom, are constantly informing the fiction as i write it. cnn: family plays a big role in the trilogy. how have you been able to weave that in? harkness: so much fiction focuses on: ""will they or won't they? will our two heroes, or our hero and heroine, get together?"" that question has not ever really interested me. falling in love is really relatively easy, compared to staying in love and building a family that lasts. i always wanted to focus on that aspect of it, which i think is something that is so crucial and vital in so many ways, and so important, and so very tricky, because a lot of compromises and adjustments have to be made. people who get through ""the book of life"" and then are looking back over the whole trilogy, are going to say: ""she's been talking about this since the very beginning."" these have never been two lovers just off on a date, with nobody around them who mattered. it's always been about building a family and a community around themselves. cnn: how has the research process been different from your academic work? harkness: the research is not that much different, but the writing is. when i don't know the answers to something, and i'm writing a work of academic non-fiction, i have to look up the answers and be really, really precise. and of course, if i don't know the answer to something in fiction, i can make it up. there are still a lot of things i do look up if i want to get them right. but it is kind of a wonderfully creative thing thinking, ""oh -- what if shakespeare was actually not the center of attention, but kind of a hanger-on. that would be fun to play with."" you do get to imagine yourself into places where the historical research just can't take you because there are no records that survive. for a historian, who's normally not allowed to do that, that was also a lot of fun. cnn: what courses are you teaching? harkness: in the spring, i will be teaching a seminar on queens, witches and courtesans -- women and power in early modern europe. and the other course i'm teaching for the very first time is public history. for our undergraduate majors, (it's about) what do you do with your degree in history? how can you bring your historical skills to bear on a wider community? there is a lot of talk in the academy about the death of the humanities. based on my readers' response, and their interest in history and literature and art, the death of the humanities has been grossly overstated. i would love for my students to take a leading role in reminding people that this stuff is important and it really matters.","deborah harkness' ""all souls trilogy"" has sold more than a million copies"
"-- a fugitive gunman thought to be behind a string of armed robberies and murders in china dating back to 2004 has been shot and killed following a huge manhunt. zhou kehua -- one of the country's most wanted criminals -- was killed by police in the southwestern city of chongqing on tuesday morning, the state-run xinhua news agency reported. described as ""ruthless and highly dangerous"" by chinese authorities, zhou became infamous for robbing people while they were drawing money from banks and repeatedly dodging police manhunts. thousands of police and soldiers were drafted in over the weekend to search for the 42 year old after a woman was shot dead and two others injured on friday outside a bank in chongqing during an attempted robbery, xinhua said. later that day, local police reported that a railway policeman was killed while in pursuit of a man believed to be zhou -- his ninth victim in eight years following a series of robberies in chongqing, nanjing and changsha. all his victims were shot in the head, according to media reports. zhou was eventually tracked down in shapingba, a mountainous district on the outskirts of chongqing, after police uncovered a cave on monday that zhou is believed to have stayed in. inside were two cigarette cases, a t-shirt and human waste, china daily reported. china's ministry of public security classified zhou as a ""class-a"" suspect, with a total 5.4 million yuan (us$849,000) in rewards being offered for information leading to his capture. a huge -- but ultimately fruitless -- search for zhou was carried out in january this year after he allegedly shot and robbed a man who had just withdrawn 200,000 yuan ($31,700) from a bank in nanjing before fleeing in a car. nanjing public security bureau's xuanwu district office told cnn at the time that tens of thousands of police officers took part in the manhunt. it also published two video clips online of the suspect escaping the scene.",zhou kehua -- one of the country's most wanted criminals -- killed by police in chongqing

"(cnn)she was the first person to contract ebola in the united states, and now she's suing the hospital where she got infected. nina pham, a nurse at texas health presbyterian hospital dallas, filed a lawsuit monday against the hospital's parent company, texas health resources. she claims the company made her ""a symbol of corporate neglect -- a casualty of a hospital system's failure to prepare for a known and impending medical crisis."" thr ignored ebola warnings, its chief medical officer ""made numerous patently false statements to congress,"" and the company ""wholly failed to ensure that appropriate polices, procedures, and equipment were in place,"" leaving health care providers untrained, unprotected and at risk for exposure, the lawsuit says. ""i was hoping that thr would be more open and honest about everything that happened at the hospital, and the things they didn't do that led to me getting infected with ebola,"" pham said in a statement. ""but that didn't happen and i felt i was left with no choice but to turn to the courts for help."" the company's ceo, barclay berdan, sent a letter to employees monday night after news of the lawsuit broke. ""nina and so many others of you served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of ebola to arrive in a u.s. hospital's emergency room,"" the statement read. ""texas health resources values our strong culture of caring and compassion, and we view all employees as part of our family. that's why we have continued to support nina both during and after her illness, and it's why she is still a member of our team."" according to the suit, the hospital chain failed to provide proper training to handle ebola. pham contracted the disease last fall while treating thomas eric duncan, who started showing symptoms after arriving in dallas from liberia. ""in a cruel twist, after watching mr. duncan go through the horrific and painful course of the disease as she desperately tried to save his life, nina herself was diagnosed with ebola just two days after mr. duncan's life was taken by it,"" the lawsuit states. because the hospital initially discharged duncan when he arrived seeking treatment, it hurt his chances of beating the virus, the lawsuit says. ""had thr heeded the cdc and other warnings and ensured its hospitals were ready for ebola, mr. duncan would have had the best opportunity to possibly survive,"" it says. pham also claims that the hospital failed to provide her with the necessary protective equipment, despite cdc warnings. ""based on what she could learn from the internet, on the first day she cared for mr. duncan, nina put on a regular isolation gown covering her front and back, double gloves, a surgical mask with plastic shield and double booties. importantly, nina's neck and hair remained exposed. nina was not even (provided) disposable scrubs or a change of clothes. she had to wear the scrubs she wore that first day home, taking out of the hospital clothing that was potentially carrying the virus,"" the lawsuit says. when her mother learned she was treating duncan, she tried to persuade her to call in sick or even quit, but pham replied, ""mom, i can't abandon him. he is my patient. it's my job. i'm going back,"" according to the lawsuit. texas health resources spokesman wendell watson issued a statement in response to the lawsuit: ""nina pham served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of ebola to arrive in a u.s. hospital's emergency room. texas health resources has a strong culture of caring and compassion, and we view all our employees as part of our family. that's why we have continued to support nina both during and after her illness, and it's why she is still a member of our team. as distressing as the lawsuit is to us, we remain optimistic that we can resolve this matter with nina."" comparing the conditions facing nurses to what one would expect in a poorly developed country, the suit further states that after duncan died, pham was told she was at ""no risk"" for ebola ""and that she could freely see her friends and family."" two days later, she found out she had ebola. ""thr quickly learned that nina and her dog bentley had enormous public support and sympathy. so thr began trying to use nina as a pr tool to save its plummeting image. while nina laid in isolation, heavily medicated and facing a potentially gruesome death, thr had its pr department calling nina. the pr department was trying to release information and use nina as part of its thr-corporate-driven #presbyproud campaign,"" the lawsuit says. pham's lawsuit also says texas health resources violated her privacy by sharing her medical records. in his letter to employees, berdan said the company had pham's permission to release information. ""thr was sensitive to nina's privacy, and we adhered to hipaa (health insurance portability and accountability act) rules in determining what information to share publicly,"" the ceo said. ""we had nina's consent to share the information about her that was released."" another nurse treating duncan, amber vinson, also contracted ebola. both nurses recovered after being sent to hospitals specially equipped and staffed to handle ebola -- pham at the national institutes of health in maryland, and vinson at emory university hospital in atlanta. pham is still employed and is getting a paycheck from texas health resources, but has not returned to work, cnn affiliate ktvt said. she is still suffering fatigue and body aches, but her lawyer told the affiliate it's not clear whether the ailments are from ebola or from the experimental drugs pham received. she also experiences anxiety and frequent nightmares and suffers from the stigma of being the ebola nurse and she may not nurse again, the lawsuit says ""professionally, she doubts whether she can ever be a critical care nurse again -- in part because of the emotional stress and anxiety over the trauma she experienced and in part because of the fear and stigma that follows her. so despite only just beginning to pursue her dream of a career in critical care nursing, nina is now faced with the possibility of never returning to her passion,"" the lawsuit says. the lawsuit seeks damages for past and future physical pain, mental anguish, physical impairment, loss of enjoyment of life, medical expenses, loss of earning capacity and loss of reputation the lawsuit says. it does not set an amount for damages sought. ""the fact is, i'm facing a number of issues with regard to my health and my career and the lawsuit provides a way to address them,"" pham said in her statement. ""but more importantly, it will help uncover the truth of what happened, and educate all health care providers and administrators about ways to be better prepared for the next public health emergency. ""i particularly want to express my continued sympathy to the family of mr. duncan, as it was my privilege to care for him. i also want to acknowledge my fellow nurses, and the many friends, family and strangers for their ongoing concern and support."" cnn's karan olson, chandler friedman and vivian kuo contributed to this report.","nina pham gave consent to release medical information, hospital company ceo says"
"-- two more people in china have died from the h7n9 bird flu virus, raising the country's death toll to five, state-run news agency xinhua reported thursday, citing shanghai health officials. h7n9 is a strain of avian flu not detected in humans before china's recent cases, which the country began reporting on sunday. fourteen human cases of h7n9 -- all in eastern china -- have now been reported, according to xinhua. ""we don't know yet where the humans got their virus from,"" said dr. joseph bresee, who heads the epidemiology and prevention branch in the centers for disease control and prevention's influenza division. the virus has not been shown to spread easily between humans, he added. the two most recent deaths happened wednesday in shanghai hospitals. all but one of the five deaths have occurred in that city. one of wednesday's deaths was that of a 48-year-old poultry transporter who, although he died in shanghai, lived in nearby jiangsu province, xinhua reported. the three previously reported deaths were: two men -- ages 27 and 87 -- who lived in shanghai, and a 38-year-old man who lived in zhejiang province but worked in jiangsu province, according to state-run news agency xinhua. the cdc is working closely with chinese authorities trying to find the source of the human infections, bresee said. ""there are lots of things happening at cdc to prepare for this virus,"" bresee said. ""state health departments are readying themselves just in case,"" and researchers are working on developing a vaccine for this strain, he said. cnn's miriam falco contributed to this report.",new: cdc official says agency working with chinese to find source
"-- for several months in 2003, i did the whole european backpacker thing. which is to say i've seen nearly every cathedral within 1,000 square miles of the danube. ""are we cultured yet?"" ""shut up. two more."" it also means that i have an old journal filled out in the back with countless e-mail addresses from travelers i'll probably never see again. this was before the heyday of social media, back when pretending to care about people you just met required considerably less effort. because now when you go abroad, you actually have to connect with your fellow travelers over facebook. and then deny their candy crush requests. well, these casual travel friendships are about to go completely bonkers over the next two weekends as the world-famous tomorrowland festival kicks off in belgium. i'll get to why in a moment, but for those of you who are unfamiliar with tomorrowland, it's a multiday gathering of thousands upon thousands of beautiful young people from all over the planet, congregating in a fairytale-themed field, dancing all night to djs playing edm. (note to dad: edm stands for electronic dance music. it sounds nothing like willie nelson. just put on the golf channel and stay away from belgium.) that said, if you're not my dad and actually enjoy edm, it's probably a great time. especially if you're into that whole being young and enjoying life thing. i'd go, but my ical has me scheduled to wallow in self-doubt. (the following weekend is also completely booked with some pre-planned lower back pain.) however, if you do make it over to belgium, this year you'll be wearing a special festival bracelet that allows you to instantly send friend requests to people you just met. ""you get a friend request. you get a friend request. you get a friend request. everybody gets a friend request!"" now, because this festival is so delightfully wackadoo, these bracelets literally arrive at your door in a tomorrowland treasure case, which, from what i've seen online, is far more ornate than anything i currently have in my house. no offense, ikea. you see, this festival tends to go all-in on the ridiculous. and i like that. they've made it fun before you even get there. an instructional web video from tomorrowland explains that, once your treasure case arrives in the mail, you have to use a ""magical key"" to ""unlock the happiness."" then, inside the box, you'll find your bracelet, for which you have to go online to activate with a personalized code. next, to ""fully unleash all its magical power,"" you connect it to your facebook account. and if everything syncs up as it should, the bracelet is then armed for making instant friends. back in my day, we used cheap bourbon and old war stories. somehow, i just turned 72. but at tomorrowland, you and your new pal just need to be near each other while you press your ""heart"" buttons at the same time. the next day, you'll receive a daily ""special friendship"" e-mail with all the contact details of your new late-night besties. ""who the hell is gunther?"" ""he's that crazy german guy with no pants. you spent six hours with him building a glow stick castle."" ""oh, guuuuunther."" so, who knows what kind of new digital friends you'll suddenly make. the possibilities are endless. you can even play port-a-potty roulette with the person using the stall next to yours. ""i don't know who you are over there, or what you just ate, but ... one. two. three. go!"" what's also cool is that the bracelet is actually your entrance pass to the festival. there's no paper. and that's sort of the new trend in ticketing: high-tech smart bracelets. in fact, this year, lollapalooza in chicago is going cashless by using radio frequency identification-enabled wristband tickets that also allow festival-goers to make payments. the bracelets are linked to the user's credit card. which, after far too many beers, probably sounds like this: ""i'll take a poster. and a t-shirt. and a coozie. and another poster. and another t-shirt for that guy. and whatever this chick wants. and let's do another poster."" what could possibly go wrong? anyway, things have certainly changed since i promised to keep in touch with all those people i met back in europe. but this is just life as we know it in our crazy modern world. embrace it.

"-- apple is known for building excitement over its latest gadgets, but the company's next closely watched event has nothing to do with a product. instead, anticipation is growing over the scheduled return of apple's charismatic ceo. steve jobs looks gaunt at an event in october. he began a leave of absence three months later. it's been almost six months since steve jobs -- who co-founded apple and has thrilled the public by launching consumer tech favorites such as the iphone and the ipod -- announced that he was taking a medical leave of absence until the end of june. as that time quickly approaches, apple fans, investors and observers have been gripped by questions. will he come back as promised? if so, in what capacity? and how crucial is he still to the company's success? jobs, who is a pancreatic cancer survivor, revealed at the beginning of this year that a hormone imbalance caused the considerable weight loss that had some speculating whether his cancer had returned. see a timeline of jobs' life and career » ""the remedy for this nutritional problem is relatively simple and straightforward, and i've already begun treatment,"" jobs wrote in a letter addressed to the ""apple community"" on january 5. ""but, just like i didn't lose this much weight and body mass in a week or a month, my doctors expect it will take me until late this spring to regain it."" there had been little news since. but that all changed saturday when the wall street journal reported jobs, 54, had a liver transplant about two months ago in tennessee. he has been recovering well, but may work part time for several weeks when he returns to work, the newspaper reported. fortune: inside steve jobs' liver transplant the fact that the article appeared just hours after apple began selling its new iphone 3gs had some bloggers questioning the timing of the report, with some suggesting that the excitement over the rollout helped draw attention away from the revelations about jobs' health. apple didn't comment on the wall street journal report directly, answering media questions with the same statement. ""steve continues to look forward to returning to apple at the end of june, and there is nothing further to say,"" said apple spokesman steve dowling. dowling declined to provide a specific date for jobs' return or say whether jobs would be making any public appearances or statements. 'iconic figure' ""this feels like they're clearing the way for his return. but it wouldn't be out of character for apple to let the deadline slip a bit,"" said philip elmer-dewitt, who writes the apple 2.0 blog for fortune magazine and has been covering the company since 1982. ""the real issue of steve coming back is: how much does the company need him?"" how much, indeed? investors have been painfully aware of how any development regarding jobs' health -- real or rumor -- can affect apple's stock price. but experts say apple has been taking steps to ensure that its fortunes are not linked with jobs taking an active role in the company. watch how jobs' health has affected apple ""he's an iconic figure that everybody wants around, he's the world's greatest salesman and that's irreplaceable,"" said gene munster, a senior research analyst at piper jaffray who has been covering apple since 2003. ""but as far as the product direction and the product quality, the road map for the next five years is already in place [at apple]."" munster described jobs as a visionary and someone with the ability to figure out what the next big thing is. but he said piper jaffray's ""buy"" recommendation on the company's stock wouldn't change even if jobs doesn't come back, based on the strength of products such as the iphone. still, few companies have been so closely associated with their ceos. munster likened the situation to henry ford and the car company he founded at the beginning of the 20th century. elmer-dewitt said it could be compared to walt disney and the entertainment giant he created. jobs is also much more than just a ceo. his knack for developing must-have gadgets, his signature black turtlenecks and dramatic delivery during product launches have made him a cultural icon beyond silicon valley. he was even hilariously impersonated on ""saturday night live."" smaller role observers say apple and jobs himself have made efforts in recent years to ""wean"" the public off his presence, such as including other people onstage with him during events and de-emphasizing his role. ""last year a lot of pundits were [saying that] if steve jobs left the company, the company would just immediately fall into ruin,"" said daniel eran dilger, a contributing editor for appleinsider.com. ""and what's interesting is after he went on leave, and he's been gone for six months now, the company has had a couple of major announcements and events and has gone on fine."" when he began his leave of absence, jobs put apple chief operating officer tim cook in charge of the company's day-to-day operations. if jobs decides to step down, cook can take over and probably will, elmer-dewitt said. ""there are lots of smart people at apple and most people have sort of accepted the idea that ... jobs trained an executive team to operate the company without him,"" he added. ""and that his dna, the thing that makes apple different from all the other companies, has been baked into the leadership team and that the company will do fine."" what may be lacking years down the road if jobs retires or leaves is his ""x-factor"" and his unique stamp on every little piece of design. ""once you get a bunch of people in a room, none of whom is more powerful than the other, you start to get products that are literally designed by committee and that's what apple products never were,"" elmer-dewitt said.

"across the u.s., many families know firsthand how high maternity care costs are. as noted in the times recently, giving birth in the u.s. is more expensive than any other country in the world. total costs average $18,329 for a vaginal delivery and $27,866 for a c-section, with the bulk of the bill going to insurers. however, families with insurance still have to pay about $3400 out of pocket. what's ironic is we can't even claim that the extra expense pays off in healthier mothers and babies. according to a study by the institute of medicine, the u.s. ranks at or near the bottom on virtually all maternity care outcomes. so who's to blame for these high costs? partly, mothers themselves. americans are obsessed with the notions that ""newer is better"" and ""more technology is always a plus."" when it comes to medical technology, the u.s. public becomes oliver twist, continually asking, ""please, sir, i want some more."" i was part of a team that recently conducted a pair of national surveys of mothers. among the many questions, we asked if mothers agreed with the statement, ""newer maternity tests and treatments are generally improvements over older ones."" an overwhelming majority of mothers (74%) agreed while only 10% disagreed. likewise, when given the statement, ""maternity tests and treatments that work the best usually cost more than those that don't work as well,"" mothers were twice as likely to agree than disagree. mothers were also far more likely to agree that women get too few tests during pregnancy rather than too many. ""newer equals improvement"" and ""more is better than less"" have long been effective marketing themes in american culture. but the problem is that in the case of medical technology, the results don't consistently bear that out. while other countries have set up elaborate systems to assess new medical interventions for their cost effectiveness compared to existing practices before approving them, until recently that has not been a priority in u.s. medical care. the result is that public infatuation with newer technologies merges smoothly with the medical industry's desire to profit from providing more services. a prime example of this problem is the failure to take advantage of midwife-led birthing centers. these have been found in the u.s. and overseas to be a safe and cost effective alternative to universal reliance on large hospitals. freestanding birthing centers (as opposed to hospitals which refer to their maternity ward as a ""birthing center"") are usually directed by midwives and are affiliated with hospitals that serve as a referral site for transfers. the cost savings stem from less reliance on expensive medications and technologies, a shorter stay (mothers typically return home within 24 hours) and lower personnel costs. while the numbers of birthing centers have increased in the last decade, less than 1 in 300 u.s. births occur in a center. how come? consider who loses money if birthing centers become popular: large hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, obstetricians and anesthesiologists -- all powerful groups who believe deeply that the use of their products and services is not only a source of income, but the safest option for mothers and babies. the result is that an array of regulatory (restrictive state licensing laws) and financial barriers (denial of insurance coverage) combined with informal constraints (hospital refusal to provide backup) limit their use. freestanding birthing centers aren't for everyone. they are meant to serve women with lower risk pregnancies and there's about a 1 in 8 chance a woman would need to be transferred to a hospital during labor. nonetheless, it is of concern that so many women who are interested in it are denied an option that can provide a safe and far less expensive experience for mothers and babies. medical technology has done wonders for our lives, especially in select, high-risk cases. but rising maternity care costs reflects the downside of our societal obsession with newer, bigger and shinier technology. the u.s. needs to seriously rethink how we approach maternity care. the first question that needs to be addressed is: do more tests and reliance on the biggest, most expensive hospital settings actually improve the health of mothers and babies? when they do, great. but when they don't, we need to overcome the financial, institutional and cultural barriers to use reasonable options like birthing centers.",eugene declercq: u.s. maternity care costs are the highest in the world
"-- a u.s. soldier who blew the whistle on his fellow soldiers' links to the killing of civilians in afghanistan -- and who himself is accused of one slaying --has been moved to solitary confinement for his safety, a source said. spc. adam winfield, 21, told army investigators that he alerted his father to the civilian killings early this year and told him that he feared for his own life, according to an interrogation tape obtained by cnn. his father tried and failed to get the military to intervene, winfield's attorney, eric montalvo, said. winfield now is held in a military facility at joint base lewis-mcchord in washington along with other soldiers he said instigated the killings. some of those soldiers are facing charges in connection with three slayings of civilians, and winfield would be a key part of any case against them. winfield contacted his father about the serial killing ring inside his stryker brigade squad, and his father, christopher winfield, telephoned the army but with little result, montalvo said. the father's phone calls, from the family's home in cape coral, florida, and the failure of the army to take swift action to intervene are the focus of a separate military investigation, an army spokesman said. a person familiar with the case against winfield and the other soldiers said sunday that winfield had been moved to solitary confinement amidst concerns about his safety. but that person insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. authorities at lewis-mcchord, winfield's home base, would not comment on any questions about winfield. but a spokeswoman said that an investigation is underway, although she would not identify who was involved. ""we will not comment on measures taken to ensure this individual's safety,"" maj. kathleen turner, a public affairs officer for lewis-mcchord, said. ""the u.s. army cid is investigating allegations that a threat was made to one of the defendants; however, we are not releasing any further information associated with these allegations."" the army would provide no details of how winfield and the other defendants are being housed or whether they have been allowed to communicate amongst themselves. winfield, cpl. jeremy morlock of wasilla, alaska; pfc. andrew holmes of boise, idaho; spc. michael wagnon, of las vegas, nevada; and platoon leader staff sgt. calvin gibbs of billings, montana, are charged with premeditated murder charges in the killings of three afghan civilians between january and may of this year. seven other soldiers face charges ranging from conspiracy and interfering in a military investigation to drug use, specifically smoking hashish, while in afghanistan. military reports say that gibbs kept track of the killed with skull tattoos and collected body parts as souvenirs.","safety concerns prompt winfield's move, source says"

"robin lim, an american woman who has helped thousands of poor indonesian women have a healthy pregnancy and birth, was named the 2011 cnn hero of the year on sunday night. through her bumi sehat health clinics, ""mother robin,"" or ""ibu robin"" as she is called by the locals, offers free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid in indonesia, where many families cannot afford care. ""every baby's first breath on earth could be one of peace and love. every mother should be healthy and strong. every birth could be safe and loving. but our world is not there yet,"" lim said during ""cnn heroes: an all-star tribute,"" which took place at the shrine auditorium in los angeles and recognized lim and the other top 10 cnn heroes of 2011. many women in the developing world do not have access to contraception or maternal care. according to the united nations population fund, three out of five women giving birth in south asia do so without a skilled birth attendant on hand. in indonesia, the average family earns the equivalent of $8 a day, according to the international monetary fund. but a baby delivery costs about $70 at a hospital, and a caesarian section can cost as much as $700. lim believes indonesia's high maternal and infant mortality rates are caused in part by these costs, which many women cannot meet. ""the situation is bad ... babies are unattended, deliveries have become commercialized, and mothers die from hemorrhage after childbirth because they can't afford proper care,"" lim told cnn earlier this year. the cnn hero of the year was chosen by the public after an 11-week vote on cnn.com. for being named hero of the year, lim will receive $250,000 for her cause. that's in addition to the $50,000 that she and the rest of the top 10 heroes each received for making the top 10. this is the fifth year that cnn, with the help of entertainers and other celebrities, have honored everyday people changing the world. among this year's presenters were comedians jerry seinfeld and george lopez; actors j.r. martinez and chris colfer; musical artists ice cube and will.i.am; model christy turlington burns; former nfl quarterback kurt warner; and actresses laura dern, mary-louise parker and sofia vergara.

"-- it's official: ted cruz is democratic enemy number one. in the span of a year, cruz has transformed himself from a little-known senate candidate into the face of a government shutdown that has roiled washington politics and raised questions about the viability of the american political process. democrats are now raising his profile at every turn, in political campaigns from brooklyn to san diego, casting him as a right wing zealot and hoping to hang the controversial tea party icon around the necks of every republican office-seeker in the country. cruz: use debt ceiling debate for leverage the first-term texas senator, a shrewd and often shameless promoter of stand-your-ground conservatism, is currently starring in a slew of television ads, talking points and a raft of fundraising emails attacking republicans over the ongoing government shutdown. far from being an object of fear, cruz is a welcome newcomer for democrats -- the embodiment of what they claim is dangerous tea party obstructionism, and a far more useful villain than mitch mcconnell, john boehner or any of the buttoned-up regulars straight out of capitol hill central casting. dnc targeting key republicans over shutdown cruz might be responsible for pushing the united states government to the apogee of dysfunction, but for democratic operatives charged with winning elections, any cruz is good news. ""it's not that we're making cruz a bogeyman,"" said mo elleithee, the communications director for the democratic national committee. ""it's that republicans are making him their leader. we're more than happy to have a debate with them over whether that's a good thing for the country or not."" with helpful prodding from top democrats in the nation's capital, the ""debate"" over cruz is playing out in races around the country, far from the halls of the congress. when carl demaio, a republican house candidate in southern california, made a sympathetic remark about cruz during a speech to the downtown san diego lions club last week, operatives from the democratic congressional campaign committee in washington quickly packaged the clip and circulated it to local reporters under the slug: ""carl demaio's model legislator: ted cruz."" in the new york mayor's race, long shot republican nominee joe lhota said in a radio interview that he favored delaying the affordable care act's individual insurance mandate by a year. the campaign of democrat bill de blasio immediately turned their cannons on lhota, accusing him of ""marching in lockstep with republican extremists like ted cruz."" gingrich: the startling cnn poll across the hudson river in new jersey, democratic senate candidate cory booker name-dropped cruz during an attack on his gop opponent tuesday. 'the ted cruz strategy' and over the past two weeks, strategists working for the democratic senatorial campaign committee have been carpet-bombing local reporters in arkansas, colorado, georgia, iowa, kentucky, michigan, montana, north carolina and west virginia with statements accusing gop senate candidates in those states of supporting ""the ted cruz strategy"" of political brinksmanship. the texan also appears in a pair of new television ads about the shutdown from moveon.org and organizing for action, the white house's political operation. washington's warm bath of celebrity and self-interest then there's american bridge, the well-funded democratic research group that launched a cheeky website, ""speakercruz.com,"" after reports surfaced that the texas senator was brazenly advising gop house members from across the capitol before the shutdown began. the website depicts cruz telling an anguished boehner, ""i got it from here, bud."" ""ted cruz is a powerful tool for democrats for the same reasons he's so popular among the republican base: he's perfectly emblematic of where today's republican party is and where it's headed,"" said chris harris, a spokesman for american bridge. ""the tea party loves him for leading the republican party into this shutdown, but the vast majority of americans see it as the disaster it truly is."" nowhere has this theory been put to the test more than in the virginia governor's race, where cruz chewed up more than a week's worth of campaign oxygen in the closely watched contest between republican ken cuccinelli and democrat terry mcauliffe. cruz promises republican victory in shutdown fight after the government lurched toward shutdown last week, democrats were handed a well-timed gift: cruz had been previously booked to deliver the keynote address at a conservative gala in richmond where, as it happened, cuccinelli was also scheduled to speak. mcauliffe's campaign cut a television and radio ad binding the two republicans together, just as the 170,000 virginians who take home a federal paycheck were bracing for furloughs and service cutbacks. ""look who's coming to virginia this weekend,"" a stern-sounding narrator intoned on the radio ad, which was still on the air as of this week. ""ted cruz, the republican senator from texas who is the leader of the government shutdown. cruz is coming in to campaign for another radical republican, ken cuccinelli."" the democratic party of virginia launched a similar broadside, blitzing households with robocalls admonishing cuccinelli. american bridge got in on the act, too, creating a ""dump cruz"" petition demanding that cuccinelli not appear with the texan. zelizer: d.c. crisis could jump-start case for reform an uncomfortable position forget that cuccinelli, himself a tea party darling, was technically not holding a campaign event with cruz. the onslaught put cuccinelli in a vise grip, drowning out his message and putting him in the awkward position of demanding an end to the government stalemate while dodging questions about cruz's role in the beltway drama. when cuccinelli finally did speak at the family foundation dinner on saturday night, he made only a passing reference to the shutdown and made no mention of cruz, one of the gop's biggest stars who happened to be waiting backstage only a few yards away. he slipped out the richmond convention center in a hurry, well before cruz took the stage. aside from surveys that show the shutdown to be deeply unpopular, the blame-it-on-cruz strategy is, at the moment, more of a safe bet than a poll-tested message. polls show a vast majority of americans disapprove of the shutdown, and a cnn/orc poll on monday showed republicans in congress shouldering slightly more of the blame for the stalemate than democrats or president obama. yet while americans seem to have clear opinions on the shutdown, cruz is a much less defined figure. in a poll from quinnipiac university released last week, almost 60% of americans said they did not know enough about cruz to have an opinion about him. among those who did, opinions were slightly more negative than positive. democrats working on the virginia governor's race tested cruz's name in a focus group with roughly 30 undecided voters race this past weekend, according to a person familiar with the session, which was held in the washington suburbs where the shutdown's impact is felt most acutely. according to the source, cruz was not a well-known personality among the voters. but when the democratic operatives described cruz as a tea party leader with a prominent role in the shutdown, and said he was appearing with cuccinelli at the gala saturday night, impressions of both men soured among the focus group participants. some republican pragmatists, already worried that emboldened conservative hard-liners are tarnishing the party's brand, acknowledge that democrats appear to have found a potent weapon in cruz. david kochel, a 26-year veteran of iowa politics who managed mitt romney's presidential campaign in the battleground state, said bluntly that ""swing voters are repelled by cruz."" opinion: will glitches derail obamacare? little personal downside for cruz but there is little personal downside in the high stakes fight for cruz, an in-demand figure on the conservative speaking circuit who has designs on the 2016 republican presidential nomination. having a democratic bulls eye on his back only boosts his stature on the right, kochel argued. ""it's an interesting strategy that works to the benefit of democrats who want to attach his brand to the gop at a time when he's underwater in approval ratings, but it also works to cruz's benefit because it elevates him with the gop base,"" he said. rick wilson, a florida-based republican strategist, said cruz is custom-built for today's political environment, in which political leaders are often rewarded for combat and punished for compromise. ""the base loves him, he's become the official enemy of the left, and he's raising major bank,"" wilson said. ""this is the united states of ambition, and he's making his bones, fast."" cruz's white-hot profile could easily fade in the coming months, well before the 2014 midterm cycle begins in earnest. but the republican has shown a remarkably canny ability to maneuver his way into the national conversation. as long as cruz remains in the spotlight, democrats have plans to use him to their advantage. ""right now, ted cruz and the tea party has become a synonym for the problem, and we're going to continue to use that against the republicans who voted with him,"" said one national democratic strategist working on a number of house races. ""how big that will be next year, the verdict is still out on that."" is shutdown a sorry spectacle or shock treatment?","democrats cast cruz as right wing zealot, hope to hang him around every republican office-seeker"

"-- remember when social media websites were just about sharing fun things? i'm talking about the time when facebook was essentially a place to post photos of you having a great time and the most serious event shared was when a person changed his or her status from ""in a relationship"" to ""single."" but those days are gone. social media has now become a place to share deeply personal and often horribly painful events in our lives. it has, in essence, become an online group therapy session where people reveal the details of dreadful events from their lives in the hopes it helps them cope and will attract support from others. we saw it on display this week with 16-year-old hannah anderson, who was taken hostage by james dimaggio for a week after he allegedly killed hannah's mother and younger brother. within days of being freed, hannah went online to the website ask.fm and answered questions from the public about her ordeal. and she didn't just respond to a few questions, she fielded a long list of probing questions from ""why didn't you run?"" to ""are you glad (dimaggio is) dead?"" i noticed this evolution in the way people had begun to use social media last year, and at the time, i didn't like it. my concern was: why would anyone share the intimate details of tragic events from their lives with people online, many of whom are strangers? it really hit home this year when a friend posted on facebook that he had been diagnosed with cancer. i was shocked, first by the news but second by the fact he announced his diagnosis on facebook. typically, this would be the type of news you would share only with family and close friends, and probably in a face-to-face conversation. but reading the comments responding to his original posting -- and the comments to his subsequent posts about his treatment -- caused me to change my view on what was appropriate to share on social media. the amount of support he received on his facebook page was astounding. he was touched by it, noting that the outpouring brought him comfort and inspired him to fight the disease even harder. many others are sharing the most heartwrenching events in their lives. in just the past few weeks, friends on facebook or twitter have posted information about the deaths of a parent or a grandparent. and this week, i saw an even more candid sharing of information when a friend posted on facebook that his brother in egypt had been shot by the police there during the recent protests. he followed that up a few hours later with updates about surgery to save his brother's life. finally, he posted a photo of his deceased brother from the morgue where they identified his body. a few weeks ago, npr host scott simon tweeted live updates from his dying mother's hospital room to his more than 1 million twitter followers. some said simon was invading his mother's privacy while others labeled him as self-centered, focused more on himself than his dying mother. but like many others, i found it to be a moving tribute to his mother. what sparked this trend to divulge information that had once been revealed only to family and close friends? there are a few reasons. first, it's clearly therapeutic for many. by sharing their painful experiences, it helps the person heal, and the show of support by others bolsters them. second, those who have been using social media for years on a daily basis have grown accustomed to sharing events and experiences from everyday life. we are now extending the scope of what we will share from our lives. finally, i believe there's a connection between a willingness to share private aspects of our lives and the reality tv show world in which we have been immersed for over a decade. on a nightly basis, we see people share their triumphs and tragedies, be it on shows like ""big brother"" or ""the real world"" or more contrived ones like ""honey boo boo"" or ""keeping up with the kardashians."" they have made it easier and more acceptable for us to do the same. to me, the best thing about this new trend is that you get to control it. it's your choice whether to disclose deeply personal information. those who find it unnerving or inappropriate can keep that information secret. but for the rest, social media may end up being a less expensive but helpful form of therapy. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dean obeidallah.",dean obeidallah: social media evolved from sharing trivial matters to more personal ones
"-- will young american voters be as enthusiastic about president obama's re-election as they were about his candidacy four years ago, when 66% of 18- to 29-year-olds favored him over john mccain? polls vary widely. but a public religion research institute survey gives obama only a 7-point lead over presumptive gop nominee mitt romney among millennials, while a new harvard poll says he has a 17-point lead -- still a worrisome number for democrats. if 2008 was any indication, an unshakeable youth coalition may be a prerequisite for democratic victory. the president seems to be listening: he has focused this week on young people, with stops at the university of north carolina at chapel hill, the university of colorado at boulder and the university of iowa in iowa city. but amid this climate of economic gloom, even apocalypse, for millennials, obama is rocking the campus vote ... with the single issue of loans? this is certainly a salient policy most directly affecting college students and recent graduates today. they will see reduced loan rates expire without prompt legislative action. and these students undoubtedly will warm, in the short term, to obama's efforts to sustain the current rates. however, three and a half years after young voters supported obama as a fixer-in-chief, the economic situation for millennials is in worse shambles, with debt and unemployment climbing for most 18- to 29-year-olds. more than half of recent graduates are unemployed or underemployed, according to a forthcoming study by northeastern university, says sheila palma of the school's center for labor market studies. gen y, people roughly between the ages of 18 and 34, may be the first generation since the new deal without lasting financial protection. this week, trustees of both social security and medicare reported that the solvency of both programs is slipping, and lawmakers need to take action quickly. a recent cnbc story said that gen y has no safety net for retirement beyond market-driven 401(k)s. on top of that risk, the financial hurdles of student loans, a weak housing market, and high unemployment are shaping this generation's deficient savings rate. this is a chilling glimpse into the extinction of the american middle-class for most young citizens. president obama's narrowly tailored discussion of the loan issue for millennials is not likely to rekindle the ""yes, we can"" enthusiasm of 2008 or spur effective policy for young people beyond the college years. channeling a message of social justice on the loan issue can go only so far. there is the wider issue of affordability -- policy that could make college cost-free for middle-income students -- and the fundamental need to improve millennial social mobility. to galvanize the youth vote anew in 2012, when young people's economic livelihood is at stake, obama will have to reach deeper than loans. how about a plan for young americans after college: stronger jobs legislation geared around recent grads? a proposal to reclaim social security? the president knows how pivotal the youth vote is for his re-election odds. but his bid for a second term will hinge upon across-the-board substantive answers for young people, so their economic situation is not such a raw one. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of alexander heffner.",alexander heffner: obama on college tour addressed student loans to recapture youth vote
"-- the michael brown case has great significance because it is yet another in a growing line of tragedies that further demand a conversation about our civil liberties within the criminal justice system. it has highlighted a massive lack of trust that exists between police and minorities. we must face the inconsistencies and the biases that remain if we are ever to move towards a system worthy of the trust it needs to succeed. only by doing so can we end the devastating loss of life that is becoming an all-too-common occurrence. we have another opportunity to become focused on and vocal about the changes that are necessary. it is only by bringing those problems to the forefront and into the harsh light of constant and public critique that we can hope to make a better system. i still contend our criminal justice system is the best in the world for dispensing true justice, but, like every facet of the american democratic experience, it can use polishing. however, i reject the notion that the system is incapable of dispensing justice in cases where young, unarmed black men and women are killed. with my experience representing george zimmerman as a backdrop, i've been following a number of cases that have overtones of ferguson, and i know that we have made progress: earlier this month, michael dunn received a life sentence for the murder of jordan davis in the so-called ""loud music"" trial. in january, a grand jury indicted officer randall kerrick on voluntary manslaughter charges after fatally shooting unarmed jonathan ferrell. and on august 7, a jury in michigan convicted ted wafer of second-degree murder for shooting renisha mcbride on his front porch. the verdict came just two days before the michael brown shooting. black victims, white shooters. certain commentators have suggested we should skip the grand jury and that officer darren wilson must be tried before a jury. while i laud the idea of having open trials, thereby allowing the public to view that the process works fairly, it is dangerous to short-circuit justice because of media attention or social pressure. we gave the ferguson shooting an enhanced social significance before we knew all the facts of the case, facts we still don't know. the grand jury should not consider the broader social issues; they should focus on the facts. and if they decide, solely on the facts, to indict wilson, only then should he stand trial. but in light of the recent press leaks regarding evidence in the case, most now suggest an indictment is not likely. i fear that those who equate justice with nothing other than an indictment of wilson are allowing deep-seated predispositions against the system to infect how they define justice. we should not be asking for reparations at the cost of putting a thumb on the scales of justice in favor of convicting, or even charging, someone who does not, based upon the facts as viewed dispassionately, deserve it. i do not suggest trust in this system merely to quell the voices of criticism or to forestall the feelings of frustration. rather i contend it is the only answer. so, what happens if the grand jury decides not to indict darren wilson? district attorney mccullough committed that he will release all of the transcripts of the proceedings. this will give all the witness testimony, forensic evidence, and other information presented from which they decided not to indict. transparency here is absolutely necessary. the federal officials should not interfere with that release. if wilson is not charged, there will, undoubtedly, be a backlash. many people consider an indictment as a step for justice -- not only in this individual case -- but in the larger effort of balancing the racial inequities in our justice system. conversely, a failure to indict wilson will be seen as an indictment of the system. but that point of view is not only wrong, it is dangerous. i fear that pinning significant civil rights issues to the facts of this case may serve only to foster more mistrust in the system. it will create a greater racial divide, and it will create another generation of disenfranchised young black men and women who are less willing to become police officers or legislators or attorneys or judges at the very time that we need their leadership most. if the grand jury decides not to indict, they will do so because they concluded officer darren wilson's shooting to be justified based upon his and michael brown's actions. while it is considered callous and insensitive to review the actions of a deceased person, it does none of us any good to ignore facts, should they exist. by doing so, we lose the lessons that may be learned from a dispassionate analysis of what actually happened that day, not what we as individuals, or we as communities, want to believe happened. the decision to indict or not can be a catalyst for us to move further apart, or it can be seen as an opportunity to critically analyze how these tragedies are occurring and how to stop them in the future. that choice, no matter how it may go against the grain of our emotions, is a voluntary one, but we must decide on the latter.",grand jury hearing michael brown case; some believe there won't be indictment
"-- the syfy channel is known for a certain kind of escapist fun. saturday nights are reserved for their original movies: movies that are lower-budget than the fare seen in theaters, but still meet science fiction fans' need for fantastic monsters, time travel and magic. with a reputation for being delightfully campy, syfy's original movies are a guilty pleasure, said colin ferguson, star of syfy's original series, ""eureka."" ""within the bandwith of the campy sci-fi movie, you can go from completely self-aware, with something like [classic sci-fi movie] 'attack of the killer tomatoes,' and then in the middle you have something like [the syfy movie] 'sharktopus,' where the creature is just way over the top, sort of on purpose,"" ferguson said. ""and on the other end you have sort of the more realistic version of the campy creature, like 'triassic attack,'"" he added. ""triassic attack,"" is ferguson's syfy original movie directorial debut and will air saturday, november 27, at 9 p.m. et. the movie is about the fossilized remains of dinosaurs that are brought back to life by a native american spell and urged to wreak havoc on a small town. the ravenous, animated skeletons start eating as many people as they can. however, because the resurrected dinosaurs are only bones, they have no digestive organs. so their human meals just drop to the ground after mastication. ""i'd describe it as, 'what happens when a flying tyrannosaurus rex attacks oregon?' "" said ferguson. ""pandemonium ensues, no doubt!"" the movie's tagline reads, ""they're ancient, they're angry and they're out for revenge."" based on that description, frank conniff, ""mystery science theater 3000"" writer and current member of ""cinematic titanic"" said it could be a perfect addition to his movie riffing routine. ""i guess the central dilemma of the movie is the digestive system of these monsters. ... is rolaids or tums doing a sponsor?"" he said. ""who could not watch a movie with that description?"" conniff has made a living out of lovingly poking fun at campy, b-grade movies. he said the reason so many people love campy films is because of their originality and filmmakers' resourcefulness. ""the best of them have a real personality that comes through that you don't necessarily see in a big-budget movie,"" conniff said. big-budget science fiction movies tend to rely more on a constant barrage of noise and shiny objects instead of the charm of a campy filmmaker, like ed wood, he said. ""in some ways ['triassic attack]' could be a cheesy b movie, and in some ways it could be an action/adventure sci-fi movie,"" said jeff beach, co-founder of the production company behind ""triassic attack,"" ufo films. ""we make fun movies with a lot of visual effects and a lot of action, and there's this huge fan base for them,"" he said. ""anytime i'm out and about and people ask me what i do, i say, 'oh i make the movies for the syfy channel,' and people are like, 'oh! i love those things!' anyone from a hairdresser to a guy in a grocery store, guy parking the car. i think it's really a wide spectrum of viewers for these movies, and i think the age range also varies very much, too."" ""syfy channel is filling a void,"" ferguson said. ""people used to go to drive-ins to see these kinds of movies."" there's something about cheap entertainment that makes people smile, he said. thomas vitale, the executive vice president of programming and original movies at syfy, said the movie ""sharktopus"" made everyone on his team smile. even saying the word ""sharktopus"" was fun, he said. ""we create this world that's outlandish -- we create this world where 'sharktopus' really exists, where the military creates a sharktopus and the sharktopus gets loose,"" vitale said. ""once you set that up, everything that follows has to live within that world and has to make logical sense based on the outlandish premise that we've created."" another recent syfy movie, ""red,"" starring sci-fi fan favorite felicia day, applies that logic to the fairy tale ""little red riding hood."" vitale said it was an easy leap to go from ""a story that's about a little girl and a talking wolf,"" to an original movie that was about how a modern girl would deal with the sci-fi version of a talking wolf -- a werewolf. with such attention to detail and adherence to a fantastic story line, vitale said it's no surprise that syfy's original movie team is made up of sci-fi geeks. ""everything at syfy channel is run by robots, actually,"" said karen o'hara, vice president of original movies at syfy. ""we're all fans of the genre, we all consume a lot of science fiction, fantasy and supernatural programming,"" vitale said. ""first and foremost, we are entertainment junkies. when i was a kid, the one thing my parents were always on me about was to turn off the tv."" and while it's clear the creative team at syfy knows what traditional sci-fi fans want in terms of continuity and premise, ferguson said he believes the network is reaching out to a more mainstream audience. ""with the creation of [original syfy series] 'eureka' and 'warehouse 13,' it was like, 'no space, no aliens,' sort of grander science-type stuff. at the same time you had the mainstream [audience] getting more technical, more savvy, more sort of geeky,"" ferguson said. ""everyone is talking about iphones and ipads and knows about e-mailing this and youtube and netflixing directly,"" he added. ""it's all very sci-fi anyway in our world. so i think modern culture and technology sort of moved towards sci-fi, and syfy tried to meet them half-way."" for now, thankfully, man-eating dinosaur skeletons are still squarely in the realm of outlandish camp.",syfy channel's original movies are known for their campy fun
"(aol autos) -- if you don't eat, sleep and breathe cars, or devour car magazines in minute detail, there's a good chance you don't know all the technological terms that pop up in the media, new car advertising and literature. with new models being released all the time, the acronyms can be overwhelming. with every new model year, it seems, there are new technology and acronyms. here's a concise list of the terms you're most likely to see and read about in the 2008 literature. abs: the most common passive safety system found on cars today is abs or anti-lock brake system. abs continuously counts wheel revolutions electronically and when one or more wheels stops moving during a skid, the system quickly applies and releases the brakes on the skidding wheels. this is done so that the tires continue to rotate and the car can be steered around an object or an impending accident situation. tires that are skidding can't do much steering. als: this is a relatively new term that stands for active lighting system or automatic lighting system. on some luxury vehicles, you can opt for headlamps that turn left or right (up to about 15 degrees) as the front tires turn to light the road as you make your turns. awd (also fwd, rwd, 2wd, 4wd): these terms refer to how many and which wheels on your car deliver power from the engine to the road surface. awd means all-wheel drive and generally means there are no buttons, levers or lower gear ranges. these systems can be full-time, driving all four wheels all the time, or part-time, controlled by computers when conditions dictate the need for more traction. the 4wd label means four-wheel drive and these part-time systems usually have a selector switch or lever to select two-wheel drive, four-wheel drive or even four-wheel drive in a lower gear or locked position for very difficult driving situations. in 2wd, only the two front or rear tires have power. traditional rwd or rear-wheel drive is almost always found on luxury cars, sports cars, or racing cars. fwd or front-wheel drive is more compact and is more often found on small cars, minivans and crossover vehicles. dohc: engineering shorthand for double-overhead camshaft. a dohc engine has one camshaft that opens the intake valves and one camshaft that opens the exhaust valves, a design derived from racing engines. dohc engines are more complex than single-overhead-cam engines (sohc) and overhead-valve engines (ohv) but generally make more power and torque at higher rpm levels because they let the engine breathe better. ebd: an acronym given to the abs subsystem called electronic brake force distribution. ebd is rapidly becoming standard equipment on cars that already have abs brakes. in a panic braking situation, ebd distributes the most braking force to the tires that have the most traction. this helps to keep the car from spinning and reduces stopping distances on slippery surfaces. esc/esp: electronic stability control or electronic stability program are interchangeable terms for the same software and hardware. an extension of abs, esc uses sensors and computers to determine whether a vehicle is oversteering (rear wheels out) or understeering (front wheels not turning in the desired direction). esc/esp reduces engine power and/or applies one of the front or rear brakes to get the vehicle back into its intended path of travel. as a means of protecting against rollover accidents, esc will be required on all new light vehicles sold in america by september 2011. gps: all automotive navigation systems communicate with global positioning system or gps satellites. gps satellites were launched into orbit by the u.s. department of defense but are now used by motorists, hikers and explorers all over the world. gps systems are accurate anywhere in the world from 10 to 50 feet. combined with a cd or dvd map in the vehicle's navigation system, the satellites can track latitude, longitude, altitude and direction of travel in all weather conditions. i6 (also v6, v8, v10, w12, h4): these terms refer to the number and physical arrangement of cylinders in the engine. the i stands for inline, and means that the cylinders are lined up in a single row, (i4, i5, and i6, usually). v engines have two rows or banks of cylinders in a v pattern, with three, four, five or even six cylinders per bank, hence v-6, v-8, v-10, and v-12. the w engine used by audi and vw has three rows of cylinders, in this case four cylinders, making it a w-12. other engine designs include h-4 and h-6 engines, horizontally opposed or flat engines with either two or three cylinders on each side, a design used by porsche (engine in the rear) and subaru (engine in the front). the oddball engine on the u.s. market is the wankel, a rotary engine used only in the mazda rx-8. it has no cylinders, no banks and no reciprocating parts. l (as in 1.8l or 3.5l): l is for liters a metric measurement of engine size, also called displacement or swept volume, which has replaced cubic inches in the u.s. industry. it's the total volume of all the engine's cylinders. smaller engines generally generate less power and use less fuel, larger engines make more and use more, so don't buy more engine than you need. rsc: one of the newest government regulations proposed for vehicles in the near future is protection against rollover accidents. the system that the industry has created to combat those is generally called roll stability control. rsc uses computers and sensors to analyze vehicle speed, steering wheel angle and body angle. if it senses that the vehicle is about to roll over, it cuts engine power and applies the brakes on one side or the other to bring the vehicle back to a stable position. tcs: like abs brakes, traction control systems are becoming more widely available, even on low-priced cars, because they add so much safety. a traction control system takes data from the abs about tire rotation and compares the information in the computer. if one or two of the tires are spinning faster than they should be, indicating a loss of traction, the tcs system can cut engine power or engine torque going to the tires and apply brakes individually until the tires are all rotating at the same speed again. tpms: this is a relatively new acronym that stands for tire-pressure monitoring system. the federal government has mandated that all vehicles in the future should have these systems to protect vehicles and occupants from rollovers and other accidents caused by low or deflating tires. some currently available systems work by sending radio messages from each tire to the warning on the instrument panel. others infer from the abs system that one or more tires has a different rolling diameter, because it is going flat, than the other three tires and sends a warning to the instrument panel. vvt: engineering term that stands for variable valve timing. until a few years ago, timing the opening and closing of the engine's valves was a purely mechanical function and could not be varied. vvt systems use a combination of computers, engine oil pressure and mechanical linkages to change valve timing so that the engine idles smoothly, produces lots of power and torque when needed and burns fuel cleanly and economically.",most common car safety system is abs or anti-lock brake system
"(cnn) -- hayao miyazaki is regarded by many as the world's greatest living animator and an icon of japanese popular culture. in 2002, his work burst onto international screens with the ghostly animation ""spirited away."" it smashed box office records in japan and earned him an oscar for best animated feature. setting up studio ghibli in 1985, the 70-year-old has made 18 animated features that fuse wild fantasy with more serious issues including environmentalism and feminism. miyazaki's 2008 film ""ponyo"" featured a catastrophic tsunami, but the animator insists that including disasters in his films only makes him a realist able to highlight the fragility of life rather than a prophetic, doom-monger. ""i can't predict things, but i knew that a tsunami was coming because if you live in japan that's to be expected,"" he said. ""we just forgot that at some point a tsunami will come. even in the disaster stricken areas, people should have known, or even if they knew they probably felt that they were protected by the concrete around them."" miyazaki visited the tsunami-hit area of northeast japan four months after the disaster to screen his films to local children. surveying the devastation around the town of rikuzen-takada, he said: ""the people who are going to live here should take the time and really think about what kind of town should be rebuilt."" his own attention to detail and pain-staking approach to making his films has gained him plaudits from contemporaries like pixar's john lasseter and ""wallace and gromit"" animator nick park. but he does believe that his studio ghibli is one of a dying breed; a place where animators draw by hand and use computer animation sparingly. ""we are an extinct species maybe, an island of the galapagos, and well, (hand drawing) is the only thing i'm interested in and therefore people who are not interested in working by hand should choose another place of work."" while aware of the need to creating a functioning business with studio ghibli, miyazaki remains protective of his films -- ""all my films are all my children"" -- especially when shown to international audiences. he once sent a samurai sword to harvey weinstein who was handling the release of ""princess mononoke"" with a note attached reading: ""no cuts."" ""sometimes we have to create animation to support the studio, not have the studio to support the animation,"" he said. ""but we can't really have that approach so we have to change our mindset and say that we want to make this animation. ""just as long as there are people, there is an audience for the films we make, that is enough.""",hayao mizayaki created studio ghibli with business partner in 1985
"london (cnn)mohammed emwazi: the world knows him better as ""jihadi john,"" the man whose masked face and british accented-taunts have featured in a series of brutal isis execution videos. but many of those who grew up with him have told the uk media that remember emwazi altogether differently: as the typical ""boy next door,"" a popular kid who loved football, pop music and the simpsons. a day after the long-standing mystery behind jihadi john's identity was solved, clues to his past have begun to emerge -- but far from showing him as a violent extremist, they paint a picture of an ordinary child and teenager growing up in the british capital. emwazi was born in kuwait in 1988, and moved to the uk with his parents, jasem and ghaneya, and sister at the age of six, according to cage, an advocacy group for those affected by terrorism investigations. the family settled down in west london; emwazi's father is reported to have worked as a taxi driver, while his mother stayed at home to look after emwazi and his siblings. he is reported to have attended st mary magdalene church of england primary school, in london's maida vale; a photograph published on the front pages of several british newspapers showed a smiling young boy in the school's scarlet sweater uniform, surrounded by his classmates and teacher -- a far cry from the black-clad jihadi infamous around the world. when contacted by cnn, the school's headteacher refused to comment. on its website, the school -- whose motto is ""believe, achieve and succeed together"" -- proudly proclaims: ""we are a very inclusive, multicultural and diverse school, where many languages and religions reside happily under one roof."" a former classmate there told the daily mail newspaper that emwazi was sporty and popular, but had initially struggled with english: ""he could only say a few words at first, like his name and where he was from. ""he played football every lunchtime and at the after-school football club. through football, he learned different words and expressions."" the paper reported that, writing in a class yearbook aged 10, emwazi told of his love for pop group s club 7, the simpsons, the shoot-'em-up computer game duke nukem and -- like so many other british children -- listed his favourite food as chips. another friend from st mary magdalene told radio station lbc: ""i used to go with him to that primary school ... i do remember him very well ... i was a year younger than him and he treated me as someone he used to teach."" the man, who was identified only as mohammed, said the pair's mothers had been ""very good friends"" until three years ago when rumors began to circulate about emwazi's terror links. ""his mum used to sell gold and stuff like that to the local community."" mohammed and another former classmate both said they have vivid memories of a painful injury sustained by the youngster when he was in the final year of primary school. ""in the playground ... he was just about to get into a fight and he was running away from someone ... another guy tried to block off his path. he had nowhere to go and he basically ran into the goalposts, hit his head onto a metal goalpost and fell to the floor,"" mohammed told lbc, adding that his friend missed two weeks of classes and ""he was not the same, ever since that brain injury."" londoner matt seton wrote on twitter that he went to school with emwazi: ""he was a 12 year old kid ... i remember one [time] we were playing football and he smashed his head on the goalpost. now he kills people for a living."" after leaving st mary magdalene, emwazi is believed to have moved on to the quintin kynaston academy in neighboring st. john's wood, whose alumni include singers tulisa contostavolos and shola ama; his sister later became a prefect there. one of his classmates -- speaking on condition of anonymity -- told the daily telegraph newspaper he was a ""typical north-west london boy.""

"-- frank dipascali, formerly the finance chief at bernard madoff's investment advisory business, pleaded guilty in federal court in manhattan on tuesday to 10 charges including securities fraud and international money laundering. frank dipascali, center in this courtroom sketch, said he knew for about 20 years he was engaged in wrongdoing. the charges carry a maximum sentence of 125 years. with his guilty plea, dipascali waived his right to a trial. as tuesday's hearing commenced, u.s. district judge richard j. sullivan explained that for him to accept dipascali's guilty plea, dipascali would have to sufficiently convince him that he was, in fact, guilty. that set the stage for a dramatic statement from dipascali about his history at madoff's firm, his personal relationship with madoff, and the mechanics of a multibillion-dollar ponzi scheme for which madoff was convicted in june. while dipascali's guilty plea and the judge's acceptance of it were expected, both the defense and the prosecution were surprised by the judge's decision to reject dipascali's bail agreement -- and to have him escorted from the courtroom in handcuffs. the defense and even the prosecution pleaded with the judge not to order dipascali into custody. prosecutors told the judge they believed remanding dipascali would impede the ""efficiency"" of their madoff investigation. marc mukasey, the lead defense attorney, stood multiple times to dispute the decision, variously suggesting to the judge that dipascali instead be put under house detention, that he wear an electronic monitoring device, and that the decision on his bail agreement be postponed for 48 to 72 hours. he added that dipascali's family was ""completely unprepared"" for this outcome. while sullivan patiently heard out mukasey's many counterproposals, he refused to back down from his decision, asserting that dipascali was too serious a flight risk given the ""astronomical"" maximum sentence he may receive. the judge also said that he could not ""overlook the conduct [dipascali] admitted to"" despite dipascali's avowed determination to do the right thing henceforth. though dipascali remained outwardly calm for much of tuesday's proceedings, the judge's decision not to grant him bail appeared to stun him. he seemed in a daze as it became clear he would leave the courtroom in handcuffs, cupping his head in his hands and rubbing his temples. earlier in his testimony, dipascali recounted how he joined madoff's company as a newly minted high-school grad in 1975. he held numerous jobs during his 33-year tenure -- options trader and research analyst among them -- but above all he was a ""guy who did whatever he was told to do around the office."" working side by side with madoff for decades, dipascali developed a tight bond with his employer. ""bernie was a mentor to me and more,"" he said, adding that he was ""loyal to a terrible, terrible fault."" his sense of loyalty led him to falsify documents for his boss for years on end, he said. using a financial program, he looked up historical prices of stocks and then drafted customer statements showing bogus stock transactions. he calculated theoretical commissions that the business should have received from the trades that it did not actually make, and then wired money from account to account to make those commissions appear, he said. and as a principal point of contact for investors in madoff's investment advisory business, dipascali said, he also regularly fielded calls from investors curious about how their money was being managed, knowing that the trades he told them about were entirely fictitious. he said he had been aware that what he was doing was wrong since the ""late '80s, early '90s."" ""i don't know how i went from an 18-year-old kid who happened to have a job [to] standing in front of you today,"" he said. dipascali repeatedly stated that he perpetrated the massive fraud in collusion ""with others,"" though he specified neither who those other were nor how many they numbered. dipascali said he rationalized to himself that madoff's victims would have a soft landing if the ponzi scheme ever came crumbling down. he said he thought madoff had assets he could liquefy in a worst-case scenario. ""i know my apology means nothing,"" dipascali said. his voice quavered as he expressed remorse for his part in swindling charities that had invested with madoff. miriam siegman, a madoff victim who said she lost 40 years' worth of personal savings in the scheme and was now on the brink of homelessness, asked the judge to reject dipascali's guilty plea. she insisted that the ""full truth"" would come out only if dipascali stood trial. both legal teams said they expected sentencing to happen in may. each side will have the opportunity to submit documents and testimonies in support of or against dipascali before sullivan hands down the sentence. dipascali is the second person involved in the madoff scheme to land behind bars as a result of the fraud. in june, madoff pleaded guilty to 11 counts and was sentenced to 150 years in prison for masterminding the scheme. prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud committed by a single person, totaling billions in losses to investors.","new: judge denies bail for frank dipascali, despite deal he had with prosecutors"

""thanks to all the fans and friends for your continued prayers and support as randy continues on the road to recovery,"" his fiance mary davis said in a written statement wednesday. travis, 54, was initially hospitalized july 7 at baylor medical center at mckinney, texas, with a presumptive cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, according to publicist kirt webster. the singer transferred to the heart hospital the next day. travis' illness is related to his ""recently acquired viral cardiomyopathy,"" one of his doctors said. viral cardiomyopathy is a disorder where a virus attacks the muscles of the heart, causing the heart to beat slower, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention's website. in some cases, the heart can stop, it said. travis had a tough year in 2012 with arrests for assault and public intoxication, which earned him probation. travis was at the forefront of the ""new traditionalist"" movement in the 1980s and 1990s, but he faded as the '90s wore on. he made a comeback after turning to gospel music in 1999. his song ""three wooden crosses"" won song of the year in 2003 from both the country music association and the academy of country music.",travis entered a texas hospital for treatment of congestive heart failure on july 7
"-- an ohio death row inmate was executed tuesday after the supreme court rejected his last-minute plea that he was too overweight to be put to death. richard cooey, 41, and an accomplice were convicted of the 1986 murders of two college students. richard cooey was pronounced dead at 10:28 a.m. et, said andrea carson, spokeswoman for the ohio department of corrections. the execution went as scheduled, she said, with ""no problems whatsoever."" cooey had exhausted his legal appeals and gov. ted strickland earlier denied the 41-year-old prisoner's clemency petition. cooey murdered two college students in 1986. asked if he had any final words, carson quoted cooey as saying, ""you haven't paid attention to anything i've had to say for the past 22 years, so why would you think that i would think you're going to pay attention to what i have to say now?"" earlier tuesday, the supreme court rejected the stay cooey's attorneys had sought, along with the opportunity to address the larger constitutional claims over when a convicted person is medically unfit for capital punishment. the court was also asked to review whether ohio's lethal injection procedures amount to cruel and unusual punishment. cooey's lawyers maintained that at 5-foot-7 and 267 pounds, he was ""morbidly obese"" and had gained about 70 pounds since he was imprisoned at age 19. prison food and confinement in his cell for 23 hours a day, limiting his opportunities for exercise, contributed to his weight problem, his legal team argued. cooey also contended regular medication he took for migraines would weaken the effectiveness of an anesthetic used in the three-drug cocktail administered during execution. he said his veins were weakened because of his health issues, and the lethal drugs would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. a federal appeals court ruled thursday that cooey waited too long raise the medical issues, saying he ""knew of and could have filed suit over vein access prior to july 2005."" ohio does not serve a ""last meal,"" as death-row inmates are given the opportunity to eat breakfast before a scheduled execution, carson told cnn. but on monday night, she said, cooey ate a ""special meal"" consisting of a t-bone steak, hash browns, french fries, four eggs over easy, onion rings, four pieces of toast, a pint of rocky road ice cream, mountain dew and bear claw pastries. he did not eat breakfast tuesday, carson said. cooey and a then-17-year-old accomplice were convicted of the brutal murders of wendy offredo and dawn mccreery, students at the university of akron. the men had been tossing concrete slabs onto interstate 77, and one of them struck offredo's car. pretending to ""rescue"" the women, cooey and clinton dickens took the victims to a remote field, according to prosecutors. there the students were subjected to a three-and-a-half-hour period of rape, torture, stabbings and fatal bludgeonings. cooey carved an ""x"" into the stomachs of both women, prosecutors said. each man blamed the other for delivering the fatal blows, but both were convicted of murder. dickens received a life sentence because of his age. cooey tried to escape from death row in 2005, when corrections officials said he constructed a ladder from magazines and bed sheets in an effort to scale the barrier around an outdoor recreation area. at an august clemency hearing, jon offredo, brother of one of the victims, said, ""our family has never gotten an apology from richard cooey. we've gotten blatant lies and excuses. is an apology too much to ask? how could he commit such an heinous act and not feel regret?"" however, cooey's lawyer, dana cole, said his client is sorry for his crimes. the high court has not offered clear guidelines on what medical standards need to be met before an inmate is eligible for death. but in a case five years ago, the justices allowed inmates to at least make a claim that their specific physical or medical issues could be cause to block an execution. the high court had sided with a convicted alabama killer who claimed his veins were so damaged from years of drug abuse that executioners might have to cut deeply into his flesh to administer the deadly drugs. writing for the unanimous court in that case, then-justice sandra day o'connor said the court was not going to ""open the floodgates to all manner of method-of-execution challenges,"" as alabama feared. ""our holding is extremely limited."" that inmate is still on death row. richard dieter of the death penalty information center, a data-resource group that opposes capital punishment, said the supreme court indicated that ""how you're going to be executed is a civil rights matter, the same as if you were discriminated on the basis of race or gender or something like that."" a washington state killer was given a reprieve in 1994 after claiming he was too obese to hang. mitchell rupe at one time was more than 425 pounds, but weight-loss surgery in prison had reduced that to 275 pounds over the years. subsequent legal efforts to execute him failed. he died in prison two years ago after a long illness. the ohio case is cooey v. kerns (08-6722). cnn supreme court producer bill mears contributed to this report.",richard cooey executed as scheduled tuesday morning
"-- forty-four years after the rev. martin luther king jr. was gunned down on the balcony of a memphis hotel, the tennessee city is overcoming what some call protracted guilt and embarrassment, and naming a street in his honor. a nearly 1-mile stretch of linden avenue will be renamed dr. m.l. king jr. avenue on wednesday, the anniversary of the civil rights leader's assassination. the honor has been a long time coming. more than 900 u.s. cities have streets named after king. the largest concentration is in the south, led by georgia, which has more than 70 roads named after the atlanta native, according to an article by derek h. alderman of east carolina university in the new georgia encyclopedia. but in the city where he died, the omission has been, to many, glaring. ""we never wanted to address losing dr. king's life here,"" said former memphis city councilman berlin boyd, who helped lead the street-naming effort. born and raised in memphis, boyd, 34, said he always wondered why there was no official street tribute for king. during his brief five-month term in a vacated council seat -- from august to january -- boyd decided to get the ball rolling. ""i had the opportunity to do something, and we got it done,"" boyd said. the east-west linden avenue, while less famous than beale street with its many blues clubs and restaurants just a block north, was selected because that was where king marched in support of striking sanitation workers. the avenue also was a pivotal location during the strike. a photo shows the civil rights leader on linden, boyd said. the council proposal was approved earlier this year by a land-use control board. ""he marched along this street; we wanted something that had a real nexus to this city,"" said mayor a.c. wharton. one of dr. king's associates during the 1968 sanitation workers' march was the rev. james netters, a former city council member. netters advocated for an intersection in honor of king in the early 1970s; the council decided to rename a portion of interstate 240 as a substitute, he said. ""naming linden is better than nothing,"" netters said. the downtown thoroughfare is close to the historic clayborn-ball temple, a focal point for many meetings of the sanitation strikers. king was scheduled to speak there on april 3, 1968, but, because of a large crowd, the rally was moved to mason temple. it was there that he delivered his famous ""i've been to the mountaintop"" address. linden avenue is a busy downtown thoroughfare and is on one side of fedexforum, home of the nba's memphis grizzlies. the area around the street is undergoing a significant transformation, wharton said. ""this is the right time"" to rename the street, the mayor said. demolition of a public housing project is making way for a mixed-use development, and other projects will change the landscape. long-term plans include naming up to 5 miles of linden avenue for king. king was killed april 4, 1968, by james earl ray. the national civil rights museum, located at the lorraine motel where he was killed, will sponsor a commemoration on the anniversary date. the rev. jesse jackson, who was with king at the lorraine, said the assassination left memphis with a deep sense of pain and guilt. he contends the city could ""do more to memorialize dr. king's legacy."" for the city, the street naming is a large symbolic step in honoring king. ""there is no way we could do enough for him ... that would measure up to what he gave up the united states of america,"" wharton said.",a 1-mile stretch of linden avenue will be named after the civil rights leader

""these are actually the kinds of things that 10 years from now, 20 years from now, we're going to look back and say it really made a difference,"" obama said. the initiative was founded by former astronaut sally ride, former intel chairman craig barrett, xerox ceo ursula burns, time warner cable ceo glenn britt, and eastman kodak ceo antonio perez, with support from the bill and melinda gates foundation and the carnegie corporation of new york, according to the white house statement. ride told cnn on thursday that american students need new inspiration to learn the so-called stem subjects -- science, technology, engineering and math -- to compete in the global workforce and help restore the united states as a leader in innovative research and development. ""for the last 20 to 25 years, our society really hasn't put a focus on the importance of math and science education. we're starting to pay the price,"" ride said, noting that the united states has slipped in global rankings of math and science literacy among students. the goals of change the equation are to improve teaching in stem subjects, inspire student learning in those subjects and achieve a national commitment to improve education in them, according to the white house. obama said achieving them is vital for the nation's future economic success and vitality. ""the cost of inaction is immeasurable,"" obama said, citing the lost participation of children who never get encouraged or exposed to education in stem subjects. some programs under the initiative would expand summer science camps for girls, allow more students to take part in robotics competitions, increase teacher training, and help students take advanced placement courses in math and science, the white house statement said. obama also announced new public-private partnerships promoting better stem education, including a robotics competition for students. ride said business leaders were motivated to create the new initiative because ""they realize their future depends on it,"" noting that ""80 percent of jobs of the next decade are going to require some background, some basic skills in math and science."" ""we do need inspiration for the kids growing up today,"" ride said. ""the space program did it for my generation. maybe it will do it for the next generation."" another goal is to ""humanize"" the subjects of science, math and engineering, ride said, so that kids ""don't think all scientists are old dead guys.""",the change the equation initiative involves 100 ceos

"one day after south korea staged exercises near yeonpyeong island marking the anniversary of north korea's deadly shelling, the north's military threatened ""a sea of fire"" upon the south's presidential office, the south's yonhap news agency reported thursday. a year ago wednesday, north korea launched an attack on the civilian island of yeonpyeong, killing two marines and two civilians and shattering the sense of security that south koreans had enjoyed for almost 60 years. the island shelling came half a year after north korea torpedoed a naval ship, the cheonan, killing 46 sailors. north korea's military supreme command denounced the south's anniversary exercise as a rehearsal for war against the north and warned that the north's armed forces are ready for ""a decisive battle to counter any military provocation,"" yonhap reported. if south korea dares ""to impair the dignity of (the north) again and fire one bullet or shell toward its inviolable territorial waters, sky and land, the deluge of fire on yonphyong island will lead to that in chongwadae and the sea of fire in chongwadae to the deluge of fire sweeping away the stronghold of the group of traitors,"" the command said in an official (north) korean central news agency account, according to yonhap. the north korean statement used a different spelling for both the shelled south korean island and cheong wa dae, korea's presidential offices, yonhap reported. south korea's defense ministry had no immediate comment, yonhap reported. north korea invoked identical rhetoric in 1994, when pyongyang had expelled international nuclear inspectors and threatened to turn seoul into a ""sea of fire."" with the united states mulling air strikes on north korean facilities in 1994, former u.s. president jimmy carter flew into pyongyang to meet kim il sung, and that set the scene for the so-called ""agreed framework"" under which north korea would give up its nuclear facilities in return for light water reactors from the international community.",north korea makes 'sea of fire' threat after south korea holds exercises
"editor's note: jeffrey a. miron is senior lecturer in economics at harvard university. a libertarian, he was one of 166 academic economists who signed a letter to congressional leaders last week opposing the government bailout plan. economist jeffrey miron says the bailout plan presented to congress was the wrong solution to the crisis -- congress has balked at the bush administration's proposed $700 billion bailout of wall street. under this plan, the treasury would have bought the ""troubled assets"" of financial institutions in an attempt to avoid economic meltdown. this bailout was a terrible idea. here's why. the current mess would never have occurred in the absence of ill-conceived federal policies. the federal government chartered fannie mae in 1938 and freddie mac in 1970; these two mortgage lending institutions are at the center of the crisis. the government implicitly promised these institutions that it would make good on their debts, so fannie and freddie took on huge amounts of excessive risk. worse, beginning in 1977 and even more in the 1990s and the early part of this century, congress pushed mortgage lenders and fannie/freddie to expand subprime lending. the industry was happy to oblige, given the implicit promise of federal backing, and subprime lending soared. this subprime lending was more than a minor relaxation of existing credit guidelines. this lending was a wholesale abandonment of reasonable lending practices in which borrowers with poor credit characteristics got mortgages they were ill-equipped to handle. once housing prices declined and economic conditions worsened, defaults and delinquencies soared, leaving the industry holding large amounts of severely depreciated mortgage assets. the fact that government bears such a huge responsibility for the current mess means any response should eliminate the conditions that created this situation in the first place, not attempt to fix bad government with more government. the obvious alternative to a bailout is letting troubled financial institutions declare bankruptcy. bankruptcy means that shareholders typically get wiped out and the creditors own the company. bankruptcy does not mean the company disappears; it is just owned by someone new (as has occurred with several airlines). bankruptcy punishes those who took excessive risks while preserving those aspects of a businesses that remain profitable. in contrast, a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending. thus, the bailout encourages companies to take large, imprudent risks and count on getting bailed out by government. this ""moral hazard"" generates enormous distortions in an economy's allocation of its financial resources. thoughtful advocates of the bailout might concede this perspective, but they argue that a bailout is necessary to prevent economic collapse. according to this view, lenders are not making loans, even for worthy projects, because they cannot get capital. this view has a grain of truth; if the bailout does not occur, more bankruptcies are possible and credit conditions may worsen for a time. talk of armageddon, however, is ridiculous scare-mongering. if financial institutions cannot make productive loans, a profit opportunity exists for someone else. this might not happen instantly, but it will happen. further, the current credit freeze is likely due to wall street's hope of a bailout; bankers will not sell their lousy assets for 20 cents on the dollar if the government might pay 30, 50, or 80 cents. the costs of the bailout, moreover, are almost certainly being understated. the administration's claim is that many mortgage assets are merely illiquid, not truly worthless, implying taxpayers will recoup much of their $700 billion. if these assets are worth something, however, private parties should want to buy them, and they would do so if the owners would accept fair market value. far more likely is that current owners have brushed under the rug how little their assets are worth. the bailout has more problems. the final legislation will probably include numerous side conditions and special dealings that reward washington lobbyists and their clients. anticipation of the bailout will engender strategic behavior by wall street institutions as they shuffle their assets and position their balance sheets to maximize their take. the bailout will open the door to further federal meddling in financial markets. so what should the government do? eliminate those policies that generated the current mess. this means, at a general level, abandoning the goal of home ownership independent of ability to pay. this means, in particular, getting rid of fannie mae and freddie mac, along with policies like the community reinvestment act that pressure banks into subprime lending. the right view of the financial mess is that an enormous fraction of subprime lending should never have occurred in the first place. someone has to pay for that. that someone should not be, and does not need to be, the u.s. taxpayer. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.",jeffrey miron: government encouraged lenders to relax their standards
"-- a new strain of avian flu that jumped from birds to mammals is responsible for the death of more than 160 seals off the new england coast last year, scientists announced tuesday. the virus could theoretically pose a threat to human health, they said. harbor seals -- most of them babies less than 6 months old -- began appearing with severe pneumonia and skin lesions in september of last year, the researchers said. over the next few months, at least 162 dead seals were recovered along the coast from maine to massachusetts, they said. mutant bird flu would be airborne, scientists say testing pointed at a new strain of the h3n8 flu virus being called seal h3n8. ""when initial tests revealed an avian influenza virus, we asked the obvious question: how did this virus jump from birds to seals?"" lead researcher simon anthony of columbia university said. the virus developed the ability to attack mammalian respiratory tracts, scientists learned. it may also have developed enhanced virulence and transmission in mammals, they said, but they need to do more tests to be sure. avian flu has spread to humans before, most notably h1n1 and h5n1, so the new strain could pose a threat to public health, scientists warned. ""hiv/aids, sars, west nile, nipah and influenza are all examples of emerging infectious diseases that originated in animals,"" said w. ian lipkin, director of the center for infection and immunity at columbia university. ""any outbreak of disease in domestic animals or wildlife, while an immediate threat to wildlife conservation, must also be considered potentially hazardous to humans,"" he said. the research is published in the journal mbio. it was carried out by scientists from the center for infection & immunity at columbia university's mailman school of public health, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, new england aquarium, the usgs national wildlife health center, seaworld and ecohealth alliance. cnn's miriam falco contributed to this report.","a new strain of avian flu has mutated and is killing baby seals, scientists say"
"-- a florida task force on friday recommended that the state's controversial ""stand your ground"" law not be overturned. the body, appointed by florida gov. rick scott, found that the ""majority of floridians favor an expansive right to self-defense."" the law states that a person is permitted to use force in self-defense without first having to retreat from a potentially dangerous situation. ""all persons who are conducting themselves in a lawful manner have a fundamental right to stand their ground and defend themselves from attack with proportionate force in every place they have a lawful right to be,"" the 44-page report said. since its enactment in florida in 2006, the law has been frequently cited in cases ranging from an incident in which a man sprayed a vehicle carrying a known gang member with 14 bullets to the 2011 case of a man who was cleared under ""stand your ground"" after stabbing a man in the head with an ice pick during a road rage incident. the number of justifiable homicides reported in the state has skyrocketed since the law went into effect. in the five years before the law's approval, florida averaged 12 justifiable homicides a year, according to the florida department of law enforcement. in the six years since, the average is 33. scott formed the task force on march 22 in response to the fatal shooting of trayvon martin, an unarmed teenager. martin was killed by george zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in sanford, florida, after a confrontation. the incident sparked national outcry, prompted a justice department investigation and raised questions about the controversial law.","the body found that the ""majority of floridians favor an expansive right to self-defense"""
"new research shows a major section of west antarctica's ice sheet will completely melt in coming centuries and probably raise sea levels higher than previously predicted, revealing another impact from the world's changing climate. according to a study released monday, warm ocean currents and geographic peculiarities have helped kick off a chain reaction at the amundsen sea-area glaciers, melting them faster than previously realized and pushing them ""past the point of no return,"" nasa glaciologist eric rignot told reporters. the glacial retreat there ""appears unstoppable,"" said rignot, lead author of a joint nasa-university of california irvine paper that used 40 years of satellite data and aircraft studies. nasa says the region has enough ice to raise global sea levels by 4 feet. according to rignot, conservative estimates indicate the complete melting of the antarctic ice cited in the study could take several centuries. however, the melting could have an impact this century, according to sridhar anandakrishnan, a geosciences professor at pennsylvania state university. the united nations' most recent climate change report estimated sea levels could rise from about 1 foot to 3 feet by 2100. such a rise could displace tens of millions of people from coastal areas around the world. anandakrishnan said the u.n. estimate largely didn't take into account the melting ice sheet from west antarctica, because few studies for that area had been completed. ""so as this paper and others come out, the (u.n.) numbers for 2100 will almost certainly"" lean closer to 3 feet, he said. why scientists think it's unstoppable the rate at which the area's ice is melting has increased 77% since 1973, and there are several reasons, researchers said. the ice sheet there, unlike those in much of east antarctica, is attached to a bed below sea level. that means ocean currents can deliver warm water at the glaciers' base, or grounding lines -- places where the ice attaches to the bed, nasa said. the heat makes the grounding line retreat inland, leaving a less massive ice shelf above. when ice shelves lose mass, they can't hold back inland glaciers from flowing toward the sea. glaciers then flow faster and become thin as a result, and this thinning is conducive to more grounding-line retreat, nasa said. ""the system (becomes) a chain reaction that is unstoppable, (with) every process of retreat feeding the next one,"" rignot said. iceberg is twice the size of atlanta a hill or a mountain behind the grounding line would slow this retreat. but the beds behind nearly all the amundsen sea glaciers slope downward, researchers said. rignot said he believes climate change and a depletion of the earth's ozone layer are partly to blame, saying they have changed the winds in the area to cause more warm water to go toward the glaciers. climate change skeptics, many backed by a huge campaign funded by the fossil fuels industry, seek to undermine research findings on the impacts of what is popularly referred to as global warming. they challenge the scientific validity of climate change, as well as the role of human-produced pollution in contributing to it. for example, such opponents of policies to reduce u.s. carbon emissions say the severe north american winter that just ended and evidence of increasing antarctic sea ice defied the claims by scientists of a warming planet. however, rignot and anandakrishnan said their findings on the west antarctica ice shelf don't clash with news of the record levels of antarctic sea ice. they noted that sea ice forms and melts quickly, while glaciers are subject to longer-term change. rignot added that the same winds that stir subsurface heat toward the base of antarctic ice shelf also can expand sea ice cover. not a first such a melting would be uncommon, but not necessarily unprecedented, anandakrishnan said. evidence shows that west antarctica retained an ice sheet during the last few 100,000-year cycles of glacial formation and retreat, he said. but evidence also suggests the entire west antarctica ice sheet might have melted 500,000 to 600,000 years ago, anandakrishnan said. the six amundsen sea glaciers are just a portion of the entire west antarctic ice sheet. though much of the other west antarctic sections are grounded below sea level, the amundsen sea area is more vulnerable, in part because it has fewer hills behind the leading edges and because the shape of the sea floor helps usher more warm water to the base, nasa said. anandakrishnan said it was possible that the melting in the amundsen sea area could destabilize other ice sheets. the entire west antarctic ice sheet has enough ice to raise the global sea level by about 16 feet, nasa said.","warm currents, other factors have caused chain reaction, nasa says"
"-- spanish football giants barcelona have confirmed they have signed a huge new shirt sponsorship deal with the non-profit qatar foundation -- the first time they have received money to display a logo on their jerseys in the club's history. revealing the news on their official website, the primera liga champions could be in line to receive up to 170 million euros ($225m) for the five-and-a-half year deal, which incorporates commercial and image rights as well as various bonuses relating to success on the field. children's charity unicef has appeared on the club's shirts in recent seasons and their logo will continue to feature prominently. however, kit manufacturer nike will now redesign the jerseys to accomodate the name of the qatar foundation -- an organization set up in 1995 to improve education and community development in qatar and the surrounding region. following the news, unicef released a statement, saying: ""the groundbreaking partnership between unicef and fc barcelona advanced the global message on the importance of children's issues in a unique way. ""unicef is looking forward to the next stage of the collaboration and is exploring various options."" barcelona also released a breakdown of how the funds will be received, with the club getting 15m euros ($20m) for the second half of the season and 30m euros ($40m) for each of the following five seasons -- with up to 5m euros ($7m) in bonuses for any titles won. the funds will provide a welcome boost for barcelona, who have struggled financially, despite all their successes on the pitch. the catalan club made a loss of 80m euros ($105m) last season and are reported to have debts in the region of 440m euros. the announcement also continues qatar's increasing influence in world football following their recent winning bid to host the 2022 world cup finals.",barcelona sign a huge new shirt sponsorship deal with the non-profit qatar foundation
"-- michael bloomberg signed a bill monday to regulate the use of electronic cigarettes -- one of 22 bills he signed at city hall that are the last he will sign as mayor of new york city, according to evelyn erskine, his deputy press secretary. the legislation amends the smoke-free air act, which bans smoking in public places such as restaurants, bars, parks, beaches and places of employment. it now additionally prohibits the use of electronic cigarettes in all areas where smoking is prohibited. e-cigarettes will still be permitted in areas where smoking is allowed, in addition to retail e-cigarette stores and vapor lounges. e-cigarettes are ""battery-operated products that turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and/or chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user,"" according to food and drug administration spokesperson jennifer haliski. unlike a regular cigarette, there's no tobacco burned and when users inhale, instead of smoke, there's a steam-like vapor. some e-cigarette devices claim to help people kick their smoking habit, but bloomberg said he's not convinced and it's just another way to inhale nicotine. ""it works about as well as patches, which is to say it really doesn't work,"" he said. a pro-smoking activist read a brief statement lobbying against the bill, saying smoking is within a person's legal private life and not public health. ""you don't own me like state property,"" the lobbyist said to bloomberg as she took out a cigarette from her pocket and lit up. the woman was escorted out of the meeting immediately afterward. aaron david ross told cnn's poppy harlow he smoked cigarettes for 10 years. while he's still addicted to nicotine, he hasn't smoked a cigarette for two and a half years. he credits kicking the bad habit to e-cigarettes. ross said he worries many americans are so opposed to smoking that they're stigmatizing something some say could save lives. thomas glynn, director of cancer science and trends at the american cancer society, said that e-cigarette users should smoke with ""cautious optimism."" ""anyone who uses an e-cigarette right now does not know what they're inhaling,"" glynn said. ""what we don't want to do is to take something out of the hands of people which could in fact help people stop using the traditional burn cigarette, which is the enemy."" there are no e-cigarette devices regulated by any federal body, and e-cigarettes are not an fda-approved method to quit smoking. a 2010 court decision, which the fda agreed to abide by, held that if e-cigarette companies stopped making therapeutic claims, their products would not be regulated by the fda, according to haliski. right now, the fda's center for tobacco products -- established in 2009 by the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act -- has the authority to only regulate certain categories of ""tobacco products,"" which exclusively applies to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless tobacco, according to haliski. the fda intends to propose a rule deeming any product that meets the definition of a ""tobacco product"" under the act to be subject to fda's regulatory authority. the fda also intends to propose a regulation that would extend the agency's ""tobacco product"" authorities to other categories of tobacco products that meet the statutory definition of ""tobacco product,"" haliski told cnn. ""further research is needed to assess the potential public health benefits and risk of electronic cigarettes and other novel tobacco products,"" haliski said. the fda declined to comment on the newly signed bill in new york. bloomberg signed another controversial bill at the final meeting of the legislative session, which requires the department of sanitation commissioner to determine the recyclability of expanded polystyrene foam, leading to the potential ban of the material from food services establishments, mobile food commissaries and retail stores beginning july 1, 2015. ""all of the environmental stuff, the payoff isn't for years, but it's what makes the city habitable and keeps us safe,"" bloomberg said. poppy harlow and laura dolan contributed to this report",michael bloomberg signs his last 22 bills as new york city mayor

"(ew.com) -- i've lost count, but ""after earth"" seems like it must be the fourth post-apocalyptic thriller this month. the movie teams will smith and his son, jaden smith, and it was directed by m. night shyamalan, the former maestro-huckster of the twist ending. but shyamalan's star has fallen, and he has become a glorified gun for hire. the movie takes off from a concept as basic as a videogame, and it sticks to that concept, without surprise. in the dystopian future, the human race has been forced to abandon a toxic earth overrun by snappy-jawed monsters that look like they came out of a starship troopers sequel. will smith plays cypher, a military ranger famous for his total absence of fear (that's why he's invincible to the monsters, who stalk their prey by smelling fear), and jaden plays his upstart ranger-cadet son, kitai, who is traveling with him on an interplanetary mission. when an asteroid storm forces the ship to crash-land on earth, cypher is badly injured, and it's up to kitai to travel a hundred kilometers on foot, all to retrieve a homing beacon. but his father, who can see what kitai sees through a digital transmission, talks to him as if he were a videogame avatar, guiding the kid through his trek to manhood. we're not used to seeing will smith shorn of his lightness and humor, but in ""after earth,"" he's solemn and heavy-lidded, and he speaks with grave deliberation, never even using contractions. he tries to make cypher a kind of obi-wan figure, and smith is charismatic enough to pull this off, but the father-son, mentor/disciple relationship is better than the rest of the film, which is like a plate of sci-fi leftovers. the knives have been out for jaden smith, who is routinely dismissed by blogosphere snark as a lucky-duck celebrity offspring whose dad will do anything to make him a star. i'm someone who thinks that jaden smith has a lot of talent; his moody melancholy held that ""karate kid"" remake together. but a movie like after earth, in which he mostly has to act all by himself, taking orders from his father as he dodges post-apocalyptic clichã©s, isn't doing him any favors. grade: c+ see the original story at ew.com. click here to try 2 risk free issues of entertainment weekly © 2011 entertainment weekly and time inc. all rights reserved.","""after earth"" is directed by m. night shyamalan"
"-- a wildfire scorching southern california prompted authorities to urge thousands to evacuate on tuesday, though authorities appear to have gotten a better grip on the blaze as the day wore on. ""at the point that the fire is right now, we have a pretty good handle on it,"" san diego fire chief javier mainar told reporters early tuesday evening. ""we hope to do some more work through the night and into tomorrow, but i think that the largest part of the emergency has passed."" at one point late tuesday afternoon, san diego county announced on twitter and its emergency department website that ""more than 20,000 homes and residences are being evacuated due to the bernardo fire."" but in a news conference tuesday evening, county sheriff bill gore that only 5,000 evacuation notices had been issued; he said that the 20,000 number may have come from an assumption of four people in each residence. authorities initially said that most of the evacuations were in san diego city limits. but by the evening, san diego police chief shelley zimmerman estimated about 300 homes were still evacuated in select areas. earlier, parents were told to pick up their children from three elementary schools because of the fire and an evacuation center was moved from one high school to another. mainar, though, said he didn't see any reason now why classes in those elementary schools would not resume wednesday. the fire began at 10:45 a.m. (1:45 p.m. et), fanned by strong winds, according to the fire chief. ""it has been, to say the least, a very challenging day for local fire agencies and law enforcement agencies,"" mainar said. ""it is unusual in may to have wind driven fires like this that prove to be such a challenge to contain."" for all those challenges, authorities said they don't know of any injuries or fatalities tied to the blaze. it had burned 800 acres and was 5% contained as of 7:50 p.m., according to calfire. the national weather service issued a red flag warning for areas around san diego through 8 p.m. wednesday. as the agency noted, ""a red flag warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will shortly,"" with strong winds, low humidity and warm temperatures feeding into ""extreme fire behavior."" temperatures in the southern california city are forecast to peak in the mid-90s wednesday and thursday with no sign of rain, before cooling somewhat later in the week. cnn's matthew stucker contributed to this report.","new: fire chief: ""the largest part of the emergency has passed"""
"-- in november 2008, after an ugly campaign that stirred emotions and split families along generational lines, california voters narrowly approved proposition 8. the ballot initiative defined marriage as between a man and a woman and banned same-sex marriage in the golden state. now, as the supreme court hears arguments from those challenging the law's constitutionality, we californians have a message for the rest of the country: ""oops. never mind."" a new field poll, released at the end of february, provides the evidence of what many of us here on the left coast have been sensing over the last 4â½ years: when it comes to same-sex marriage, many california voters want a do-over. the survey shows that 61% of california voters now approve of it, with 32% opposed. the ""pro"" figure represents a big jump from 2008 when the field poll showed that 51% of california voters approved of same sex-marriage. it's part of what has been a gradual march toward greater public acceptance of same-sex marriage in a state that has struggled with this issue like no other in recent memory. i know this struggle. i went through it myself. thirteen years ago, i opposed same-sex marriage and supported the watered-down alternative -- civil unions. as a practical matter, i thought activists should focus on things such as a federal civil rights bill outlawing private-sector discrimination due to sexual orientation. then a gay family member helped me see the light. i now understand that we can't have a two-tiered system, where some of us enjoy the right to marry and our brothers and sisters and cousins don't, based solely on sexual orientation. opinion: straight marriage is the real issue california's struggle started about the same time. in 2000, another ballot initiative -- proposition 22, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman -- was approved by 61% of california voters. note that this is the same percentage that, in the current field poll, says they now support same-sex marriage. a lot can happen in 13 years. a state can turn itself inside out in 13 years. when the california supreme court struck down proposition 22 as inconsistent with the state constitution, opponents of gay marriage got crafty and proposed another initiative -- proposition 8, which went so far as to amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. california voters approved the measure, 52% to 48% -- and in doing so, betrayed their own liberal reputation. share your reaction to the arguments think of the irony. on the very same day that a majority of voters in this dark blue state voted for the nation's first african-american president, a majority also approved a ballot initiative that winked at bigotry. worse, supporters of the measure included a majority of hispanic and african-american voters. they're no stranger to discrimination, and so they should know better. maybe many of these voters of color got swept up in the same wave of fear and ignorance that swept across the rest of the state's population. i live in california, and so i saw it all play out. it wasn't pretty. for instance, there were, in the final days of the campaign, a despicable series of ""yes on 8"" radio and television ads that took full advantage of bigotry's old buddy -- fear. one of the main messages behind these ads was that, if same-sex marriage were legal, it would somehow creep its way into the public schools through the curriculum. opinion: the real 'modern family' in america i remember one television ad that showed a little girl who hurried home from school and excitedly told her mother that she was reading a book about a prince who didn't marry a princess because he settled on marrying another prince. and so, she said with a big smile, when she grew up, she could marry a princess. the mother reacted with a panicked look. the spot did not make clear that california parents have the right to be notified if sexually explicit material is being taught and to pull their children out of class if they choose. those are the facts. but, as we have learned time and again, fear doesn't listen to facts. but the good news is that fear usually loses its strength over time. and that is what happened here. and it happened here, across the board. in the new field poll for california, 64% of african-americans and asian-americans and 56% of hispanics now support same-sex marriage. no one can say definitively why the numbers have shifted in california. but the change of heart does seem to mirror a national trend where -- as more americans discover or acknowledge that they have gays and lesbians among their friends and family -- their attitude toward same-sex marriage seems to be softening. a new cnn/orc international survey found evidence of something that analysts are calling the ""rob portman effect,"" in reference to the republican senator from ohio who changed his position on same-sex marriage after learning his son is gay. in the poll, 57% of americans now say that they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian. that's a 12-point gain since 2007. meanwhile, over that same time period, the number of americans who support same-sex marriage has gone up by almost exactly the same percentage. opinion: our journey with the clintons on gay rights this is either one heck of a coincidence or evidence that people come to support same-sex marriage as the issue begins to hit closer to home and they become aware that someone they care about is gay or lesbian. whatever is causing the shift, in california and throughout the united states, let's be thankful for it. the supreme court will be taking a close look at california's proposition 8, and it is expected to hand down its ruling in june. speaking of this issue being close to home for many of us, among those attending the arguments will be chief justice john roberts' lesbian cousin who lives in california. but, frankly, whatever the high court decides isn't all that important anymore. because, closer to home, many californians have already admitted their mistake. and soon, they'll be looking for a way to correct it. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of ruben navarrette jr.",ruben navarrette: california voted in 2008 to ban same-sex marriage

"-- it all sounds eerily familiar. a new iphone. massive sales. then, an apparent glitch that, while it doesn't affect everyone, is prevalent enough to irk customers and catch the eyes of tech journalists everywhere. poor battery life on the iphone 4s, released on october 14 to great fanfare and record sales, has been the new model's achilles' heel in the minds of many users. while complaints about the perceived problem haven't reached the fevered pitch that last year's iphone 4 release saw about its so-called ""death grip"" problem, they don't seem to be going away. there were, of course, the expected number of early-adopter quibbles with the phone: from troubles with new carrier sprint, to a sometimes slow-moving camera, to limits on the voice-activated siri ""personal assistant"" outside the united states. but as most of those gripes either got sorted or users got used to the limitations, complaints about the phone's battery life have persisted. a post on the apple support forums, begun on october 15 to discuss battery problems, was still active tuesday -- two weeks and 185 pages worth of comments later. ""i purchased what i thought was a top-of-the-line product only to be terribly disappointed,"" one user wrote tuesday. ""this is my first iphone and may well be my last."" battery life was a frequent complaint about the iphone 3gs, but concerns about the phone's short battery life seemed to have been addressed on the next-generation iphone 4. according to apple's official specs, the iphone 4s should have enough juice in the battery for up to eight hours of talk time, six hours of internet surfing, 10 hours of video viewing and 200 hours on standby. (all activities on a 3g connection -- 2g and wireless have different figures). all of those numbers are within an hour or so of the iphone 4, except for one. the older phone's specifications promise 300 hours of standby power: a full 50% more than the 4s. users complaining on the apple forum and elsewhere say that their phones aren't lasting anywhere near even that reduced length of time. various independent tests of the new phone have suggested that some phones have problems with poor battery life, while others don't. the general consensus among tech-inclined owners is that the problem may not lie with the battery itself, but with the way the phone utilizes apple's latest mobile operating system, ios 5. specifically, the theory goes, its location-based services are a power drain. if the phone is constantly trying to pinpoint where it is, it will suck power even when the user isn't actively doing something with the phone. (for a comparison, think about how quickly your battery drains when you forget to turn off wi-fi searches while you're driving.) the new phone also has a more powerful processor -- the same one that's in the ipad 2. that could cut battery life, even though apple ceo tim cook specifically said that it wouldn't during the iphone 4s unveiling event last month. apparently, reading from the well-worn apple playbook, the company has not commented publicly about the battery complaints. messages and e-mails to apple seeking comment on these complaints were not returned. it's unclear whether the company acknowledges there's a battery problem (although there have been reports that apple is contacting iphone 4s users to try to get to the bottom of it). and while it's too early for direct comparisons, the extended silence looks remarkably like the public-relations two-step that was apple's handling of the iphone 4's antenna issues. (as you may recall, consumer reports and others said the iphone 4 had antenna problems that caused it to drop calls. people dubbed the situation ""antennagate."") first, the company refused to publicly acknowledge the issue. then, there was a software patch apparently aimed at fixing it (although apple never explicitly said so). there would eventually be a news conference in which then-ceo steve jobs spent most of the time denying there was any real problem, then announcing that the company would give away free bumpers -- minimalist iphone cases -- to prevent dropped calls. but before that, there were the private e-mails and public statements saying, in essence, that users were holding their phones wrong. then, weeks after the free-bumper news conference, jobs and others doubled back, saying that there was never really much of a problem and discontinuing the freebie program. as apple's silence persists (the company has said in the past that it spends time researching potential problems before addressing them publicly), users and observers are complaining and speculating in the vacuum. and that's not always pretty.

"-- it's not news that looks matter. depending on how attractive people think we are, we may have at times found ourselves dateless or overwhelmed with unwanted attention. studies have indeed shown that people attribute more intelligence and competence to taller, well-turned-out or otherwise good-looking people. however, a new briefing paper by the council on contemporary families tell us life's uneven distribution of beauty counts in an even more poignant place than we may have considered: in school evaluations of our children by teachers and peers. in a recently releasted briefing report, ""in school, good looks help and good looks hurt (but they mostly help)."" sociologists rachel gordon and robert crosnoe show that in high school, some students -- say, a prom queen and king -- will be rated higher in intelligence, personality and potential for success just because they are considered good-looking. more than that, they will actually get higher grades and be more likely to graduate from college. in fact, the authors, whose the larger study -- published in book form by wiley -- say that ""the difference in gpa and college graduation rates between youth rated by others as attractive, versus average in looks, is similar to the differences in academic achievement between youth raised in two-parent versus single-parent families."" if the idea that kids get better grades based on ""getting by on looks"" frosts you, wait. this will make you nuts: based on their findings, gordon and crosnoe believe that the effects of beauty (or lack thereof) may last far beyond high school graduation. they say there is a cumulative boost (or loss) of self-esteem about one's own appearance that carries over from high school into college and perhaps over a lifetime. and even though the authors say that beauty has its pitfalls (good-looking men and women, for example, dated more and drank more and some of this had a negative impact on their grades and college success), their conclusion is that, overall, this period of ""lookism"" in high school is important enough to merit the same kind of consciousness-raising discussion given to unfair racial or class stereotypes. if looks translate into higher praise, better grades and even more credit for being warm and sensitive, as the authors found in their research, this is a real boon for the people with the lucky dna. each advantage a student has is likely to make that young man or woman feel more self-confident -- and self-confidence is an extraordinary tool to use in adult life. the other side of the coin is what's concerning: there is, as many parents know, the depression and sense of worthlessness a young adult may feel when he or she is not deemed good-looking in high school. it is frightening to think this may lead to a lifetime of feeling awkward, unlovable and inferior. we have all become more sensitive and activist about issues of adolescence we used to ignore. we now know how dangerous bullying is, how destructive depression can be and how important it is to reframe our view of people who have physical or mental disabilities. while we can't mandate that people change their opinion about who is or is not good-looking, we could ask our kids' teachers to be aware of their own tendency to give a higher grade or greater approval to a good-looking kid than to one that is not. we could all bring attention to slang that kids use to assess or denigrate another person's looks. does this sound too pc? maybe. but a little sensitivity here wouldn't be a bad thing. terms such as ""tubby"" or ""skinny"" or ""lame"" or other insult equivalents you may have heard don't need to be leveled at anyone. young people are acutely aware when they are not the favored ones, and they know that popularity and good looks are usually paired. moreover, an ambitious student who is attractive might prefer to be complimented on what he or she said or did rather than for appearance. it does them no favor to allow them to think that their looks are their primary and best attribute; it could cause them to be insecure about other aspects of their personality or behavior. talking openly about this could make it clearer to the people in our children's day-to-day world that their casual remarks can have long-term effects. it can also take some of the sting out of not being in the running for prom king or queen. and here i would suggest that such beauty and popularity contests are a dicey idea for schools in the first place. they have an impact on the impressions and behavior of everyone in the school, even, potentially, teachers. we spend time and energy to make sure our kids are treated fairly in life. let's help ensure they are not discriminated against -- or given a free ride -- just because of the way they look. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of pepper schwartz.",pepper schwartz: study finds edge given attractive people can start in school with teachers

"-- south sudan's president has written to more than 75 government officials and eight foreign governments in an attempt to recover $4 billion lost to corruption. ""if funds are returned, the government of the republic of south sudan will grant amnesty and keep your name confidential,"" president salva kiir said in the letter, which was dated may 3 and sent to former and current ""senior"" officials. kiir said the government has set up a special bank account in kenya where officials and ""corrupt individuals with close ties to government officials"" can deposit public funds. those who refuse to return all or part of the stolen cash will be held accountable, he said. ""most of these funds have been taken out of the country and deposited in foreign accounts,"" the letter said. kiir said he received ""some positive responses"" to letters he sent to eight heads of states, including the united states as well as countries in africa, the middle east and europe. the appeal comes as south sudan's government struggles to make up for losing 98 percent of its revenue when it halted oil production amid a dispute over transportation and processing fees with sudan. south sudan acquired three quarters if the formerly united country's oil reserves when in became independent last july. but the countries have been unable to agree on how much the landlocked south should pay to use infrastructure that remains in sudan. south sudan shut down production in late january after accusing sudan of stealing $815 million worth of its oil. sudan said it confiscated the crude to make up for unpaid fees. the shutdown has sent the economies of both countries reeling, but south sudan has been hit particularly hard by the loss of income from virtually its only export. the black market value of the south sudanese pound fell from about 3.5 to the dollar in january to about 5 currently. inflation has jumped almost 80 percent from may 2011 to may 2012, according to the national bureau of statistics. in world bank documents leaked to media last month, the washington-based lender warned of ""state collapse"" if the country runs out of foreign exchange reserves, which it said could be depleted by july -- one year after south sudan became the world's newest nation, following a two-decade civil war.

"-- western powers on thursday were debating using military power against syria's government to counter a chemical weapons attack in damascus' suburbs last week. on wednesday, u.s. president barack obama said there's no doubt that syria launched chemical weapons attacks against its own people. syrian president bashar al-assad's regime has blamed the august 21 attack on rebels. most recent: -- the united states may have to take unilateral action against syria after british lawmakers voted down a proposal for military action, a senior u.s. official said. -- british prime minister david cameron was dealt a blow thursday in his push for a strong response, including possible military action, against syria after the house of commons rejected the measure. -- the vote, 285-to-272, came just minutes after members of parliament voted down a labour party motion calling for additional time for u.n. weapons inspectors to gather evidence over whether al-assad's forces used chemical weapons in suburban damascus. -- a closed-door meeting of the u.n. security council ended with no agreement on a resolution to address the crisis in syria, a western diplomat told cnn's nick paton walsh on condition of anonymity. ""it was clear there was no meeting of minds, and no agreement on the text. it is clear that our approaches are very different and we are taking stock (of the next steps),"" the diplomat said. -- members of the security council expect u.n. weapons inspectors to brief secretary-general ban ki-moon shortly after they depart syria on saturday. ban, in turn, will swiftly brief the security council on the findings, the diplomat said. previously reported: -- cameron opened the emergency session of the house of commons on syria thursday by saying the debate is about ""how to respond to one of most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century"" -- not about regime change or invasion. -- cameron told the house of commons that the uk government would not act without first hearing from u.n. weapons inspectors, giving the united nations a chance to weigh in and parliament to have a vote. -- but ultimately, failing to act would give al-assad a signal that he could use such weapons ""with impunity, cameron said. -- the british government on thursday published a summary of its intelligence assessment on syria's alleged chemical weapons use, arguing that at least 350 people died in an attack in the damascus area on august 21, and that there is no plausible culprit other than the syrian government. it is ""highly likely"" that the syrian government was behind the attack, the report said. -- the british government also published its legal reasoning for a strike on syria thursday, saying that it would be justified on humanitarian grounds. -- ""the use of chemical weapons by the syrian regime is a serious crime of international concern, as a breach of the customary international law prohibition on use of chemical weapons, and amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity,"" the uk government's statement read. ""however, the legal basis for military action would be humanitarian intervention; the aim is to relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring or disrupting the further use of chemical weapons."" -- british members of parliament received an open letter from the syrian government thursday, urging them not to take any military action against syria, the press office for house of commons speaker john bercow said. -- the syrian letter to british lawmakers compares the current situation to the march to war against iraq a decade ago, and riffing on shakespeare, saying: ""if you bomb us, shall we not bleed?"" it also says an attack on syria would be illegal, and ""would automatically strengthen our common enemy, al qaeda and its affiliates."" chemical weapons in syria: how did we get here? -- al-assad vowed thursday to defend against any western military attack. ""the threats of launching an aggression against syria will increase its commitments,"" and ""syria will defend itself against any aggression,"" he said, according to syrian state tv. -- u.n. inspectors entered the eastern part of the ghouta region outside damascus on thursday, syrian activists said. the ghouta area was hit by the august 21 attack, activists say. -- al-assad's claim that rebels were behind the august 21 chemical attack is impossible, obama said on ""pbs newshour"" wednesday. ""we do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets, that the opposition could have carried out these attacks,"" obama said. ""we have concluded that the syrian government in fact carried these out. and if that's so, then there need to be international consequences."" -- former u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld, who along with president george w. bush helped send the u.s. military into action in iraq and afghanistan, told the fox business network on wednesday that the white house has yet to justify potential strikes in syria.","new: the united states may have to take unilateral action against syria, says an official"
"-- last week, in her opinion piece titled ""gop's slick black history ads fall short, miss the point,"" andra gillespie praised the republican national committee's recent black history month ads as a positive development, but she criticized us because those ads ""were not enough."" she's right. they're not enough, and we never suggested they were. in fact, the ads, titled ""honoring our past, building the future,"" are just part of our black history month tribute, which in turn is just part of our year-round, nonstop engagement efforts with black voters and communities across the country. following the release of the rnc's growth and opportunity project report last spring, the rnc, under chairman reince priebus' leadership, set out to do things differently in the way it engages with minority voters. the need was especially urgent in my community, the black community. it's there, in the black community, where we have the most ground to make up. in less than a year, the rnc has made strides to restart the conversation and build a presence in black communities across the country. as priebus noted at our second annual black republican trailblazer awards, we've hired black engagement state directors ""from michigan to louisiana, virginia to colorado and in between."" the rnc is hiring people who are from the community to work in the community, so they can get to know people and build relationships. these efforts are critical because people, regardless of background, don't always care what you know until they know that you care. growing the party and recruiting the next generation of black republicans require that we build relationships in places we haven't always been. now, i'll be the first to admit that even that is not enough. but it's a big start in a short period of time and a major step in the right direction. the rnc recognizes that no matter how significant our efforts, we can't do it alone, but we do want to set an example for our fellow republicans. in november, priebus traveled to detroit and hosted a round-table discussion with black business and community leaders at which he shared the party's vision for reviving our urban centers. the response was phenomenal. many republicans have stepped up to take similar actions, including house majority leader eric cantor and budget committee chairman paul ryan and sens. rand paul, rob portman and marco rubio. they've shown they're serious about growing the party and addressing voters' concerns through policy proposals, listening sessions and visits to communities across the county. we're happy to see that these republicans realize the importance of engagement efforts not only for the sake of our party but for the future of our country. unfortunately, when our efforts get discussed, it seems like they are always viewed only through the lens of political tactics. but the very reason that republicans seek to hold office is because we know that our principles, if properly applied, will improve lives by empowering people and communities. this includes offering parents a choice as to where their children go to school and fighting for adults who need jobs now. so while i appreciate andra bringing attention to our efforts, i hope she'll take the time to consider the breadth and depth of our engagement efforts in the black community. i hope she wasn't ignoring them for the sake of diminishing our work to score political points. regardless, the hard work continues, because no matter what, it's never enough. as long as there are voters who we haven't heard from or that haven't heard from us, there's work to do. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of orlando watson.",orlando watson says republicans stepping up outreach to the black community

"-- there is a predictable pattern that ensues following any tragic news in nigeria. there is at first a collective sense of shock and grief. there follows official visits to the scene of the tragedy. families are condoled and money is doled out in compensation. a period of mourning is inevitably announced. in a country where nothing happens quickly, committees and investigative panels will then be set up with remarkable alacrity. months will pass. and then nothing. the result is always the same. rhetoric, followed by vacuous proclamations but ultimately, inaction. the banal sequence has already begun playing out with news of sunday's fatal air crash in lagos which claimed over 150 lives. this time, however, nigerians are demanding answers. accidents do happen of course but the memories of january's mass protests are fresh and there lingers a suspicion of government negligence. it is far too early to determine the outcome of the crash but early indications are that this was an entirely avoidable disaster. see also: nigerians no longer 'suffering and smiling' the investigation must begin with dana air, operators of the ill fated boeing md-83. the irony is that the indian-owned airline has quite a decent track record since they began operations in nigeria four years ago. with a modest number of four aircraft in its fleet, the airline had grown at a reasonable pace and had just taken delivery of another boeing md-83 in may. a strong focus on domestic services and competitive fares had seen dana air become the airline of choice for many regular fliers. there were signs, however, in the last six months that standards had begun to slip. first came the irregular take-off times. dana flights, once paragons of punctuality, started taking off late or sometimes not at all. the delays were quite often without reason. on 15 may this year, i waited with other passengers for over six hours to board as engineers addressed a mechanical problem on one of its planes. on a separate occasion, we were to board the last dana flight out of lagos to abuja. the flight was canceled and no explanation given. there was no offer of compensation either. dana air has also faced accusations of penny-pinching. even before sunday's crash, there had been suggestions that dana's four aircraft were being overworked. see also: ireport images from lagos on sunday alone, the aircraft with registration number 5n-ram was already on its fourth trip of the day and scheduled to make another one. in may, the same aircraft had to make two unscheduled air returns following reports of engine failure, according to a dana air station manager in lagos. whatever the outcome of the investigation, the omens are not good for dana air. no nigerian airline has ever fully recovered from an air disaster. eas airlines, bellview, sosoliso and adc air were all nigerian airlines with decent sized fleets and considerable goodwill just ten years ago. their names all became obsolete pretty quickly following a spate of crashes between 2002 and 2006. the government has taken the step of withdrawing their operational license and ground dana aircraft whilst an inquiry takes place. even in the event of continued operations, there would have been a likely slump in passenger bookings which will harm the airline. the investigation must go beyond dana and extend to the nigerian civil aviation authority (ncaa). the main regulator of the country's airline industry will need to face some tough questions as well. did they do enough to minimize the chance of such a crash? the dana air was 22 years old, which is not exactly ancient in aviation terms but given that nigerian law prohibits aircraft over the age of 20 from operating, who fell asleep at the switch? besides at that age, any aircraft would require maintenance checks to be as regular as they are vigorous. separate eyewitness accounts of leaking hydraulics on the md-83 do not suggest that this was the case. this time around the nigerian public is in no mood for obfuscation or cover-ups. the last major air incident in nigeria was in october 2006 when an adc airlines flight crashed near abuja and killed 96 on board. the outcome of the subsequent investigation was never revealed but now there is a growing demand that such information is shared with the public. following that crash, the government grounded all commercial aircraft and revoked the licenses of many. air worthiness became a paramount issue and as a result the slack operators were forced to tighten up. those that could not shape up exited the scene. on that occasion it took over 500 deaths in five years to shake the government into action. if laxity has started to creep back into nigeria's aviation sector, one hopes that it will not take a similar rash of incidents to ensure that safety standards are being consistently met. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of terfa tilley-gyado.",gyado says there were signs that dana air standards had slipped in the last six months
"washington (cnn)they're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police, have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority. a new intelligence assessment, circulated by the department of homeland security this month and reviewed by cnn, focuses on the domestic terror threat from right-wing sovereign citizen extremists and comes as the obama administration holds a white house conference to focus efforts to fight violent extremism. some federal and local law enforcement groups view the domestic terror threat from sovereign citizen groups as equal to -- and in some cases greater than -- the threat from foreign islamic terror groups, such as isis, that garner more public attention.â€‹ the homeland security report, produced in coordination with the fbi, counts 24 violent sovereign citizen-related attacks across the u.s. since 2010. isis burned up to 40 people alive in iraq, official says the government says these are extremists who believe that they can ignore laws and that their individual rights are under attack in routine daily instances such as a traffic stop or being required to obey a court order. they've lashed out against authority in incidents such as one in 2012, in which a father and son were accused of engaging in a shootout with police in louisiana, in a confrontation that began with an officer pulling them over for a traffic violation. two officers were killed and several others wounded in the confrontation. the men were sovereign citizen extremists who claimed police had no authority over them. among the findings from the homeland security intelligence assessment: ""(sovereign citizen) violence during 2015 will occur most frequently during routine law enforcement encounters at a suspect's home, during enforcement stops and at government offices."" the report adds that ""law enforcement officers will remain the primary target of (sovereign citizen) violence over the next year due to their role in physically enforcing laws and regulations."" the white house has fended off criticism in recent days for its reluctance to say the words ""islamist extremism,"" even as the conference this week almost entirely focused on helping imams and community groups to counteract the lure of groups like isis. absent from the white house conference is any focus on the domestic terror threat posed by sovereign citizens, militias and other anti-government terrorists that have carried out multiple attacks in recent years. an administration official says the white house is focused on the threat from all terrorists, including from sovereign citizen and other domestic groups. ""i don't think it's fair to say the (white house) conference didn't address this at all,"" the official said, adding that president barack obama addressed the need to combat ""violent ideologies"" of all types. an official at the justice department, which is leading the administration's counter-radicalization effort, says many of the tactics aimed at thwarting radical islamic recruitment of young people can also be used to fight anti-government extremist groups. while groups like isis and al qaeda garner the most attention, for many local cops, the danger is closer to home. a survey last year of state and local law enforcement officers listed sovereign citizen terrorists, ahead of foreign islamists, and domestic militia groups as the top domestic terror threat. the survey was part of a study produced by the university of maryland's national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism. in 2013, a man who held anti-government views carried out a shooting attack on three transportation security administration employees at los angeles international airport, killing one tsa officer. last year, a couple killed two police officers and a bystander at a las vegas walmart store. mark potok, senior fellow at the southern poverty law center, said that by some estimates, there are as many as 300,000 people involved in some way with sovereign citizen extremism. perhaps 100,000 people form a core of the movement, he said. the federal government's focus on the domestic groups waxes and wanes, potok said, in part because the threat from foreign groups like al qaeda and its affiliates. potok says sovereign citizen groups have attracted support because of poor economic conditions. some groups travel the country pitching their ideology as a way to help homeowners escape foreclosure or get out of debt, by simply ignoring the courts and bankruptcy law. the homeland security report's focus on right-wing terrorists is a subject that garnered political controversy for the obama administration in the past. in 2009, a homeland security report on possible recruitment of military veterans by right-wing militia groups prompted an outcry from veterans groups. the report was produced by staff members during the bush administration but wasn't published until then homeland security janet napolitano had taken office. napolitano criticized her own agency for the report.",intelligence assessment focuses on domestic terror threat from right-wing sovereign citizen extremists

"-- top democrats are prepared to short-circuit the traditional legislative process and exclude their republican counterparts during final congressional health care deliberations, senior democratic sources have told cnn. democrats are trying to prevent the republicans from using senate rules to slow the push for final passage of a comprehensive reform bill, the sources added. house speaker nancy pelosi is set to discuss the politically contentious health care issue when she huddles in her office with other house democratic leaders tuesday afternoon. the house democratic leadership is also likely to meet with president obama, and plans to hold a conference call with their entire caucus. the full house of representatives is not scheduled to return from vacation until january 12; the senate meets january 19. pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid, however, have already discussed the issue over the phone, aides said. congressional leaders are working to merge an $871 billion senate bill and $1 trillion house bill that differ on several critical details. democratic leaders hope to get a bill to obama's desk by early february, near the time of the president's state of the union address, several democratic sources have said. pelosi admitted last month, however, that this deadline could slip. should the measure that emerges from house-senate negotiations become law, it would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of medicare and medicaid more than four decades ago. formal house-senate negotiations, under the ordinary legislative process, would likely have started shortly after both houses of congress reconvene. democratic concerns over the gop's ability to slow the process, however, may result in the traditional process being replaced with informal, high-level talks, sources stated. in order to hold a formal conference, conferees -- members of the house and senate -- must be formally appointed by both bodies, with resolutions passed by both the senate and the house. one democratic leadership aide said getting those resolutions passed in the senate could delay and even derail democratic efforts, because republicans would be allowed to offer amendments and hold lengthy debates on the resolutions to appoint conferees. many observers believe the more liberal house measure will be largely forced to conform to the senate bill. the traditionally fractious 60-member senate democratic caucus struggled to unify behind a single measure, and needs to remain united in order to overcome solid republican opposition. the different approach to financing in the house and senate bills is one of the many differences that must now be reconciled. the house measure is paid for through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy americans and new medicare spending reductions. individuals with annual incomes over $500,000 -- as well as families earning more than $1 million -- would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge. the senate bill also cuts medicare by roughly $500 billion. but instead of an income tax surcharge on the wealthy, it would impose a 40-percent tax on insurance companies that provide what are called ""cadillac"" health plans valued at more than $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families. proponents of the tax on high-end plans argue it's one of the most effective ways to curb medical inflation. however, house democrats oppose taxing such policies because it would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous health benefits. back in december, obama predicted the final bill will probably end up with a variation of both the income tax surcharge and the tax on high-end plans. ""cadillac plans ... don't make people healthier, but just take more money out of their pockets,"" he argued in an interview with national public radio. the senate bill also would hike medicare payroll taxes on families making over $250,000; the house bill does not. another key sticking point is the dispute over a public option. the house plan includes a public option; the more conservative senate package would instead create nonprofit private plans overseen by the federal government. given the reality of the 60-vote threshold in the senate, however, there hasn't been much serious discussion among house leaders about pushing hard to keep the public option. one of the top house liberal leaders -- south carolina rep. james clyburn -- recently said he could vote for a bill without the government insurance plan. ""we want a public option to do basically three things: create more choice for insurers, create more competition for insurance companies, and to contain costs,"" clyburn said on the cbs program ""face the nation. ""so if we can come up with a process by which these three things can be done, then i'm all for it. whether or not we label it a public option or not is of no consequence."" maryland rep. chris van hollen, chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee, said at the end of december on the show ""fox news sunday"" that the public option is ""not dead, but we also recognize that the senate was able to just muster the 60 votes."" individuals under both plans would be required to purchase coverage, but the house bill includes more stringent penalties for most of those who fail to comply. the house bill would impose a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual's income. the senate plan would require individuals to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $750 or 2 percent of his or her income, whichever is greater. both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer americans. employers face a much stricter mandate under the house legislation, which would require companies with a payroll of more than $500,000 to provide insurance or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll. the senate bill would require companies with more than 50 employees to pay a fee of up to $750 per worker if any of its employees rely on government subsidies to purchase coverage. abortion also has been a sticking point for both chambers. a compromise with catholic and other conservatives in the house led to the adoption of an amendment banning most abortion coverage from the public option. it also would prohibit abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies. senate provisions, made more conservative than initially drafted in order to satisfy nebraska sen. ben nelson, would allow states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the exchanges. individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds. nelson recently warned on cnn's ""state of the union"" that he would withdraw his support if the final bill gets changed too much from the senate version. despite their differences, however, the house and senate have already reached agreement on a broad range of topics. both chambers have agreed to subsidize insurance for a family of four making up to roughly $88,000 annually, or 400 percent of the federal poverty level. they also have agreed to create health insurance exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses, the self-employed and the unemployed to pool resources and purchase less-expensive coverage. both the house plan and the senate bill would eventually limit total out-of-pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. insurers would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history. however, both bills allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for older customers. medicaid would be significantly expanded under both proposals. the house bill would extend coverage to individuals earning up to 150 percent of the poverty level, or roughly $33,000 for a family of four. the senate plan ensures coverage to those earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level, or just over $29,000 for a family of four. both the house and senate bills would permit the creation of nonprofit private insurance cooperatives to increase competition. cnn's dana bash, lisa desjardins, alan silverleib, and deirdre walsh contributed to this report.",democratic sources say republicans could use senate rules to slow final passage
"-- in a change of policy, u.s. marines are now allowed to wear bracelets in memory of fallen comrades. the metal or rubber bracelets can honor ""prisoners of war, missing in action, killed in action, and those who died of wounds or injuries sustained in a combat theater,"" the marine corps said in a statement tuesday. some marines had been wearing the bracelets -- which list names of those killed in afghanistan, iraq or other zones -- despite their not being permitted by regulations. there had been questions about enforcement of the policy. the decision came out of a symposium last week at which the issue was discussed by the marine commandant, gen. james f. amos, and his senior officers, the statement said. ""we are acknowledging the close personal nature of our 10 years at war and the strong bonds of fidelity that marines have for one another, especially for those fellow marines who we have lost,"" amos said in the release. amos on monday met marines who had returned to the marine corps air ground combat center at twentynine palms, california, from afghanistan. he noticed bracelets and received ""positive feedback"" on the wearing of the them, said maj. stewart t. upton, a marine spokesman. about 360 members of the 3rd battalion, 4th marines, were welcomed home. they had five comrades killed during their seven-month deployment in helmand province, said center spokesman capt. nicholas mannweiler. ""they are typically providing security,"" said mannweiler. ""they made a lot of improvements."" the captain said the policy decision on the bracelets signified ""we get why you're wearing it and it's blessed."" guidance on ""standardization and uniformity"" will be distributed to marines by the end of next week, the corps said. marines had been permitted to wear the long-familiar pow/mia bracelets since 1972, during the vietnam war, upton said.",corps permits marines to wear bands in honor of absent comrades

"-- depending on who is talking, the tea party movement is either an extremist force dividing republicans or a group of disgruntled taxpayers setting the government on a proper course. the conservative political force has shaken up this year's congressional elections, backing candidates who defeated republican incumbents and other mainstream gop candidates in primaries across the country. sal russo, chief strategist for the tea party express -- the most organized and visible of the movement's factions -- told the cbs program ""face the nation"" that his group is a political action committee comprising members limited to donations of up to $5,000 with no corporate contributions allowed. ""we're the purest form of democracy, i think, in the tea party movement, in the sense that when we want to do something, we don't have any money to start with, we have to send an e-mail out to our people and say, 'hey, we think sharron angle is going to be a great candidate in nevada, and do you want to get behind her?' "" russo said sunday. the end result, he said, would be the election of candidates ""willing to stand up for more responsible fiscal policy in washington."" ""we've turned the political system on its head,"" russo said. ""and what's done that is that millions of americans, who, many of them, had been sitting out the political process, have gotten involved in the campaigns."" however, illinois sen. dick durbin, the second-ranking democrat in the chamber, told cnn's ""state of the union"" program that candidates such as angle showed the negative impact of the tea party movement on the political right. republican primary victories by tea party-backed nominees over mainstream contenders such as alaska sen. lisa murkowski and nine-term delaware rep. mike castle end up giving democratic contenders a chance to win previously out-of-reach races in november, he said. ""when the tea party becomes the gatekeeper of a republican primary, we end up with contests we never dreamed of,"" durbin said. ""who would have guessed that today we would be taking an honest look at alaska, delaware, and kentucky, where we clearly have races where the democrats can win?"" durbin also cited florida, where republican marco rubio's senate candidacy with tea party support caused gov. charlie crist to wage an independent campaign, throwing the race into what durbin called ""turmoil."" ""i think that shows the tea party position is too extreme for most voters, and i think we're going to do well in those states,"" durbin said. ""people have to ask themselves, is this what we really want in the united states senate?"" rubio, interviewed on the cbs program, said he and the tea party movement reflected the ""sentiment in mainstream america that washington is broken."" ""we don't want to change america,"" he said in reference to president barack obama's 2008 campaign theme and agenda. ""we want to fix things that are wrong in america."" he advocated bedrock conservative positions, including a balanced budget amendment to the u.s. constitution, banning congressional earmarks and imposing term limits on congress members. however, his stance was more moderate on an issue important to the crucial senior citizen population in florida -- reforming social security to ensure its future solvency. rubio said benefits for current retirees or those close to retirement should remain fixed, and the system must survive for the younger and future generations without bankrupting the country. ""we're going to have to accept there are going to be some changes,"" he said, mentioning a possible future increase in the retirement age for eligibility. also on the program, another tea party-backed nominee -- colorado republican senate candidate ken buck -- expressed similar conservative credentials. ""i see myself as part of a group of candidates who have been elected in this country because of frustration with what's happening in washington, d.c.,"" buck said. ""we're going there not to be part of the establishment, not to be part of what we consider the problem in washington, d.c., but to get there and to reduce spending, to promote ideas like a balanced-budget amendment and term limits and ideas that have been talked about for a while,"" he said. the tea party-backed candidates interviewed sunday made no mention of the ""pledge to america"" document released last week by house republicans as a proposal for how they would govern if in power. democrats criticized the economic-focused program that includes reduced spending, lower taxes and other bedrock gop positions as a rehash of failed past policies. in an editorial saturday, the new york times called the document ""a bid to co-opt the tea party by a republican leadership that wants to sound insurrectionist but is the same old washington elite."" ""not only are the players the same, the policies are the same,"" the editorial said. ""just more tax cuts for the rich and more deficit spending. we find it hard to believe that even the most disaffected voters will be taken in."" conservative rep. mike pence of indiana told the nbc program ""meet the press"" that the ""pledge to america"" represented a return to republican roots. ""republicans didn't just lose our majority in 2006, we lost our way,"" pence said. ""we walked away from the principles of fiscal discipline and reform that minted our governing majority back in 1980 and again in 1994. and the american people walked away from us."" conceding that the proposals in the document are ""not necessarily new,"" pence said it represented a commitment to ""important first steps in this congress to steer our national government back to"" basic principles and practices.",sunday talk shows offer varying views of tea party movement
"-- the u.s. navy seals' dramatic rescue of poul hagen thisted and jessica buchanan early wednesday ended the hostages' three-month ordeal in somalia. but why was it left to the united states to conduct this operation in a country thousands of miles away? the short answer is that the united states has the military and intelligence capabilities to conduct the rescue of a u.s. citizen in pressing need of medical attention. the longer answer is that somalia lacks the capacity to suppress piracy and other organized crime without international support. this is evidenced by the failed attempt of somali forces to rescue a danish family in march 2011, where, as has so often been the case, local authorities found themselves outgunned by the organized criminals. there are no somali agencies that can effectively fight piracy and other crimes in somalia, which has existed under a relatively impotent transitional federal government since the central government collapsed in 1991. most of somalia is a patchwork of quasi-autonomous regions, across which neither governance nor law enforcement is coordinated. while most nations recognize the transitional government in mogadishu as the legitimate government of somalia, its reach is extremely limited. local administrations are thus left to manage issues of organized crime with little resources or support. the result: citizens exist in a precarious truce with a well-armed and organized criminal element. it is in this context of lawlessness that the united states opted to take direct action to release these two hostages. but such heroic and high-profile moves, by the united states or any other nation equipped for them, are not a long-term solution to somalia's plague of organized crime, now spilling across borders. to break this cycle of crime, the international community must step up its commitment to investing in somali stability and addressing the symptoms of the nation's governance vacuum. a recent report by the center for american progress estimated that $9 billion in humanitarian and development aid went into somalia over the past 20 years. this is a stark contrast to the billions that piracy costs the world each year. a forthcoming one earth future report finds that $7 billion was spent on measures to address somali piracy alone in 2011. if the international community does not shift toward building sustainable somali law enforcement capabilities at sea and ashore, the only realistic options to resolve hostage situations will continue to be through military action or ransom payments. among the ways money used to combat piracy is spent: 1. international navies support operations to patrol somali waters and the western indian ocean. 2. nations fund suspect and prisoner transfer arrangements and ""outsourcing"" of prosecution within the region, as well as europe, north america and asia. (even more will be spent to incarcerate convicted pirates.) 3. the maritime industry spends billions on armed guards, extra insurance, ""ship hardening"" and re-routing. 4. shipping companies pay expensive ransoms, if other measures fail. somali criminal elements have proven themselves to be amazingly resilient and adaptable. and we can expect that this rescue may lead to an even greater escalation of violence and corresponding threats to innocent human life, including the estimated 190 hostages held (one of whom is a recently captured american writer) and the thousands of seafarers who continue to transit this dangerous area. indeed, the violence has been increasing as pirates confront private security teams and aggressive naval actions. they have changed their tactics to separate and conceal hostages and are re-investing ransom funds into criminal enterprises. gangs are also becoming more sophisticated. hostage takers now demonstrate a familiarity with international law that prohibits negotiation with international terrorist groups. groups labeled as terrorists simply sell their hostages to middlemen who can legally negotiate. yet there has been surprisingly little investment from the international maritime community in a sustainable solution, although for a brief time last fall it appeared there might be a ray of hope. when the radical islamist group, al-shabaab withdrew from mogadishu in early fall 2011, many saw this as an opportunity to reinvigorate efforts to stabilize somalia. in september, key regional leaders from somalia adopted a ""somali roadmap"" to improve security, the constitution, reconciliation and good governance. but with a fractured political system and roiling conflict between the country's regions, implementation has been slow. now the world's eyes are turning to a high-level conference to be convened by u.k. prime minister david cameron in london on february 23 aimed at tackling the root causes of the problems in somalia, including piracy. we can only hope that this conference will set the stage for a coordinated and forward-looking international effort that engages all the stakeholders in somalia and looks past the symptoms. follow cnn opinion on twitter. join the conversation on facebook. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jon huggins.",jon huggins says u.s. freed somali pirate hostages because it had resources to do it
"""so, how can we promote seoul as a safe destination in the foreign media in the midst of the current north korea situation?"" that was the question posed by a seoul government foreign public relations representative at a meeting on monday, even as pyongyang continued its militaristic rhetoric, announcing on the same day that north korea is pulling workers out of a joint north-south industrial zone. fearing both short and long term drops in tourism, the seoul government was seeking advice at a meeting it requested with north korea expert andrei lankov, a professor at seoul's kookmin university. ""it's a very important question, but the problem is that the foreign media believes north korea's threats when they should not,"" said lankov, who has been studying north korea for almost 30 years. throughout the meeting, which took place in lankov's office, the professor ignored his mobile phone and office land line, even as both rang incessantly. ""journalists,"" he said, shaking his head. lankov advised the seoul government to bombard the media with images showing how the day to day lives of south koreans have remained unaffected by north korean threats, and how its residents remain unconcerned by the hostile rhetoric. ""negative impact on south korean tourism and the south korean economy is exactly what north korea wants,"" said lankov, who is adamant in his belief that north korea won't attack the south. ""[north korean leader] kim jong un is living a wonderful life that is better than any conglomerate owner's life in south korea -- why would he want to cut that short?"" said the north korea expert. ""he is therefore the one person south korea can truly depend on to not go to war,"" lankov concluded. impact on south korea tourism it seems logical that tourism in seoul, and all of south korea, would suffer in the wake of the hostile rhetoric from the north korean government. seoul is located just 190 kilometers (118 miles) from pyongyang, well within range of hundreds if not thousands of north korean artillery and missile units. north korea: our global fear and fascination however, no country has yet issued alerts or warnings concerning travel to south korea. ""the embassy has not changed its security posture and we have not recommended that u.s. citizens who reside in, or plan to visit, the republic of korea (south korea) take special security precautions at this time,"" reads a statement posted on the u.s. embassy in seoul's website. there's no denying, however, that some travelers are altering their plans. ""we had two colleagues in new york who decided to push back their business trip to seoul because of the north korea crisis,"" said annie kim, a korean american risk manager at a multinational bank. kim, who arrived in seoul two weeks ago on business, told cnn she doesn't believe the threats pose a danger. her colleagues, however, are getting more nervous about the situation with each news report. ""they say they will come only after it all blows over,"" she said. record month despite concerns, tourism numbers in south korea are up. way up. last week, the korea tourism organization (kto) announced a record number of visitors for the month of march. for the first time in history, inbound international tourists numbered more than a million -- an 11.9% increase compared with the same month last year. numbers for april won't be available until may. ""we've had record numbers from every country except japan and germany,"" kto's kang sun-duk told cnn. according to kang, tourist numbers are impacted by geopolitics, but not necessarily those involving north korea. ""many of the chinese tourists who would have been visiting japan are now coming to south korea due to the island disputes between china and japan,"" said kang. china, japan swap barbs over disputed islands approximately 12,000 visitors per day are currently entering south korea on cruises from china, according to the kto. business as usual at dmz south korea's largest airline, korean air, and several major hotels in seoul, tell cnn there has been no noticeable dip in bookings. ""we have not seen any impact from the news from north korea thus far, but we'll have to see about any further impact,"" a korean air public relations representative told cnn. this past weekend at imjingak, an area within the demilitarized zone (dmz) popular with tourists, business appeared down only slightly. though parking lots were jammed with chinese tour groups and korean families on day trips, the dmz appeared to have fewer western visitors than usual. ""we've seen around a 20% decrease in business, but it's not too bad,"" said kim bong-nam, 57, who has been selling hot dogs at the dmz for 30 years. ""there was a similar drop in visitors when the yeonpyong island shelling happened,"" he said, referring to the 2010 incident when two civilians and two south korean marines died after a north korean attack. kto's dmz office said tours were operating normally. the kto was unable to provide specific dmz visitor data. ""we are not afraid at all!"" said a member of a group of tourists from hebei, china, when asked why they'd decided to visit the dmz in the midst of current reports. ""there will be only peace here."" according to professor lankov, there's a reason chinese tourists are unruffled by the threats from north korea. according to the north korea expert, chinese media isn't reporting on the situation in dire tones. he said chinese reporters haven't adopted the posture of their western counterparts, ""like cnn and bbc, as if war is going to break out."" ""the chinese government doesn't allow them to portray their fellow communist country in that light,"" said lankov.",seoul government seeks advice on promoting tourism
"-- a federal appeals court in washington thursday struck down the texas voter id law requiring photos for voters at the polls, calling it racially discriminatory. the decision is a major victory for the obama administration and its democratic allies, which had challenged the law. texas attorney general greg abbott promptly announced the state will appeal the ruling to the supreme court. republican gov. rick perry signed the voter id measure into law last year, but it had yet not gone into effect because the federal voting rights act requires changes in texas voting laws to be pre-cleared by the u.s. justice department. attorney general eric holder denied the pre-clearance of the measure in march, concluding that texas failed to show the law will not have ""the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race."" the three-judge panel agreed. although the law provides for approved voter registration certificates with no photo as acceptable for voting in certain circumstances, the court said the law imposes ""strict unforgiving burdens on the poor."" the court noted the requirements will fall heavily on african-americans and hispanics, who make up a disproportionate percentage of the poor in texas. the panel of judges for the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia also said it was ruling only on the texas law, and not issuing a statement about other state voting laws. it noted the justice department had approved a georgia voter id law in which the state promised to provide free photo id cards to citizens who request them. eric holder defends opposition to proposed texas voter id law holder praised the court's decision thursday. ""under the proposed law, many of those without the required voter identification would be forced to travel great distances to get one -- and some would have to pay for the documents they might need to do so,"" said a statement from the attorney general. holder also repeated his assertion that the law would discriminate against minorities. abbott, meanwhile, said texas will immediately take the case to the nation's highest court, where ""we are confident we will prevail."" he said the supreme court had already approved similar ballot integrity safeguards passed in georgia and indiana. the ruling comes as another three-judge panel in washington is hearing arguments this week on a similar law passed in south carolina. republican-dominated legislatures say such laws are designed to eliminate voter fraud. democrats claim there is no voter fraud issue, and that the laws are designed to reduce voting by poor minorities. ""chalk up another victory for fraud,"" said gov. perry, in a statement on his website.

"los angeles, california (cnn) -- turn up the music, crack the window -- falling gas prices have flipped on the road-trip ignition switch. the neptune pool at hearst castle is 104 feet long and 95 feet wide at the alcove. i decided to celebrate the unofficial return of reasonable driving vacations with a venture to the ultimate temple of excess -- hearst castle. from los angeles, my family and i retraced the journey of hollywood luminaries who headed north to hang out with publishing tycoon william randolph hearst. charlie chaplin, cary grant, clark gable, gregory peck, carol lombard and hearst's mistress marion davies all made the trek to what hearst called ""la cuesta encantada,"" or the enchanted hill. winston churchill and president calvin coolidge also rested here amid art and antiquities from around the world. hearst castle looks down over golden fields, the glistening pacific and the town of san simeon, california, home to less than 500 people. we took a tour bus from the visitors center to the mansion, a long gull's dive from the ocean, 1,610 feet above sea level. hearst hired san francisco architect julia morgan in 1919 and by 1947 the 165-room estate stretched over 127 acres. it's crystal clear hearst was a demanding mastermind of his kingdom on the hill, putting morgan through what must have been agonizing brain twisters. visitors see that when hearst wanted european choir chairs wedged into his assembly room, morgan made it work. when he wanted elaborate ceilings salvaged from europe, morgan expanded their reach to fit into the estate's rooms. a massive 95 x 104-foot outdoor swimming pool, made of concrete and vermont marble, is one of the central jewels of the property. our guide recounted hearst house rules. in an effort to control his guests' alcohol consumption, hearst banned them from bringing their own liquor. the hollywood types reportedly snuck it in anyway, like frat boys at a football game. guests stayed in opulent guest houses adorned with religious icons, art and other worldly treasures. hearst mandated unmarried guests sleep apart, while violating his own edict by sleeping with his beloved actress friend marion davies. though hearst remained married to millicent hearst, with whom he had five children, davies' ghost is everywhere at hearst castle. images of the actress, along with charlie chaplin and others stars, flicker about in a short film shown in the mansion's 50-seat movie theater. museum-worthy pieces fill the property, including intricate flemish tapestries in an east-facing sitting room called the morning room. owing to my belgian roots, i looked at the tapestries and cracked to my kids, ""no wonder my 83-year-old mother can still sew a tiny patch onto a girl scout vest."" the castle's grandeur was enough to hold the childrens' attention. we saw them as young as 4 years old, eyes popping while taking in ancient egyptian statues or towering christmas trees.

"the debate over japan's constitution took a grisly turn sunday, as a lone dissenter set fire to himself in an apparent protest over plans to ""reinterpret"" the document. police received emergency calls beginning around 1 p.m. (local time) on sunday that a man wearing a suit had climbed the frame of a pedestrian bridge near the busy shinjuku train station in central tokyo and was speaking through a megaphone. onlookers said he used the device to criticize government plans to change the japanese constitution. police officers smelled gasoline when they arrived, a police spokesman told cnn. next to the man, who has not been named, were two plastic bottles containing what they believed to be fuel. police and firefighters tried to persuade the man to come down off the bridge. as a rescue team with a ladder truck approached him around 2 p.m., police say the man set himself on fire, shocking onlookers who had gathered below. he was conscious when taken to hospital, where he continues to receive treatment. a police spokesperson told cnn that he will be charged with using flames in public without a permit, which is considered a minor offense. self-immolation is a highly unusual form of protest in japan. constitutional change the abe administration has imminent plans to ""reinterpret"" the postwar document to allow for a greater military role overseas. currently, japan's constitution, signed into effect following the second world war, allows for self-defense but does not authorize military action outside japan. the changes would allow the japanese self defense force to engage in collective defense, which includes deploying soldiers internationally to defend the interests of japanese allies. the government's proposal is expected to gain cabinet approval on july 1st after an agreement is finalized between japan's main ruling parties, despite polls that say a majority of japanese citizens oppose the measure. the timeframe is under scrutiny, with many wary that the changes are being pushed through too quickly. supporters of the proposal say that it creates another, strategically important, buttress against increasing chinese hegemony in the region. but opponents -- both domestically and abroad -- oppose the change to article 9 of the document, which states ""the japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes."" the proposed change to the wording has also worried japan's neighbors, who see the hawkish abe as largely unrepentant for what most asians view as war crimes committed by japanese troops during the second world war. the premier's visit to the controversial yasukuni shrine in december 2013 was criticized by some neighboring countries.",man sets himself on fire near busy tokyo train station in apparent protest
"-- a foul smell permeating london and parts of england over the past two days is due to farmers on the european continent spreading manure in their fields, forecasters and british farmers said saturday. experts say the inescapable farmland smell permeating london will stick around for a couple of days. the agricultural odor is inescapable in central london and smells vaguely of farmland or even garbage. forecasters said a stiff breeze from the east is carrying the smell across the north sea from belgium, the netherlands and even germany. they said the smell is likely to hang around through the weekend as the easterly wind continues. ""you can't say it's going to smell for two days, but the wind is coming in from the same direction,"" said chris almond, a forecaster with the met office, britain's weather service. ""it's not really until monday, tuesday that we'll see a change in the wind direction, with a more marked improvement in air quality."" he said the smell had probably been stagnating in those countries for a few days, resulting in a more pungent aroma once the winds brought it to england. the national farmers' union blamed the smell on the muck-spreading by dutch farmers, who it said are banned from the practice in the winter and are now spreading it ""en masse."" although the smell may be unusual, the phenomenon of european air spilling its contents over england is not, forecasters have said. ""we quite often get pollution in the form of haze coming over when we've got these winds from [an] easterly direction, particularly when the winds are coming off the near-continent,"" he said. almond said the smell is in much of central and eastern england, and has reached as far west as devon, on the southwestern tip of england, where his office is located. london newspapers reported the smell on their front pages friday afternoon, with one paper branding it ""le stink."" the farmers' union used the odor to make its case against a similar winter ban proposed on muck-spreading in britain. ""this is what happens when farmers are forced to empty their slurry store all in one go at the same time instead of being able to apply it little and often during the winter,"" spokesman anthony gibson said. ""while we are obviously very sorry for any unpleasantness caused to people living in the south east, we are grateful to the dutch farmers for laying on such a pungent demonstration of what could happen every spring here in the uk if the government presses ahead with its ill-conceived proposal to implement a blanket ban on winter slurry spreading across most or all of the country."" e-mail to a friend",agricultural odor is inescapable in central london
"-- qatar, as diplomats say, likes to ""punch above its weight."" this arid peninsula in the persian gulf is smaller than connecticut but played a leading role in helping libyan rebels oust moammar gadhafi and has been at the heart of arab league sanctions against syria. it's now facilitating talks on the afghan conflict by allowing the taliban to open a liaison office in its capital, doha. qatar is also home to the pan-arab news channel al jazeera, a thorn in the side of many arab regimes past and present. it is a major player in the energy industry, with vast reserves of natural gas, and -- perhaps in an effort to outflank dubai as the playground of the gulf -- is due to host the soccer world cup in 2022. it helps that the emirate is fabulously wealthy, with the highest per-capita gross domestic product in the world. it can fund ambitious initiatives -- to help fund the palestinian authority, for example, or provide cash and weapons to the libyan rebels. now it's exploiting long-held ties with the taliban to provide a platform between the group and the international community, and especially the united states. will taliban's qatar address change dynamics of afghan conflict? as far back as 2001, before the group was ousted in afghanistan, the qataris hosted taliban delegations. and in the past year, thanks to its hyperactive diplomacy under prime minister (and foreign minister) hamid bin jassim al-thani, the emirate has emerged as a regional power broker -- to the consternation of its larger neighbor, saudi arabia. qatar's growing dynamism within the arab league has been most evident amid the unrest in libya and syria. it was one of two arab states to play a role in enforcing the no-fly zone over libya. and according to journalists in western libya last spring, qatari advisers were working with libyan rebels in the nafusa mountains as well as supplying anti-tank missiles and other weaponry to rebel forces in the east. in november, qatar forged a package of sanctions against the regime of bashar al-assad that was adopted by the arab league, provoking an attack on its embassy in damascus and the withdrawal of the qatari ambassador. it lobbied other arab states hard, telling them that effective arab action was required to avoid ""foreign interference"" in syria. qatar was also ready to use the power of the purse with syria by canceling projects there. as part of intensive efforts to build a relationship with the united states, qatar has allowed u.s. forces to use the al-udeid air base for operations in iraq, afghanistan and somalia. it also hosts the forward headquarters of the u.s. central command. over the past 10 years, qatar has also offered to be the go-between in iran for successive u.s. administrations. according to a 2006 u.s. diplomatic cable, foreign minister al-thani told a u.s. official, with some pride: ""qatar talks to iran as an equal, and this is important."" the two countries are joined at the hip, as they share vast natural gas reserves under the gulf. and it is a principle of qatari diplomacy that it will cultivate groups that won't talk to each other -- hamas and iran as well as washington. qatar also offered to help the united states improve relations with sunni tribal leaders in iraq at the height of the insurgency there. the emir, hamad bin khalifa al-thani, and his family drive qatari policy and have proved themselves agile negotiators with a grasp of the intricacies of middle east politics. u.s. diplomatic cables describe qatari officials as well-prepared with a detailed understanding of the nuances of their complex neighborhood. the arab spring has worked in qatar's favor. one of the few states where no protests have occurred, it has taken advantage of saudi caution and upheavals in egypt and syria to carve out an assertive regional role. but qatar's activism generates plenty of resentment. the populism of al jazeera has infuriated arab regimes. the emir fends off complaints about al jazeera's reporting, telling cnn's wolf blitzer last year: ""of course it's not necessary i will agree with what al jazeera say. actually, jazeera caused for me a lot of problems."" similarly, the saudis are suspicious of qatar's open channel with iran. president ali abdullah saleh of yemen put an end to qatari efforts to mediate between his government and huthi rebels. and president hamid karzai recalled the afghan envoy in doha in december because he'd been kept in the dark about contacts with the taliban. but the al-thanis are not afraid to ruffle feathers. in the diplomatic world, as one gulf commentator observed, qatar is proof that size isn't everything.",qatar is allowing the taliban to open a liaison office in its capital

""she'd give them a job like that,"" he told the mourners. ""she loved her band. she would pick up anybody to work for,"" he added. in a lighter moment, the son recalled how high-spirited his mother was. ""she was feisty, very feisty,"" he said.

"(cnn) -- james von brunn, who was accused of killing a security guard at the u.s. holocaust memorial museum in june, died wednesday morning at a hospital in north carolina, his attorney said. ""he was just very sick,"" public defender a.j. kramer said. ""it is a sad end to a very sad occurrence."" von brunn, 89, a self-avowed white supremacist, was a known holocaust denier who created an anti-semitic web site called ""the holy western empire."" kramer said officials from the u.s. bureau of prisons transferred von brunn to an undisclosed hospital, apparently realizing his condition was worsening. before being moved, von brunn was undergoing mental competency tests at a prison facility in butner, north carolina. the cause of death wasn't immediately known. a federal grand jury indicted von brunn in july on murder charges in the death of stephen tyrone johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, the justice department said. von brunn, of annapolis, maryland, faced a seven-count indictment in the june 10 attack. four of the counts could have made him eligible for the death penalty. he also was charged with gun violations and hate crimes. officers at the museum returned fire and shot him, and he was hospitalized. in july, against his will, von brunn was ordered to undergo psychiatric testing. he ignored the advice of the judge and his defense attorney and addressed the court during a hearing to fight any delays. ""your constitution guarantees me a speedy and fair trial,"" he said from his wheelchair to u.s. district judge reginald walton. von brunn repeatedly claimed ""the diary of anne frank,"" a widely read book about a teenage girl's experiences under nazi rule, was a hoax. the museum shooting occurred on a day the museum was to stage a play based on anne frank and two days before what would have been her 80th birthday. investigators found a notebook in the suspect's car listing other locations in washington, a federal official told cnn. it was unclear what purpose the list served. von brunn is accused of entering the museum in the afternoon and shooting johns with a rifle, said chief cathy lanier of the district of columbia's metropolitan police department. two other security guards returned fire, according to lanier and a museum statement. both johns and von brunn were taken to george washington university hospital, said d.c. mayor adrian fenty. johns died at the hospital. johns, 40, was a resident of temple hills, maryland, according to a statement issued by wackenhut services inc., which has provided security services at the museum since 2002. cnn's paul courson contributed to this report.",he was accused of killing officer stephen tyrone johns at the holocaust memorial museum
"-- the religious leader behind plans to erect an islamic center and mosque a few blocks from new york's ground zero said wednesday night that america's national security depends on how it handles the controversy. ""if we move from that location, the story will be the radicals have taken over the discourse,"" imam feisal abdul rauf told cnn's soledad o'brien on ""larry king live."" ""the headlines in the muslim world will be that islam is under attack."" the imam, who repeatedly said his mission was to promote peace and build a bridge among faiths, said he was also speaking about ""radicals"" on both sides of the debate on the islamic center. ""our national security now hinges on how we negotiate this, how we speak about it."" ""the battlefront is between moderates of all sides... and the radicals on all sides,"" he said. moving the project to another location would strengthen islamist radicals' ability to recruit followers and will likely increase violence against americans, the imam said. rauf said that ""nothing is off the table"" when asked whether he would consider moving the site. ""we are consulting, talking to various people about how to do this so that we negotiate the best and safest option."" the imam told o'brien ""had i known [the controversy] would happen we certainly would never have done this."" asked if he meant he would not have picked the location, rauf said, ""we would not have done something that would create more divisiveness."" worry over what some observers have termed ""islamophobia"" has been heightened by a gainesville, florida, church's plan to burn copies of the quran on saturday, the ninth anniversary of the 2001 attacks on new york and washington. rauf said he hopes the church reconsiders. ""it is something that is not the right thing to do."" ""with freedom comes responsibility,"" he said. ""this is dangerous to our national security and is also the un-christian thing to do. ... jesus said to love your enemy. we are not your enemy."" responding to a poll showing 71 percent of new yorkers oppose the center's location, rauf he was going on television to explain his background and vision. ""i want to show them my face. show them my track record."" the imam spoke of ""a vision i've had for almost 15 years ... to establish a space that embodies the fundamental beliefs that we have as jews, christians and muslims, which is to love our god and to love our neighbor -- to build a space where we have a culture of worship."" rauf said he would continue speaking with families of those killed in the september 11, 2001, attacks. ""you cannot heal a trauma by walking away from it,"" he said. opposition goes against ""the fundamental american principle of separation of church and state,"" said rauf, adding he has been surprised by the controversy. the project, known as park51, is slated to include a variety of facilities, including a prayer room, a performing arts center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. it is planned for a site two blocks from the world trade center. a source familiar with park51 told cnn's allan chernoff last week that the structure is being planned as an 11-story building. it will cover 120,000 square feet -- 10,000 feet of which would be designated for the muslim prayer space. the developer is considering the possibility of an interfaith education/meditation/prayer space as well, the source said. opponents of the plan to build the center say it is too close to the site of the terror attacks and is an affront to the memory of those who died in the al qaeda strike. backers cite, among other things, first amendment rights and the need to express religious tolerance. those who know rauf describe him as a thoughtful man, a bridge builder who seeks to unite all faiths but who won't parse words when he sees religion used for nefarious ends. but he has landed in controversy before. he has chided the u.s. for killing civilians in baghdad. he said in 2005 that the u.s. had more muslim blood on its hands than ""al qaeda has on its hands of innocent non-muslims."" he has refused to accept western governments' designation of hamas as a terrorist group. shortly after the 9/11 attacks, he told cbs' ""60 minutes"" that ""united states policies were an accessory to the crime."" earlier this week, rauf wrote a commentary published online by the new york times. ""i have been struck by how the controversy has riveted the attention of americans, as well as nearly everyone i met in my travels,"" rauf wrote.

"-- vice president joe biden headlined a small catholic event wednesday in des moines, iowa, stoking speculation about his presidential aspirations. biden used most of his speech to tout nuns on the bus, a group of liberal catholic nuns who convey their message of social justice on road trips. but his praise for the group came in the form of stressing likely democratic issues in the midterm elections: the importance of health care and growth of the middle class. ""this nation is stronger when every voice is heard and everyone has a seat at the table,"" biden said on the steps of the iowa capitol. ""right now, only some of the voices are being heard, and as a result over the last couple of decades, things have gotten out of whack, folks."" biden says use of 'offensive' term shylock was a poor choice to those in the audience, the presidential politics of the vice president's visit were obvious. biden has admitted he is thinking about running for president, and a recent cnn/orc international poll found that 15% of iowa democrats would like him to be the democratic nominee in 2016. the vice president's trip comes on the heels of hillary clinton's much-talked about trip sunday to the harkin steak fry, the annual outdoor fund- raiser run by sen. tom harkin. the visit was clinton's most obvious step toward a presidential run since leaving the state department in 2013. in the same cnn/orc poll, 53% of iowa democrats favored the former secretary of state. ""joe tells it like it is, and we are blessed to have him,"" said craig stark from clive, iowa, who said he hopes biden runs in 2016. as for how he feels about clinton, stark said, ""well, we don't have dynasties like bush dynasties. ... to me we need new blood."" the crowd also featured some of biden's most ardent supporters from his short-lived 2008 presidential campaign. ""joe biden knows how to tell the truth, whether it is the politically correct thing to say or not,"" said john olsen, who proudly said he supported biden in the 2008 caucuses. ""you will become a fan of joe biden if you ever get a chance to meet him. he is the most personal, down-to-earth, lovable guy."" clinton's weekend visit was the first time she had been in iowa since 2008, but biden is no stranger to the hawkeye state. the vice president last visited a year ago when he spoke at the harkin steak fry, the most important annual event for iowa democrats that is widely seen as a must-stop for democrats considering a run at the white house. ""it's amazing when you come to speak at the steak fry, a whole lot of people seem to take notice. i don't know why the hell that is,"" biden joked then. ""you've attracted the entire national press corps here."" biden has also made a point to acknowledge iowa on a regular basis. biden called john lundell, the new mayor of coralville, iowa, to congratulate him on his victory in november. and in may, biden stopped by a party of iowans in washington for a lobbying trip. wednesday's speech was not biden's only stop in iowa. during his visit, the vice president did a rope-line photo session with supporters of local democratic campaigns, including congressional ones, according to campaign sources in iowa. the photo session was seen as a perk for supporting local democrats. biden's speech was the kickoff of the latest initiative from nuns on the bus in which the group will encourage voters in 36 cities along a 5,252-mile route to turn out and vote in the 2014 midterms. the vice president focused a great deal on what democrats are talking about ahead of the election: the poor and middle class. ""things are out of whack,"" biden said about the tax system in the united states. ""it comes down to a simple question of fairness. americans have always done best when we acted as one america. because when we do, the nation succeeds"" he added: ""it is time for a fair tax structure ... one that values hard work as much as inherited wealth. ... it is time to close these tax loopholes, folks."" nuns on the bus was also active around the 2012 midterms. the group organized a multistate tour to bring attention to rep. paul ryan's proposed budget cuts for medicare and other social welfare programs. sister simone campbell, executive director of the group behind the bus tour, told cnn that biden's attendance was meant to encourage civic engagement but said the event was ""not partisan."" ""right now, we are just doing what pope francis challenges us to do,"" campbell said. ""he says the heart of the problems of our society and our world is inequality and what we have to do is respond to the needs of the poor and those who are left out."" campbell didn't comment about biden's presidential chances, but she said she had an idea about why he agreed to attend the nuns on the bus event. ""every time i have seen him, he tells me that catholic sisters help keep him catholic,"" she said with a laugh. ""i think part of the reason he is coming is his own nourishment and his support of us.""","vice president joe biden travels to iowa, a key state in presidential campaigns"
"-- in january 1999, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced on live television that he was firing his defense minister, yitzhak mordechai. the minister, netanyahu argued, had colluded with his political rivals and was aiming to undermine the prime minister's authority. mordechai would go on to lead a centrist party and play a pivotal role in the victory of ehud barak and the labor party over netanyahu. fifteen years later, and netanyahu has again taken to the airwaves, announcing the firing of two senior cabinet members. is history set to repeat itself? on tuesday, netanyahu accused finance minister yair lapid and justice minister tzipi livni, the main centrist leaders of his center-to-far-right coalition, of disloyalty and of undermining his authority, publicly criticizing his policies and conspiring to form an alternative coalition. as a result, israel now heads to elections, tentatively scheduled for march. if you're scratching your head and wondering, ""didn't israel hold elections recently?"" then you're not alone. this knesset, the 19th, will be one of the shortest serving parliaments in israel's 66-year history. as a result, just two years after they last headed to the polls, israeli voters and politicians are wondering aloud why these elections are necessary. but will the outcome of the elections resemble those of 1999, which prompted netanyahu to take a hiatus from political life? netanyahu is a leader with remarkably few confidants, and has never excelled at the art of personal politics. after three terms as prime minister, ""netanyahu fatigue"" has set in across the political spectrum and even within his own party, and some have already suggested the election is effectively a referendum on the country's leader. and in some ways, netanyahu really is vulnerable. livni and netanyahu had clashed over a ""basic law"" (akin to a constitutional amendment) to reaffirm israel's status as the nation state of the jewish people, a bill that attracted scathing critiques from, among others, president ruvi rivlin (of netanyahu's own likud party), and his predecessor shimon peres. lapid and netanyahu clashed over measures to deal with the politically explosive issue of the high cost of living and a growing wealth gap between israelis. but perhaps most importantly, security issues -- especially the dramatic erosion of israelis' sense of personal security over the past six months -- have undermined netanyahu's position. after all, he has long prided himself on the relative calm during his years as prime minister. and, though hawkish, netanyahu had been far more hesitant to go to war than some of his more dovish peers. yet in the aftermath of the lengthy conflict in gaza last summer, some israelis were disappointed with netanyahu's decision not to topple hamas, which strengthened the political hand of right-wing leaders like minister of the economy naftali bennett of the jewish home party, a former aide of netanyahu's who left the prime minister's office amid acrimony, and foreign minister avigdor lieberman, another former aide and ally of netanyahu whose relations with the prime minister have seen several ups and downs. this has occurred against the backdrop of a wave of terrorist attacks against civilians, most notably a gruesome attack on a synagogue in jerusalem, midprayer, which left five dead. a palpable sense of personal fear is apparent and, naturally, nothing motivates voters more. all this said, this is not 1999. when then-defense minister mordechai left the likud, he joined a cascade of respected, veteran leaders who had broken with the young, brash and inexperienced prime minister. fast forward to today, and it is the veteran netanyahu, a steady hand and a known commodity (for better or worse) who is firing a brash, inexperienced lapid in the name of proper governance. the reality is that while public opinion currently holds netanyahu at fault for the political crisis, it remains at a loss as to who might replace him. in general, in democracies, incumbents lose more than challengers win; when leaders are replaced it is usually because the voters are fed up with their reigning leaders. and yet, for a change of leadership, there must be a credible challenger there to pick up the pieces. instead, today -- by attrition and political longevity -- netanyahu has found himself seemingly alone as a major player in the political sphere. the challenge for the opposition is therefore formidable. the israeli public has moved to the right and, with every terrorist attack, the hawkish camp solidifies its advantage. the most likely outcome, at present, would be a new netanyahu government with a stronger right wing and religious base, including the ultra-orthodox parties that were shunned from this coalition at lapid's demand. netanyahu may even bring weakened centrist figures back into the coalition, having lost their veto power in parliament. indeed, even those dismissed this week by netanyahu have so far refused to promise that they will not join another netanyahu coalition. and yet, a netanyahu defeat is not out of the question. he is the clear front-runner, but the campaign has barely begun, and party alignments are still unclear. livni may well join forces with either lapid or with labor; a new party of former likud minister moshe kahlon has yet to truly form but already shows considerable promise. in addition, several new entrants are expected in the political sphere as well, some of whom have impressive resumes in security, diplomacy and academia. it is by now a clichã© to call an israeli election the most important ever. instead, it is most likely that the outcome will be a continuation, or even accentuation, of current israeli policy. but with the dramatic challenges israel faces, domestically, regionally and internationally, expect the sense of malaise in israeli politics to deepen. these elections may simply be a prelude to a deeper political crisis.",natan sachs: benjamin netanyahu more vulnerable than he seems
"-- american airlines, already grappling with union issues and bankruptcy fallout, is now confronting a third problem: growing reports of loose seats. on tuesday, the company said another flight had experienced loose seats, bringing the total to three flights on two planes in a week. a plane headed from vail, colorado, to dallas on september 26 had seats come loose, the airline's vice president of safety confirmed tuesday. the same aircraft experienced a similar problem on a new york to miami flight on monday morning. that flight had to return to john f. kennedy airport. separately, a boeing 757 from boston to miami carrying 175 passengers diverted to new york on saturday when three seats in row 12 came loose shortly after takeoff. the airline said it would inspect 47 boeing 757 planes after the incidents. after incidents with airline seats, readers let loose ""originally, american planned to evaluate the seats on eight boeing 757 airplanes, but out of an abundance of caution, the decision was made to proactively evaluate a total of 47 boeing 757 airplanes that have the same model main cabin seats with a common locking mechanism,"" company spokeswoman andrea huguely said in a statement. ""american's internal investigation has focused on one of three types of main cabin seats on the 757s and how the rows of these three seats fit into the track that is used to secure the rows to the floor of the airplanes. our maintenance and engineering teams have discovered that the root cause is a saddle clamp improperly installed on the foot of the row leg,"" she said. the clamps were used on 47 of the company's 102 boeing 757 airplanes. so far, american airlines has inspected at least 36 planes and found that six -- including the two involved in the recent diversions -- had seats that were not properly secured. not all of the seats were loose, the company said, but they had the potential to become loose. eleven aircraft could be inspected wednesday. huguely said the seats issue does not appear to be connected to any one work group or maintenance facility, and apologized for any inconvenience to customers. ""safety is -- and always will be -- american's top concern,"" the spokeswoman said. the federal aviation administration is looking into the incidents of loose seats, which are the latest in a string of woes for american airlines. earlier tuesday, an american airlines flight from chicago to london made an unscheduled landing at shannon airport in ireland after a passenger reported a smoky odor, an airline spokesman said. american airlines flight 98, a boeing 777-200 carrying 246 passengers and 14 crew members, was diverted as a precaution, airline spokesman ian bradley said. an inspection revealed that the odor was coming from an overhead fan that had overheated, he said. niall maloney, head of operations for shannon airport, said such technical diversions are not uncommon. who wants to fly american airlines? the airline has also been beset recently by labor troubles, delays and flight cancellations. american, which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year, persuaded a judge to throw out its contract with the pilots union last month. since then, the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket. more than 1,000 american flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed in the past month alone. airline management has blamed the situation on pilots filing what it claims are frivolous reports about aircraft problems. the pilots union has denied management's assertion. late tuesday, a spokesman for the allied pilots association said it would resume contract negotiations with the airline. tom hoban said talks could start as early as wednesday. a company spokesman similarly said that negotiations are set to resume this week. meanwhile, robert gless, deputy director of the air transport division of the transport workers union of america, dismissed the notion that the problems with loose seats were linked to labor issues as ""without any basis in fact."" seat installation work is largely carried out by outside contractors, rather than maintenance personnel employed by the airline, he said in a statement. ""problems related to seats are less likely a labor problem, but rather a management issue related to outsourcing work to third-party facilities,"" he said. american airlines plans to increase its use of outside maintenance facilities, including in china and other overseas locations, as it seeks to exit bankruptcy, he added. seats come loose on two american airlines flights cnn's stephanie halasz, saskya vandoorne, sherri maksin, nick valencia and joe sutton contributed to this report.",the seats came loose during three flights on two planes

"-- islam lotfy may look like your average 35-year-old cairene. he's dark, clean-shaven, slightly chubby and wears glasses. there's nothing in his appearance that hints at his islamist identity, save for the prayer mark on his forehead. lotfy is, in fact, an active member of the muslim brotherhood -- egypt's largest opposition movement, which was banned from politics under the former regime of hosni mubarak. lotfy is a lawyer who specializes in human rights cases and also a member of a youth coalition that comprises young egyptian revolutionaries of varied ideologies. the young members of the coalition are united by a single goal: ensuring egypt's transition to a civil democratic state. more than four months after mubarak was forced from office in mass uprisings that erupted january 25, lotfy and other young muslim brotherhood members say they are feeling increasingly alienated from the islamist organization that shaped their political beliefs and influenced their behavior for most of their lives. ""we are not in agreement with all of the principles adopted by the older members of the group,"" lotfy acknowledged recently over espressos at groppi's, a tea room in downtown cairo. ""our motives are different ... we have egypt's best interests at heart."" prior to this year's mass protests that swept across egypt, it was rare to hear a younger member of the muslim brotherhood openly criticize the group's elder leaders. lotfy's statements suggest a possible split within the ranks of egypt's most organized political movement. behind the rift is support from younger members for abdel moneim aboul fotouh -- a former member of the muslim brotherhood who has announced his candidacy in the upcoming presidential election. the movement's older leaders had ruled out fielding a candidate in the presidential vote and have responded by blacklisting aboul fotouh. their decision to stay out of the presidential race, however, does not mean they lack political ambition. in statements to the news media made after mubarak was forced from office in february, mohamed morsi, a senior muslim brotherhood leader, declared that the group would seek 35% of the seats in parliament. but that was before the islamists scored a victory in the march referendum vote for proposed constitutional amendments. the result of the referendum was a resounding 77% favoring a yes vote. that outcome fueled the political ambitions of the islamists, who had warned voters that a no vote would have been ""un-islamic."" after the results were announced, muslim brotherhood leaders declared their intentions to compete for around 50% of parliamentary seats in the upcoming election. but the vote was a blow to the secularists and pro-democracy activists who had hoped to garner support for the drafting of a new constitution to replace the old one. fearing a rise in political islam, they have called for delaying the legislative election to allow more time for new political movements to organize. activists fear that, if the vote is held in two months as planned, the muslim brotherhood and remnants of mubarak's national democratic party, as the country's only organized parties, would dominate the lower house of parliament, called the people's assembly. calls to postpone the election have gone unheeded and the ruling supreme military council has announced that the vote will be held as scheduled. despite growing concerns among some analysts that the islamists are gaining ground, others remain confident that the group is unlikely to win more than 20% of the seats in parliament. activist hisham qassem pointed to the schisms within the muslim brotherhood and noted that the situation today differs greatly from what it was like during the election six years ago. ""in the 2005 election, disgruntled voters had flocked to the ballot box to vote ndp members out,"" he said. running as independents, the islamists won a fifth of the seats in parliament in the 2005 election. ""but, the brotherhood has now lost the 'i-hate-mubarak' votes,"" qassem said. on the streets of cairo, similar views were expressed by residents, including those in poor neighborhoods like imbaba and el doweika, where the muslim brotherhood has been most active, offering a range of much-needed social services. ""i will certainly vote in the next legislative election, but my vote won't go to the islamists,"" said salem fathalla, a mechanic in imbaba's working-class district. ""all they are after is a power grab."" ""the loyalty of the brotherhood lies with hamas in gaza and hezbollah in iran; they don't really care much about the welfare of this country,"" said taher abdel fattah, a bearded, 56-year-old taxi driver. ""no one knows what their agenda really is,"" he added. outlining the muslim brotherhood's vision for a ""new egypt,"" mohamed morsi said the group wants a civil democratic state with laws drawn from islamic shariah law. ""egypt is a predominantly muslim country, but we have christians too living in our midst; it is their country too,"" he said. it is therefore not surprising that the new political party launched by the muslim brotherhood under the name ""justice and freedom"" is open to christians -- and to women. the supreme military council now running the country has made it clear that no party will be allowed to run along religious lines. in a surprise move, the obama administration this week announced it would open a dialogue with the muslim brotherhood, saying that ""it is in the interests of the u.s. to engage with all parties that are committed to non-violence and that intend to compete for the parliament and the presidency."" mahmoud ghozlan, a spokesman for the islamist group, said the united states "" must first respect the people's choices for a true democracy, independence and respect their choice of leaders. we would welcome the open dialogue, if they are serious and transparent."" meanwhile, lotfy and at least 20 other young members of the muslim brotherhood have teamed up with other young activists espousing different ideologies to launch their own political party, ""egyptian trend,"" a move that risks their expulsion from the islamist bloc. mahmoud hussein, the brotherhood secretary general, has said that any muslim brotherhood members who join competing political parties will be penalized. ""members of the brotherhood are banned from joining any party except the brotherhood's own justice and freedom party,"" he recently told the independent al shorouk newspaper. lotfy said he regrets the move by brotherhood leadership to ostracize him and insisted that the new party he has helped to establish will work toward fulfilling the goals of the revolution. among its priorities will be ending corruption and social injustice, eradicating poverty and increasing civil liberties--demands made by opposition activists during 18 days of protest in tahrir square this year. lotfy, who has worked with other young activists in the 25 january youth coalition to chart a way toward a successful transition to democracy, said he hopes to use the experience to help build the new egypt.

""people went to work; it was just normal."" a reporter in this port city said businesses appeared open as usual, despite alassane ouattara's call over the weekend for the strike to force incumbent laurent gbagbo from power after his apparent loss in the november 28 presidential runoff. the ivory coast's independent electoral commission has named ouattara, an opposition leader, as the winner. but its constitutional council invalidated those results and declared that incumbent gbagbo won. ouattara's demand came amid mounting international pressure on gbagbo to step down. in paris, french foreign ministry spokesman bernard valero told reporters monday that the ministry had received an official request from ouattara's backers to put his ambassador into place, and was reviewing the person's credentials. the ivory coast has been paralyzed by the political stalemate, and scores of people have died in related violence. international powers, including the united states, the united nations and the african union, have recognized ouattara as the winner and urged gbagbo to cede power. about 14,000 ivory coast residents escaping the instability and violence have fled to eastern liberia, according to the u.n. refugee agency. a few deaths have been reported among the refugees, including a child who drowned during the crossing of the cestos river into butuo, liberia. observers saw malnourished children and people with malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhea. sixty-two percent of the refugees are children and 55 percent are female, liberia's representative to the u.n. high commissioner for refugees, ibrahima coly, told cnn on monday. ""so far, the liberian population has welcomed these people in a very warm way and they are sharing whatever they have,"" he said from monrovia. in general, the refugees are ""physically ok,"" he said. ""we have come across a few people who have their feet swollen because they have been walking for more than two or three days before reaching the border. we have seen also some kids who look a bit tired or malnourished, but these are really a limited number so far."" last friday, the 15-member economic community of west african states said it would not hesitate to use ""legitimate force"" if necessary to defuse the crisis. the african union has suspended ivory coast from the organization ""until such a time the democratically elected president effectively assumes state power."" the world bank has halted lending and disbursing funds to ivory coast and has closed its office in the country. kyung-wha kang, the u.n. deputy high commissioner for human rights, has said that between december 16 and december 21, human rights officers had ""substantiated allegations of 173 killings, 90 instances of torture and ill treatment, 471 arrests and detentions and 24 cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances."" she added that the actual numbers may be higher since restrictions on movement by u.n. personnel have made it ""impossible to investigate all the allegations of serious human rights violations, including reports of mass graves."" while acknowledging ""the situation is very, very difficult to live"" in, charles ble goude -- the nation's youth minister under gbagbo -- disputed the u.n. report's findings. he said gbagbo supporters were not to blame for the violence. instead, he accused ouattara's supporters of using weapons at what had been billed as peaceful rallies to attack soldiers. journalist eric agnero in abidjan, cnn's niki cook in paris and cnn's tom watkins contributed to this story.",new: french government reviewing credentials of ouattara's choice for ambassador

"justice elena kagan has some exciting news: ""i shot myself a deer."" new york city native kagan revealed over the weekend that she and conservative colleague justice antonin scalia have expanded their hunting forays. last year, ""he said 'it's time for big-game hunting.' so we actually went out to wyoming this past fall to shoot deer and antelope,"" kagan said, revealing some rare inside information about the justices and their interactions with each other outside the court. the newest member has become fast friends with one of the most conservative, and had earlier indicated they had been hunting for quail four or five times. all this started when president barack obama nominated kagan, 53, to the high court in 2010 and she made the rounds with senators. many of those private meetings involved questions about her views on hot-button issues. ""the nra (national rifle association) has quite a presence in judicial confirmations,"" kagan told an audience at the aspen ideas festival on saturday. ""and quite a few senators ask you your views on the second amendment,"" she said. while refusing to reveal how she would vote on such cases, kagan promised to keep an open mind. she previously revealed sen. jim risch asked her about gun rights, remarking the nominee may not realize how important the issue is to some americans. kagan admitted never having owned or fired a gun before. elena kagan: fast facts ""but i told the senator if i was fortunate enough to be confirmed, i would go hunting with justice scalia,"" she said. and that promise has been kept, first joining him on an excursion to a washington-area shooting range and then on several hunting trips. kagan's point in all this is to reinforce what few american believe of a court with five more conservative members and four who are more liberal. top supreme court decisions ""we get along remarkably well,"" she told the aspen audience. ""there are true and genuine friendships. it's true the (ideological) disagreements test people's capacity to work together, but to come back the next day and find your colleague just as delightful as you found him the day before -- we're all grownups and we manage to do that, and the court is full of great people,"" she said. ""we schmooze more than people think we do,"" she added. what's next? duck hunting, kagan said. hear kagan at aspen 'hot bench' the current supreme court is considered a ""hot bench"" and not because of the courtroom temperature or the relative good looks of the nine justices. ""hot"" as in the spirited, often competitive oral arguments that have livened up -- or injected chaos into -- public sessions where important legal and constitutional issues are openly debated and discussed. one person who thinks it is getting increasingly toasty is chief justice john roberts, who said on saturday that arguments have ""gone too far."" ""we do overdo it, the bench has gotten more and more aggressive,"" said the man who presides over those two-hour sessions. ""recent appointees have tended to be more active in questioning than the justices they replaced."" roberts revealed his concerns at a judicial conference in west virginia, saying he is often put into an uncomfortable position. ""i've had to act as an umpire in terms of the competition among my colleagues to get questions out,"" he said. while not offering excuses, he does say one reason may be the nine justices do not discuss the cases among themselves before arguments. ""so when we get out on the bench it's really the first we begin to get some clues about what our colleagues think,"" he said. ""we do tend sometimes to debate each other through counsel."" justice samuel alito, who is relatively subdued on the bench, was more blunt about the interruptions of counsel, and justices speaking over each other. ""trying to get in a question at oral argument is really like trying to grab an item that's on sale at walmart the day after thanksgiving,"" alito said in his trademark deadpan manner two weeks ago, in a speech at the state bar of texas. no joking justice samuel alito has long had a reputation of taking his job seriously. unlike chief justice john roberts, antonin scalia, or elena kagan, he rarely jokes from the bench. and for those who do not know him personally or covered him for any length of time, his personal demeanor can come off as harsh or overly intense. now some progressive groups have suggested alito's recent behavior was a violation of the code of conduct for united states judges. the washington post and atlantic magazine said he acted with ""judicial intemperance"" and ""inexcusable rudeness"" at the june 25 public session of the court. justice ruth bader ginsburg, sitting next to alito, was reading an oral dissent, criticizing the majority's ruling in a workplace discrimination case. the isolated media reports said alito, without speaking, rolled his eyes, shook his head, and looked at the ceiling. the reporters claimed other incidents of ""rude behavior"" in the days prior when justices sonia sotomayor and kagan also spoke from the bench. cnn did not witness the alleged incidents, but other justices have long been observed appearing a bit distracted when opinions are read in open session. it is a process that can drag on for half-hour or more when the rest of the court must sit in silence. the backdrop to all this involves alito's public display during the nationally televised 2010 state of the union address by president barack obama. alito was among several conservative justices sitting just feet away, when the president attacked a majority ruling on campaign finance reform. cameras showed alito appearing to mouth the words ""not true"" at obama's assertion the opinion would open floodgates to uncontrolled corporate spending in federal elections. the progressive alliance for justice now says alito's demeanor last week suggested a disrespect for women. ""perhaps alito felt he could pull the same stunt again because this time, no one outside the courtroom actually would see his antics -- they could only be described by those who were there,"" said a blog posting by the group monday. cameras are not allowed in the high court. those who know the 63-year-old new jersey native are privately upset at suggestions alito is personally antagonistic toward women, or to any of his colleagues. several people close to him told cnn alito is a sensitive, thoughtful man, without affectation or animus. they also admit he possesses an often biting sense of humor. in a letter to the editor published friday in the washington post, two former law clerks called the media reports ""character attacks"" on the conservative justice. ""this suggestion is offensive and couldn't be further from the truth, as his many female clerks can attest,"" said william ranney levi and dana remus. ""those of us who have been fortunate to work closely with justice alito know that he is a good man who serves every day with humility, dedication and incredible intelligence and insight."" alito himself had no comment on the reports.","conservative and liberal supreme court justices fast friends, hunt together"
"-- much of middle america baked in a heat wave sunday, with little respite in sight as temperatures and humidity are expected to make it feel warmer than 100 degrees fahrenheit through much of this week. excessive heat warnings have been declared by the national weather service in at least 14 states sunday, most of those in the upper midwest. excessive heat watches were in place in indiana and kentucky, with heat advisories (the least imminent of the three) in effect for four other states. several daily temperature records were broken sunday -- from alpena, michigan, south to miami, florida.

""that takes a toll on your body,"" beitlich explained.

"-- a former chief of the basque terrorist group eta has been sentenced to 105 years in prison for ordering the assassination of a politician, according to a copy of the court ruling, made public monday. it is the first sentence in a case involving eta from the national court, which handles terrorism cases, since eta announced last month ""a definitive cessation of its armed activity,"" raising hopes that decades of separatist violence may finally be over. the maximum that can be served in spanish prison is 40 years, although courts often hand down a longer sentence for terrorist attacks. spain has no death penalty. in the sentence issued last friday but made public on monday, the court ruled that francisco javier garcia gaztelu, whom spanish authorities called the military chief of eta when he was captured in 2001, ordered the assassination of a basque socialist politician, fernando buesa. buesa and his bodyguard were killed in the basque city of vitoria in northern spain in february 2000 when they walked past a vehicle that contained a hidden bomb that was exploded by remote control. garcia gaztelu, now 45, was sentenced to 30 years each for the killings of buesa and his bodyguard, 13 years each for two people injured in the attack, and additional time mainly for damage caused by the bomb, the court said. the government, courts and police have said they will not halt the court cases pending against eta operatives despite the outlawed group's announcement last month. listed as a terrorist organization by spain, the united states and the european union, eta is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern spain and southwestern france. eta's announcement last month followed a recent push for the group to abandon violence permanently. that effort was led by international figures who include sinn fein leader gerry adams of northern ireland and former u.n. secretary-general kofi annan. prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero termed eta's announcement as being of ""transcendental importance"" and a ""victory for democracy."" ""ours will be a democracy without terrorism, but not without memory,"" zapatero said, referring to 829 people killed by eta and their families. the prime minister said that it would be up to spain's next government -- which will be formed after parliamentary elections on november 20 -- to lead the peace process.",francisco javier garcia gaztelu has been in custody since 2001
"-- the bay pilot who steered a container ship into the san francisco bay bridge in 2007, causing a massive oil spill, pleaded guilty friday to violating misdemeanor pollution laws and faces up to 10 months in prison, federal prosecutors said. the korean-flagged cosco busan rammed into san francisco's bay bridge on november 7, 2007. prosecutors dropped felony charges against him. john joseph cota, 61, pleaded guilty to violating the oil pollution act of 1990, a law enacted in the wake of the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska, and the migratory bird treaty act. cota gave orders to officers controlling the korean-flagged cosco busan as the ship was leaving fog-shrouded san francisco bay, california, on november 7, 2007. the 901-foot ship struck fenders around the base of a bridge support tower, rupturing two of the ship's fuel tanks and spilling about 53,000 gallons of oil into the bay. at least 2,000 migratory birds were killed. at the time, officials estimated clean-up costs at $60 million. ""today's guilty plea is a reminder that the cosco busan crash was not just an accident, but a criminal act,"" said john c. cruden, acting assistant attorney general for the justice department's environment and natural resources division. ""john cota was an experienced ship pilot that was handsomely compensated for his special knowledge of ships and expertise in local waters. his failure to act prudently under the circumstances caused a major environmental disaster that could have been far worse,"" said joseph russoniello, u.s. attorney for the northern district of california. cota has piloted about 4,000 ships in the bay during his 27-year career, said his attorney, jeffrey bornstein. bonstein said cota is remorseful and accepts responsibility for his part in the accident. but bornstein also criticized the accident investigation. he said it was unfair and protected others who also bear responsibility. ""captain cota has been vilified by the media, lost his job, will now go to jail for at least 60 days, and still suffers under the weight of crushing civil lawsuits,"" bornstein said. ""he understands and accepts responsibility for his part in the accident and hopes that others will step forward and accept their roles and responsibilities as well."" cota will be sentenced to 2 to 10 months in prison and be fined between $3,000 and $30,000, if the plea terms are accepted by u.s. district court judge susan illston. sentencing is scheduled for june 19. prosecutors said the plea included factual admissions by cota, including an acknowledgment his negligence ""was a proximate cause of the [oil] discharge."" cota also admitted that he failed to discuss the planned route with the ship's master or crew as required, or to use the ship's radar in the final approach to the bridge. he also failed to recognize two red triangles on the ship's electronic chart system that marked bridge tower buoys. attorney bornstein said the ship's master told cota the red triangles represented the lights on the bridge, ""which in capt. cota's knowledge were at the center of the span. he had no reason to think that the master didn't know what he was talking about."" see the path as part of the plea agreement with cota, the government agreed to dismiss false statement charges pending against him. those charges alleged that cota failed to disclose his medications on required coast guard forms. the court ruled those charges would be tried separately. but cota admitted in the plea papers filed friday his 2006 physical exam form failed to disclose some of the medications he was prescribed. among them were two pain medications, three different drugs prescribed as sleeping aids and an antidepressant prescribed for an off-brand purpose. bornstein said there is no evidence that medication played any role in the accident. at friday's hearing, illston set trial for the remaining defendant in the case, the ship's manager, fleet management ltd.

"editor's note: tachi yamada is the president of the global health program at the bill & melinda gates foundation. he writes for cnn's vital signs about how the island of zanzibar has virtually eliminated the disease over the past five years. zanzibar, tanzania -- i recently accompanied margaret chan, director general of the who, and ray chambers, u.n. special envoy for malaria, on a trip to africa to see firsthand the region's fight against malaria. a hospital ward on the tanzanian island of zanzibar stands empty. the single most memorable image of the trip was from a pediatric hospital ward on the tanzanian island of zanzibar: a dozen beds and not a single patient in them. imagine that. i have searing memories of visiting wards much like this elsewhere in the world where there were as many as three children to a bed and more sleeping on the floor, deathly ill with malaria. where have all the patients gone? after all, malaria is a big killer in much of the developing world. it is probably the most prevalent disease that mankind has ever suffered. each year, there are over 250 million cases and almost one million deaths -- most of them young children, and the vast majority in africa. but in many countries, malaria is also a success story. since 2000, the number of reported malaria cases, deaths, or both has declined by at least half in 25 countries. zanzibar -- a relatively small but striking example -- has virtually eliminated the disease over the past five years. these successes show what a combination of political will, technical resources, and financial commitment can do when applied to a strategy that works. there is no question that leaders and health officials in sub-saharan africa and other parts of the world recognize the horrible toll of malaria. in fact, uganda's minister of health told us that he himself has suffered from malaria three times this year. this understanding of the problem and the availability of tools to address it led the bill & melinda gates foundation in 2005 to fund the malaria control and evaluation program in africa, which focused on malaria control in zambia. our investment was relatively small, but it helped zambia create a comprehensive and aggressive national plan to fight malaria. with funding from the president's malaria initiative, the world bank, and the global fund to fight aids, tuberculosis, and malaria, zambia greatly expanded the use of proven tools to prevent and treat the disease, such as the use of indoor spraying with insecticides, distribution of bednets, and effective malaria treatment in government clinics. as a result, in three short years, the malaria incidence in zambia declined by more than 50 percent, and child mortality from all causes, including malaria, declined by 30 percent. zambia, zanzibar, and other success stories provide a beacon of hope for the dream of a world free of malaria, articulated by bill and melinda gates in 2007 when they put out a call to eradicate the disease. today, there are a number of outspoken people who question the value and true impact of development assistance. the example of malaria shows that with political will, advice on planning, funds to purchase sound, scientifically validated tools, and the courage to measure results objectively, development assistance can have an enormous impact in a short period of time. where have all the patients gone? home, where they can live happier, healthier lives. let them be the retort to the skeptics of development assistance.",yamada: the number of malaria cases has declined by at least half in 25 countries

"-- the ongoing penn state scandal reached if not its denouement thursday at least its climax with the release of the report prepared under the auspices of former fbi director louis freeh. the report answers numerous questions about who knew about jerry sandusky's abuse of children as well as how suspicions, rumors and allegations were handled. for many of us the most disturbing element of the report already had been intimated in the press, the role that coach joe paterno played in handling complaints against athletes internally and disregarding both penn state's procedures and also the law. while charitably one could suggest that paterno saw discipline as his role as a coach and mentor, less charitable interpretations also make sense, particularly a desire to maintain the reputation of the program and the income and prestige it brought. beyond motives, however, the creation of an environment where discipline took place ""off the books"" was destined to lead to a collapse at some point. unfortunately when this collapse occurred its victims were children. news: penn state leaders disregarded victims, 'empowered' sandusky freeh said in releasing his report that the investigation's ""most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of sandusky's child victims by the most senior leaders at penn state."" ""the most powerful men at penn state failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who sandusky victimized,"" he said. ""messrs. spanier, schultz, paterno and curley never demonstrated, through actions or words, any concern for the safety and well-being of sandusky's victims until after sandusky's arrest."" that remark, which many of us hoped never to read, speaks directly to the findings of the report and to the organizational and moral failures of penn state. even more directly, the report directly chastises the university's board of trustees for a failure to exercise its oversight functions and its dereliction in ensuring that it was appropriately and adequately informed of risks to the university. not only did the university's administration not inform to the board about the suspicions of and allegations against sandusky, the board failed in its responsibility in establishing a system to seek such information. most shocking, however, given its legal obligations, was penn state's complete dereliction in its responsibilities under express laws, including those mandating reporting and protecting those who bring violations to light. news: reactions to penn state report flood social media freeh's ability to identify and order the moral failings of the university in the most appropriate, empathetic and humane way is admirable. he centers his condemnations primarily on the fact that at every level --the board, the president and paterno -- no one expressed any concern for the boys whose lives were devastated by the abuse inflicted upon them by sandusky. regardless of the structural, administrative and disciplinary failures at penn state, the central moral failing was that the school cared more about its reputation, its football team, and even sandusky than about his victims. the school grossly mis-ordered values and failed to meet its duties. what freeh has found is most disturbing and depressing. a superior institution of higher education and a football program and coach admired for their express commitment to principles proved themselves to have feet of clay and appalling disregard for the safety and security of many innocent children. news: key players in penn state report penn state's failings should be a warning to every organization and to all of us. we protect our reputations by doing the right thing, not by hiding our failings. indeed, even amid discovery of error and wrongdoing, reputations are enhanced by acknowledging, dealing with them immediately and directly, and working to minimize their recurrence. if we can draw a salutary lesson from this scandal, it is that. unfortunately, for the innocent child victims of sandusky's predation, the lesson has come too late. maybe, if other organizations take these lessons to heart it will prevent future abuses and save others from becoming victims. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of edward queen.",louis freeh releases report showing failures by penn state administrators

""the relevant organ of the dprk is carrying on the investigation into them and making preparations for bringing them before court on the basis of the already confirmed charges,"" the report said, using using an abbreviation of the country's official name, the democratic people's republic of korea. the u.s. state department called on north korea to release the two men on humanitarian grounds. asylum bid? north korea said in late april that it had taken miller into custody, claiming he had come to the country seeking asylum and had torn up his tourist visa. it announced the detention of fowle in early june, saying he had violated the law by acting ""contrary to the purpose of tourism."" it didn't provide details at the time on what exactly he was accused of doing. but the japanese news agency kyodo cited unidentified diplomatic sources as saying that fowle was part of a tour group and that he was detained in mid-may after allegedly leaving a bible in a hotel where he had been staying. although north korea regularly denounces the united states as a sworn enemy in its state-run media, americans are able to visit the country as tourists. but the u.s. state department says it ""strongly recommends against all travel by u.s. citizens to north korea."" swedish embassy involved ""contact with an official looking after consular affairs, treatment, etc. in the course of investigation are being made in line with the laws of the relevant country,"" kcna said monday. in practice, that means that north korean authorities have been in touch with the swedish embassy, which represents american interests in the country. ""out of humanitarian concern for mr. fowle and mr. miller and their families, we request north korea release them so they may return home,"" said u.s. state department spokeswoman jen psaki. she said the swedish embassy had carried out visits to both men in north korean custody. kenneth bae case north korea is also holding kenneth bae, a korean-american missionary who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2013 by a court that said he had carried out acts aimed at bringing down the regime of leader kim jong un. psaki on monday repeated a request for bae to be pardoned and released. although north korea contains a number of state-controlled churches, the totalitarian regime forbids independent religious activities, viewing them as potential threats to its authority. other americans detained in the north have later been released. last year, pyongyang freed merrill newman, an 85-year-old veteran of the korean war who was on an organized private tour in the country, after holding him for several weeks. cnn's k.j. kwon reported from seoul, and jethro mullen reported and wrote from hong kong. cnn's mary lucas grace and brian todd contributed to this report.",new: the u.s. calls for both men to be released on humanitarian grounds
"-- almost hidden in the spectacular red rock country of northwestern new mexico is a tiny charity that educates and houses almost 200 native american children and their families. the st. bonaventure indian mission and school, affiliated with the roman catholic diocese of gallup, mostly survives on donations, which it promises to use wisely. the need is apparent once you step onto the grounds. and that's why mission executives agreed to work with one of the world's largest direct mail companies, which solicits donations for hundreds of nonprofit and charity clients in the united states. they wanted to raise as much money as they could. they signed a contract with quadriga art in 2008 and, according to internal financial statements, saw more than $9 million in donations flow in over a four-year period. but almost none of the money went to the mission. instead, school officials acknowledge that the mission owes more than $5 million to quadriga art. and evidence suggests that several other charities also owe the company huge sums of money it raises questions about how much of the billions of dollars americans donate each year actually help the intended charities, something that the senate finance committee is exploring as part of its ongoing investigation into another charity linked to quadriga. on tuesday, the committee issued questions to quadriga officials to explore how the company raised money for the disabled veterans national foundation, it said. in response, quadriga said, it ""volunteered"" some information to the committee and will cooperate with the investigation. in addition to the senate inquiry, attorneys general for new york and california are investigating quadriga for possible fraudulent practices, sources say. the company has provided documents to new york investigators, multiple sources confirm to cnn. and sources say california officials have also requested documents from key quadriga executives. the executive director of st. bonaventure indian mission and school, chris halter, went to new york to meet with quadriga officials after being contacted by cnn, sources said. in an e-mail, halter wrote that the debt was the result of a ""pilot program"" that did not succeed. ""in this effort quadriga/brickmill (brickmill is an affiliated marketing services company) agreed to finance the mailings and bear the risk of any losses if the campaign did not succeed, "" halter said in that email. ""unfortunately, this project started just a month before the recession began and was not profitable. accordingly, the mission negotiated with quadriga/brickmill to end the pilot project early and quadriga/brickmill concurred. as had been agreed, the mission now owes quadriga/brickmill nothing for this pilot project,"" halter also told cnn. ""quadriga has helped enable the mission to deliver water and food services and keep its school open during lean economic times by allowing the mission to delay repayment of part of its bills on generous, no interest payment terms."" but the roman catholic diocese of gallup, which has overall responsibility for the st. bonaventure mission, says it knew nothing of the debt until it was contacted by cnn. ""we have serious concerns about that company,"" said james mason, an attorney for the diocese. ""and the fact that they reached out to an entity in our diocese and potentially would jeopardize these good services, educational and otherwise that are being provided."" in an e-mail, quadriga spokewoman melissa schwartz wrote, ""sometimes the program is successful, and sometimes it results in a net loss for quadriga art."" she added, ""we are proud of our ability to take on start-up organizations that do not have an email list, donor file or the money on hand that it takes to build a long-term, revenue-producing direct mail program."" in a web video posted by quadriga ceo mark schulhof to his company's clients, he did not address directly the question of state or senate investigations. ""not once have we been fined; not once have we ever been charged,"" schulhof said. ""we get inquiries all the time from states"" because forms are filled out incorrectly. other charities internal financial documents show that at least 11 charities now owe the company millions of dollars, a result of direct mail campaigns failing to bring in enough money from donations to cover the cost of the campaigns themselves. in a statement, a quadriga spokesman said the financial information was ""grossly inaccurate"" when it came to profit numbers. the company further stated that ""a complete, independent, third party audit of quadriga's financial information has indicated that quadriga has not made any net profit on the accounts you list."" spokesmen for several quadriga charity clients acknowledge that they owe the company amounts ranging from about $200,000 to millions of dollars. leading the list of charities owing money to quadriga is the washington-based disabled veterans national foundation. the senate finance committee began investigating the foundation's tax-exempt status after a series of cnn reports broadcast in may. florida investigators have been examining the foundation amid accusations of creating misleading representations in a direct mail campaign authored by quadriga, according to the state department of agriculture and consumer affairs. documents show that the disabled veterans national foundation owes quadriga more than $15 million. as part of their investigation, florida officials say the foundation, which says it has raised nearly $70 million in donations since 2007, has also acknowledged an extraordinary payment to another charity. according to documents obtained under the florida public records law, the disabled veterans national foundation agreed to pay $325,000 to a charity called the disabled veterans life memorial foundation. a letter from the memorial foundation's chief operating officer, rick fenstermacher, says the payment was because of a ""striking resemblance"" between letters appealing for money on behalf of the disabled veterans national foundation and similar letters mailed on behalf of the memorial foundation. ""it appeared that our proprietary information and intellectual property rights had been violated,"" the letter stated. in the settlement agreement, quadriga did not admit to any wrongdoing, and the veterans charity said the agreement ""speaks for itself."" the disabled veterans national foundation also said the mailings in question were out the door before the settlement could be agreed upon. despite the huge payment, nowhere in the disabled veterans national foundation's mailings to prospective donors did it acknowledge that donated funds would be used to pay for a out-of-court settlement to another charity. the common denominator between the two charities is their direct-mail fundraiser, quadriga. the memorial foundation, which plans to build a statue and memorial to disabled veterans on capitol hill near the rayburn house office building, stopped using quadriga in 2008, five months before the settlement agreement was reached. as for the disabled veterans national foundation, it has embarked on an expensive new mailing campaign, launched after the senate finance committee began its investigation. on behalf of the charity, quadriga said, it sent 750,000 letters, each with a $1 bill enclosed, in an effort to raise more money. roger craver, a veteran of more than 50 years of direct-mail fundraising on behalf of nonprofits and charities, offered his opinion on the ethics and legalities of surrounding quadriga and similar outfits: ""the fact that (that) company puts forth money for this purpose is not unethical per se. it's not illegal per se,"" he said. ""but what is problematic is ... if the charity is promising to do something with the money that the donor sends and there's no money going to it ... if no money has gone to the charitable purpose, then that's fraudulent."" ""big mistake"" the ceo of another quadriga client, a los angeles-based charity called help the children, said he had made a ""big mistake"" in signing a contract with the company. roger presgrove said he tried to cancel the contract a year after signing it but was unable to do so. he said quadriga told him that help the children owed $285,000, and the charity couldn't pay it. ultimately, the debt was whittled down to less than $200,000, presgrove said, which was still money he did not have. of the roughly $800,000 raised in donations by the quadriga campaign, presgrove said, his charity kept about $32,000: less than 5%. ""so we had to take money out of our reserves to keep our programs going (to) fulfill what we said we would do. and in the meantime, we're the ones who are struggling, and they're the one who is doing extremely well."" asked whether he felt that quadriga had ""ripped him off,"" presgrove replied, ""oh, yeah."" but after cnn asked quadriga for its reaction, presgrove retracted his statements. presgrove acknowledged that before he spoke to cnn, he e-mailed a quadriga executive, saying that unless he was let out of his contract, he would go to cnn with his story. in less than an hour, a quadriga executive agreed. ""i think it is in everyone's interest to end this and move on,"" the executive wrote back. despite his agreement with quadriga, presgrove granted an on-camera interview anyway. two days later, cnn received a phone call from a quadriga spokesman, and presgrove himself wrote cnn, saying he wanted to retract what he had said. the quadriga spokesman also said presgrove's interview should be retracted because he had just undergone a medical procedure and was in no condition to answer questions. quadriga claimed that cnn had ""dragged"" him to an interview. cnn disputes that assertion. still later, presgrove texted cnn, asking not to air the interview: ""i have to get out of this contract and that was the deal. no interview and i'm out. sorry."" watch anderson cooper 360° weeknights 8pm et. for the latest from ac360° click here.",tiny new mexico charity owes $5 million to direct mail firm
"-- ex-new york police commissioner bernard kerik was sentenced to 48 months in prison thursday after pleading guilty to charges of lying to bush administration officials who vetted his unsuccessful 2004 nomination for homeland security secretary. the sentence, handed down by u.s. district judge stephen robinson, exceeded the 27- to 33-month prison term recommended by federal prosecutors. ""with great power comes great responsibility and comes great consequences,"" robinson said in court. kerik, accompanied by his wife and son, addressed the court before his sentencing. ""i make no excuses,"" the former police commissioner said. ""i take full responsibility for my actions. i have learned from this. i know i will be punished, but i only wish you would allow me return to my wife and two little girls as soon as possible."" kerik, 54, pleaded guilty in november to tax fraud and six other felonies and has been under house arrest in franklin lakes, new jersey, since then. he must surrender to authorities to begin his sentence by may 17. after the sentencing, kerik told reporters he wanted to ""apologize to the american people for the mistakes i've made and for which i have just accepted responsibility."" ""as history is written, i can only hope that i will be judged for the 30 years of service that i've given to this country and the city of new york,"" he said. in court papers, prosecutors said kerik denied to a white house official that there was ""any possible concern"" about his relationships with contractors involved in renovating an apartment of his or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors. kerik had been scheduled to go to trial on a variety of corruption charges, including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $255,000 in renovations to his riverdale, new york, apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of new york. he pleaded guilty to that charge and several tax-related counts in november. kerik was new york police commissioner from 1998 to 2002, a tenure that included the september 11, 2001, attacks that destroyed the world trade center and killed more than 2,700 people. he spent a brief stint in iraq training the country's police force after the u.s. invasion in 2003, and president bush nominated him to be homeland security secretary in 2004. however, kerik withdrew from consideration after allegations surfaced that he had employed a nanny with a murky immigration status. in 2006, he pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while he working as city corrections commissioner. under his plea agreement, he paid $221,000 in fines and avoided jail time. his admission dogged the 2008 presidential campaign of his longtime patron, former new york mayor rudy giuliani, who said his endorsement of kerik had been ""a mistake."" kerik made an unsuccessful appeal for clemency to bush in 2008, according to court papers released in october.","new: bernard kerik tells reporters he wants to ""apologize to the american people"""

"-- let me tell you about the amazing kid who lives in our house. she's 6 and she is the most hysterical, sarcastic, intelligent, funny, sweet, naã¯ve, confident, strong, independent, considerate person i have ever met. i have no idea how she got to be this way. you see, my husband is a quadriplegic. i care for him, i work full-time, and there are days when i feel like our daughter gets very little of my attention. isabel was 6 months old when her dad was injured. during her first six months, he was just ok at changing diapers and he had no fashion sense when it came to dressing her. but he loved feeding her and playing with her and those two spent tons of time together. then, our lives changed. it was december 21, 2007, three days before isabel's first christmas. at our annual christmas party with our friends, around midnight, my husband decided to jump into the snow to make a snow angel. why? because he's ben. i remember looking at him, smiling and shaking my head. he looked at me, grinned and ran out into the snow -- and never got up. he had broken his neck at the c4/c5 level and was paralyzed completely from the shoulders down. i do not remember my daughter's first christmas. my parents and sisters spent it with her while i was in the hospital with my husband. i went from hugging and snuggling her before the accident to barely being able to look at her without crying. i couldn't even hold her because the responsibility of being a ""single parent"" in the physical sense was so overwhelming, i shut down. every single minute of the day, i begged someone to fix my husband. i remember one night in the icu, the nurses got a rocker for me from the nicu and made me sit with isabel in ben's room. it was like they knew we needed time together, just the two of us. it felt very foreign to me for a very long time. i felt like her babysitter, not her mom. while i rocked her, i stared at her wondering how we were going to manage as a family and how unfair it was to her that we were putting her through so much. my mom became isabel's surrogate parent for almost eight months because i needed to focus on my husband. she was the one who got up with our daughter when she cried, and brought her to visit in rehab. looking back, it still hurts to know how much time i missed with my daughter. i missed her first steps. i missed her first words. i missed so much. and it took years until i could let that all go, until i felt like her mom again. i'm finally realizing how hard it must have been on my husband. he was no longer able to hold her. to help her. to play with her. he had to watch from the sidelines while everyone else took care of his child. as new parents, you expect things to be difficult. but when dealing with a spinal cord injury, difficult doesn't begin to describe it. i went from caring for a 6-month-old with my husband to caring for a 6-month-old and my husband. i liked how things were before the injury. my strong, confident husband took charge and i followed. in a second, it changed. i had to be responsible for our family. i am always the first one up and the last one to bed. i am pushed to the limit physically, emotionally and mentally almost every single day. but it has made us stronger. as we learned how to live our ""new"" life, things became easier. we developed a routine. we found our sense of humor again. we worried about the relationship between ben and isabel. a lot. every time she said that she didn't like him or want him around, we worried that it was because of his injury. we made a big deal out of it. we stressed about it. we talked to her teachers about it. we talked to a counselor about it. we thought that our daughter wouldn't connect with her dad because of his injury. it turns out we were wrong. very wrong. isabel is your typical 6-year-old who just happens to have learned more about life than most ever do, one who will place her hands on my face and solemnly tell me, ""everything will be ok."" our daughter loves her daddy. she knows he's disabled. she knows he broke his neck. she knows there are limitations to what they can do together but trust me, they push the boundaries every single day. more than once, she's come running to tell me that daddy got stuck in the mud or fell forward in his wheelchair or ran out of battery while on a walk. she's come to me crying because she bumped her head or arm falling from her daddy's chair when she was climbing on it, or riding in his lap, or jumping onto the couch from his chair. too many times i've had to yell at both of them for chasing each other through the house; he in his chair and she on her scooter. too many times i've had to tell them to stop it because they were about to get into trouble together. she's figured out the best way to crawl into his lap to watch a movie. she climbs onto the counter so she can give him a kiss at night. she turns off his chair when he's in her room at night so he has to stay while she falls asleep. she puts clips in his hair and puts makeup on him to play dress up. she rolls her eyes when ben tells a terrible joke and thinks it's hilarious when she tries to tickle him, even though he cannot feel it. isabel doesn't see ben as a quadriplegic. she sees him as her father. she goes to him when she's sad. she celebrates with him when she's happy. his injury does not define their relationship. their love for each other does. every day i get to see that love they share grow into something even bigger. she has taught me how to look past her dad's disability to see him for who he really is: my husband. the man i married. the man i love. that little kid has taught me more about love and life in her six years than anyone ever could. she taught us how to laugh again. how to have fun again. how to love each other again. she was the one who taught us that life was worth living. i cannot wait to see else what else she can teach us as she grows.","erin hayes' husband broke his neck on december 21, 2007"
"-- it is another landmark in the career of one of football's greatest ever players. another two goals in the colors of barcelona took lionel messi to 71 in the european champions league -- level with the all-time record holder raul. the argentina striker grabbed both goals as the spanish giants beat ajax 2-0 in amsterdam, and now needs just one more to go clear of the legendary spain striker. messi is already barca's all-time leading scorer and a four-time ballon d'or winner at the age of 27. not only did he move level with raul in the champions league scoring charts, he also edged one ahead of another stand out player of this generation -- cristiano ronaldo. the real madrid striker failed to add to his tally in his side's 1-0 victory over liverpool on tuesday night, but the battle to beat raul's record is still very much on. messi's first came from that rare source -- his head. his fine finish from marc bartra's cross was only the fourth header in that bumper haul of 71 goals. and with 15 minutes left, messi slid in to polish off a pedro cross from the left to pull himself level with raul. his brace also secured barca's spot in the last 16 of the competition. man city implosion elsewhere, it was another miserable european night for english premier league champions manchester city. despite its riches and its legion of international stars, manuel pellegrini's men sank to rock bottom in its group after a 2-1 home defeat to cska moscow, who had never before won in england. only once has city made it out of the group stages -- last season -- when it was beaten 4-1 by spanish giants barcelona in its last 16 clash. despite city's victory over neighbors united in the manchester derby on sunday, it has been in poor form of late, failing to win any of its three matches before that. and in a subdued atmosphere, it fell behind inside 96 seconds to a striker fast becoming its nemesis -- seydou doumbia. the ivorian rose highest to meet an early free kick and plant it beyond england goalkeeper joe hart to score his fourth goal against city. doumbia's fellow countryman yaya toure brought the home side level with a stunning free kick of his own, firing into the top corner from 25 yards out. but city self destructed again, a poor clearance from gael clichy allowing bebras natcho to pick doumbia, who fired into the net past hart. city's task became more difficult when brazilian midfielder fernandinho was sent off with 20 minutes remaining and things went from bad to worse ten minutes later when toure was also dismissed. cska saw out the remaining minutes to leapfrog city in the table and keep its own qualification hopes alive. ""it's very difficult to understand why we played so badly,"" pellegrini told sky sports. ""we were nervous. we didn't play. it's difficult to know why you have such a low performance from important players. it's a strange moment. ""i don't think it's just this competition -- in the last two weeks we are not playing the way we normally do. i don't understand but we must find a reason. it's a crisis of confidence."" in the group's other clash, bayern munich followed up its 7-1 win over as roma in italy with a 2-0 success at home, franck ribéry and mario götze grabbing the goals. another english club -- premier league leaders chelsea -- struggled against nk maribor, drawing 1-1 with the slovenian minnows. after squandering a string of first-half chances, jose mourinho's side were made to pay when agim ibraimi curled a fine effort into the top corner beyond petr cech on 50 minutes. luka zahovic missed a glorious chance to double maribor's lead, firing over the bar from barely six yards out with the goal gaping, before nemanja matic equalized with 17 minutes to go. belgium international eden hazard had a late penalty saved by jasmin handanovic, but chelsea extended its lead at the top of the group after german club schalke were beaten 4-2 by sporting lisbon in portugal. ""i was not happy with the team or the performance,"" mourinho told sky sports. ""i think we deserved to win but with this referee i have a long story from my italian times but i don't want to go in this direction. ""they gave absolutely everything -- they fought fantastically well for their point. it is a big day for them so it is also fair to praise them."" elsewhere, paris saint-germain beat apoel nicosia 1-0 thanks to edinson cavani's goal after 54 seconds -- the quickest in this year's competition so far. spanish side athletic bilbao slumped to a 2-0 defeat by portuguese outfit porto, while ukrainian club shakthar donestsk beat bate borisov 5-0, two weeks after winning 7-0 in belarus.",lionel messi pulls level with raul's record haul of 71 champions league goals
"a dispute between a muslim gold shop owner and two buddhist sellers erupted in clashes that left 10 people dead, 20 injured and four mosques burned to the ground in central myanmar, local officials said thursday. the clashes began wednesday morning in meiktila township after a quarrel between the shop owner and the sellers, police said. the sellers were beaten up by four other muslim shop owners, police said. in retaliation, muslims and buddhists took to the street, torching houses and schools, said police lt. col. aung min. to defuse tensions, police imposed a curfew wednesday night. tension, police presence the death toll from the violence has risen to 10, said win htein, a member of parliament for the area. he described the situation as still tense despite the increased police presence. win htein, a member of opposition leader aung san suu kyi's national league of democracy, linked the unrest to feelings stirred up by clashes between buddhists and muslims in western myanmar last year. when police took two muslim shop owners to court thursday, a group of several hundred buddhists tried to attack them and threw rocks, he said. myanmar is emerging from decades of military repression to democracy, but has been plagued by bouts of ethnic violence. in the western state of rakhine, tensions between the majority buddhist community and the rohingya -- a stateless ethnic muslim group -- boiled over into clashes that killed scores of people and left tens of thousands of others living in makeshift camps last year. most of the victims were rohingya. 'grave concern' ""the ongoing intercommunal strife in rakhine state is of grave concern,"" the international crisis group said in a november report. ""and there is the potential for similar violence elsewhere, as nationalism and ethno-nationalism rise and old prejudices resurface."" a failure by authorities to address deepening divisions between the communities could result in a resumption of violence in the future, the report said, ""which would be to the detriment of both communities, and of the country as a whole."" the u.s. ambassador to myanmar, derek mitchell, said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the reports of violence in meiktila this week. u.s. diplomats are monitoring events closely, he said in a post on the embassy's facebook page. win htein, the local lawmaker, said that about 30% of the township's 100,000 residents are muslim.","the death toll from the violence rises to 10, a local lawmaker says"
"-- i grew up about 30 minutes north of boston in a town that was a virtual melting pot — i was exposed to all different backgrounds, cultures, and religions, fueling my personal interests in global issues. my teenage years were dotted by regular interactions with people like me from all around the world — people i could connect with about these issues. i was lucky to be able to expand my understanding of the world in this way. now, with the arrival of facebook, youtube and other social media, young people everywhere in the united states have an incredible opportunity to learn from their peers in other countries and partner to make a huge impact in addressing global health issues. i know how hard it can be for young people in high school, college, or just starting out, to balance schoolwork, relationships and other activities. but today is world aids day, and we should each find a way to use the moment to raise awareness about this global pandemic and unite in the fight against hiv. that's why this weekend i participated in an event with young reproductive health advocates from new york who got up early to tune into a live webcast from johannesburg, south africa. the webcast featured young leaders in the fight against hiv/aids responding to questions from the youth in new york and around the world. the conversation focused on how young people are leading the charge in hiv advocacy and prevention, and it was a part of planned parenthood global's and the global youth coalition on hiv/aids' efforts to mark world aids day on saturday. those young people include folks like brandon, 17, and lena, 19, who work with their peers at planned parenthood metro washington's ophelia egypt center. the egypt center is a community program that helps educate young people about reproductive health. brandon and lena are both giving back to their community and making sure their peers have accurate and comprehensive information about their health care. that's how we're going to fight hiv/aids -- by engaging and empowering young people to help themselves and their peers stay hiv free. this is the demographic that is most vulnerable to unintended pregnancy, stds and hiv/aids. in fact, worldwide, young people still make up about 40 percent of all new hiv infections. while we've made a lot of progress in fighting hiv, we know there is great room for improvement. in many countries around the world, young people are still often unable to access quality health care. testing and treatment can be problematic where resources and geography make it difficult. in the united states, the situation isn't much better, especially for young people. a recent centers for disease control and prevention report finds that more than half of people infected with hiv in the u.s. aged 13 to 24 don't know they have it. that same age group is responsible for more than a quarter of new u.s. infections each year. on ""glee,"" we often tackle the tough topics that young people face — in fact, my recurring character, wade ""unique"" adams, is a transgender teenager who finds herself navigating a lot of the same problems many young people face around the globe. while these challenges are different everywhere, young people now see themselves connected to the world beyond our borders. the internet, mobile technology, the 24-hour news cycle and immigration have all helped contribute to this new global identity. we are living in a world that is increasingly without borders. that's why events like the one i participated in this weekend are so important — they help open a dialogue between young health advocates in the united states and the rest of the world on what programs and policies need to be put in place. we need these global conversations if we are going to win the battle against hiv, because there is so much we can learn from one another's successes and continued challenges. of course, it won't all rest on our shoulders. some of our leaders already know just how important this issue is for young people. thanks to president barack obama, under the affordable care act, millions more people will be eligible for health insurance, including many people with hiv. in november, the u.s. preventive services task force also recommended that all americans aged 15-65 receive routine hiv testing, not just those most at risk. if finalized, this would mean insurers would have to cover hiv screening without a co-pay, saving young people some much-needed money. with new investments in medically accurate sex education and the evolution of health technology as a means to educate and communicate with more people than ever before, we have new tools to address the hiv epidemic. on world aids day and every day, there is much to be done. talk to your friends, schoolmates and family — face to face or online — about this global problem, ensure your loved ones get the information and care they need and deserve, and let your legislators know that you support policies that help young people get the care they need. it will be impossible for us to eradicate hiv as long as any corner of the world is cut off from the education

"new york (cnnmoney.com) -- is cheese the answer for cayuga county, new york? larry rosenbaum surveys the field where he hopes to build a high-end specialty cheese factory. like small towns all across america, this agricultural community is suffering, with unemployment approaching 10 percent. entrepreneur larry rosenbaum thinks he can do his part to turn things around. for a decade, the insurance man by trade has been dreaming of building a factory for high-end specialty cheese. one key selling point: his product would meet the strictest standards of the jewish and muslim faiths. rosenbaum says the demand for kosher and halal cheese is high but the selection is slim. so he's been eyeing a plot of barren farmland between aurelius and auburn -- two cayuga towns -- as the future home of a $40 million, 64,000-square-foot factory that would churn out feta and brie. the goal is for his company, saratoga cheese corp., to produce 30 million pounds of cheese in the first year and distribute it domestically and internationally. ""it's the beginning of a trend of bringing back manufacturing industry to new york,"" said rosenbaum. according to the public policy institute of new york state, manufacturing in new york declined more than 30 percent between 1997 and 2007. watch rosenbaum talk about his plans » rosenbaum estimates that saratoga cheese corp. would bring 75 factory jobs and 150 temporary construction jobs to the region. plans also include 50 yeshiva work-study students to be placed on participating farms. in addition, several rabbis and imams would supervise production. if saratoga cheese can get off the ground, it could mean a boost for local farmers like dale hemminger, who has agreed to supply kosher milk to saratoga cheese corp. hemminger says it could be a crucial new market for his milk. and though he was at first skeptical of rosenbaum's plan, hemminger says he admires rosenbaum's vision. but that vision is still $10 million short of becoming reality. rosenbaum has secured $30 million in government grants, loans and private funding, but needs $40 million before saratoga cheese corp. can break ground. given the recession, securing the final amount is proving no small feat. according to bill teator, a board member of saratoga cheese corp., the best-case scenario is a combination of investment by a kosher dairy company and private lending. teator says that though investors are confident about the business plan, the economic environment makes it tough to secure the needed cash. but support from local lawmakers is abundant. republican state sen. michael nozzolio is optimistic that saratoga cheese corp. will find a home in his 54th district. and with an estimated $140 million in local revenue hanging in the balance, there's reason to hope. recession or not, rosenbaum is steadfast in his belief. for him, it's not a question of if the factory will get built, but when. ""we're not going to quit until we make it,"" says rosenbaum. it's a persistence that is necessary in a recession that has proved legendary.",entrepreneur has long dreamed of building high-end specialty cheese factory
"-- suicide bombers are responsible for killing more than 12,000 iraqi civilians and wounding more than 30,000 since the war began, according to study released by the british medical journal lancet. the study found that 1,003 documented suicide bombings accounted for 12,284 of 108,624 iraqi civilian deaths, 11% of those killed between march 20, 2003, and december 31, 2010. it also found such attacks accounted for 30,644 -- or 26% -- of the 117,165 documented cases of iraqi civilians wounded within the same period. ""suicide bombers in iraq use suicide bombs strategically as cost-effective, precise, highly destructive weapons,"" said the study, which was published saturday. ""our findings suggest that the iraqi civilian population suffers a substantial public health burden because it is a primary chosen target of suicide bombers and those who deploy them."" the study analyzed and compared suicide bomb casualties using data compiled by iraq body count, an independent public database that documents violent iraqi deaths using hospital, morgue, nongovernmental organizations and official figures as well as media reports. ""certainly, our findings for documented casualties do not represent total deaths or injuries, because not every death or injury is reported, or linked to a suicide bombing as a cause,"" the study said. getting an accurate picture of the iraq war toll is difficult at best. the 2003 u.s.-led invasion that toppled saddam hussein saw the collapse of iraq's government, including the agencies responsible for documenting deaths. additionally, insurgent violence made hand counts by health care workers and nongovernment organizations impossible. iraq body count has been criticized by a number of people, including those who say its data is biased, undercounted or overcounted. proponents of the organization's data, which is published at icasualties.org, say it is the most reliable tally of iraqi deaths. the lancet also faced criticism for publishing a study in 2006 that found 600,000 iraqi civilians had been killed during the war. the authors' findings were widely dismissed. the latest study, which was written by madelyn hsiao-rei hicks of king's college of london, also documented the number of u.s.-led coalition forces killed in suicide bomb attacks. during the same period from 2003 to 2010, 79 documented suicide bomb attacks were responsible for the deaths of 200 coalition troops, the study found. of those troops killed, 176 were american, it said. the u.s. military said no american troops were killed in iraq in august, marking the first month without a military casualty since the invasion. but for iraqis, august was one of the more deadly months of the year. on august 15, the country was struck by a barrage of suicide bombings, car bombs and gunfights that left 84 people dead and 200 wounded. two weeks later, at least 28 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a sunni mosque in western baghdad, officials said.","new: suicide bomb attacks continue in iraq, while no u.s. fatalities reported in august"
"an unlikely group helped sen. thad cochran capture the republican nomination in a hotly contested primary runoff, but the strategy that propelled him to victory is unlikely to make it into the gop playbook. in the final weeks of the election, cochran's campaign and allies turned to african-americans and democrats to carry the incumbent senator past his tea party challenger. turnout shot up in counties with the highest african-american populations, but cochran's success with turning out an unlikely demographic will be hard to replicate elsewhere, several republican strategists said. cnn political commentator and republican strategist kevin madden emphasized that each election should be treated as an independent race with its own strategy. ""i think it would be hard to say this is a sign of something that could be replicated in congressional districts or in races around the country,"" madden, a former adviser to 2012 gop presidential candidate mitt romney, said. a unique scenario played out in mississippi: because of the state's open primary system, democrats were able to help elect the republican nominee, who is all but certain to win the general election in the solidly republican state. the contentious race between an incumbent with a pipeline to federal funds and a more conservative challenger with tea party backing jolted blacks into action -- 88% of whom voted for the democratic nominee in the state's last senate race in 2012, according to cnn exit polls. lifelong democrats mobilized for cochran states in which the same scenario could play out ""are few and far between,"" gop strategist and cnn political commentator alex castellanos said. ""until we find such a rare state, it will do a republican no good to promise more federal spending and benefits to minority voters."" bringing home the pork throughout the campaign, cochran consistently pointed out his position on the senate appropriations committee and the multimillion-dollar projects he has funded in mississippi, some of which bear his name, like the university of southern mississippi's thad cochran center. jackson, mississippi, also boasts the jackson medical mall thad cochran center -- a formerly run-down mall that an african-american doctor converted into a medical center with cochran's support, said d'andra orey, political science professor at jackson state university. ""he's done some things that are not black-specific, but things that blacks benefit from,"" orey said. many credited cochran's success at the ballot box to his ability to funnel federal dollars into his state -- the poorest in the country. henry barbour, who steered the pro-cochran super pac mississippi conservatives, said that cochran's long-standing relationships with the african-american community and ability to meet ""the needs of all the mississippians"" helped cochran win. ""it only worked because they had confidence in sen. cochran, whether it was a republican voter we were talking to, an independent voter we were talking to, or even a democratic voter,"" barbour acknowledged. but still, barbour said he does not ""think there's any question"" that the strategy can be applied on a national level. ""we've got to genuinely go into the minority communities and communicate our message and explain to them why it's good for them,"" barbour said. barbour called the election an impressive feat given the state's violent history of race relations. turnout spiked in hinds county, which is 70% african-american and saw about 7,000 more voters for cochran in the runoff than in the primary. while boasting a similar share of cochran supporters, neighboring madison county -- which is 38% african-american -- delivered much smaller gains for cochran in the runoff. george flaggs jr., the mayor of vicksburg, backed cochran and encouraged other democrats to support him at the polls, largely because his city's economy is anchored in government-funded projects. ""(sen. cochran) is a person that demonstrates leadership in terms of helping with jobs and job creation,"" flaggs said. ""i'm a black democrat, but i try to be responsive to the needs of the city and the state."" he added that mississippi would be unable to compete for federal funds with states like new york or california without cochran's seniority in the senate. barbour said he was ""damned proud"" to ask african-americans and democrats for their support. ""one of the highlights of the runoff was working with african-americans in a shared interest in our state,"" barbour said. ""this is how you grow the party."" conservative activists slam cochran for courting democrats is the african-american vote up for grabs? conservativeblackchick.com's crystal wright said the mississippi race showed that neither party should take the black vote for granted. ""we don't go out and earn the black vote,"" wright said of the gop. ""the only time the republican party is serious about going after the black vote is -- it's like the vote of last resort. blacks have become the vote of last resort and we need to say no more."" republicans could actually make inroads with african-americans in the rural and suburban communities of the south, said ravi k. perry, a political science professor at mississippi state university. perry, who has written extensively about race in politics, said cochran's outreach to blacks is ""obviously a winning strategy"" and that the runoff showed that there is interest in the african-american community to have an impact on the political process. ""it's not going to be a strategy that you're going to throw away,"" perry said. he added that many african-americans are socially conservative and may find republican candidates appealing, particularly if they can bring home federal dollars for the agriculture industry, which relies on subsidies. ""democrats should not rest on their laurels and assume that the african-american vote is theirs and the gop should not assume that it is out of their reach,"" perry said. democratic strategist and cnn political commentator donna brazile dispelled the idea that democrats take the african-american vote for granted and said that democrats are working to recruit and turn out more every election cycle. ""the only legitimate criticism ... is that we wait until the last minute to encourage african-americans to vote,"" brazile said. ""but when it comes to encouraging african-americans to run for office, we're at the table."" but brazile said the democratic senatorial campaign committee is making an ""aggressive effort"" to recruit and register african-americans and other minorities in key states this cycle dscc national press secretary justin barasky said the group is already spending to raise turnout in battleground states to near-2012 levels and will be ""making an unprecedented investment"" to keep the senate in democratic hands. registering and turning out african-americans will be a key part of this strategy, particularly in georgia, south carolina and louisiana, barasky said. forming a more inclusive party danny vargas, former chairman of the republican national hispanic assembly, was wary to draw any broader conclusions from the unique mississippi runoff, but said the race is a reminder the gop needs to cast a wider net. ""nationally, if we ever hope to win back the white house, we need to have an approach that's inclusive of every segment of society,"" vargas, who is also president of varcom solutions, said. ""the poor of our country are not the problem, they're the ones most in need of our solutions."" vargas suggested the gop should show how its market-oriented solutions can empower all types of communities. ""you just need to show up. you need to be willing to go to hispanic bodegas, black churches or mosques,"" he said. beyond african-americans, republicans will also need to draw hispanic voters to remain a viable party as that population is projected to triple by 2050. john bruce, chair of the university of mississippi's political science department, called the runoff an ""exceptional"" case and said no one should expect any significant shifts in racial partisanship. but cochran's strategy of courting the african-american vote proved successful -- whether because of his record of funding projects in mississippi or the fear of being represented by someone like mcdaniel. ""anytime something works in politics, someone else will try to copy it,"" bruce said. mcdaniel says 'hundreds' of irregularities found in mississippi race mississippi primary spending surge pushes advertisers off the air",runoff turnout shot up in counties with the highest african-american populations
"-- once investigators looking for malaysia airlines flight 370 decide to shift from listening for pings emanating from the floor of the indian ocean to poring over its terrain, they will begin drawing from a whole new set of tools. among them will be the bluefin-21, a probe equipped with side-scan sonar -- an acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound rather than light. ""that is a piece of equipment that does assist in locating where the wreckage may be,"" said sylvia earle, an oceanographer from national geographic who was chief scientist for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. a 'massive, massive task' though the discovery of four pings believed to be from the jet's so-called black boxes -- its flight data recorder and its cockpit voice recorder -- have helped investigators narrow the search area, they would still face a formidable task. ""it's a lot of terrain to cover,"" given that the bluefin-21 moves at the pace of a leisurely stroll, she told cnn. though it moves slowly, it creates good images -- so good that they are ""almost a picture of what's there ... but it's imaged with sound instead of with a camera."" listen for a ping, and the water may play tricks on you once the debris field is found, then other equipment -- such as remotely operated vehicles -- would be brought in to recover the black boxes, earle said. rovs working at depths of three miles would require power conveyed down a cable from a ship above, she said. ""there are not many pieces of equipment in the world able to do this."" and there are only a handful of countries that have manned submarines capable of descending to such depths, she said, citing the united states, russia, japan, france and china. ""having the human presence there can make a big difference,"" she said. it ""can give you a real edge in terms of understanding what's there."" the scarcity of resources ""shows how ill-prepared we are to operate in the deep sea,"" earle said. ""we've invested in aviation and aerospace, and we've been neglecting the ocean."" the time to move from listening for pings to looking for debris is fast approaching, said alan diehl, a former air force accident investigator. ""we're right on the cusp where we need to go from passive listening to active (looking) with the bluefin,"" he told cnn. that's because the batteries powering the black boxes' locator devices are probably already dead, said mary schiavo, former inspector general for the u.s. department of transportation, who noted that more than four days had elapsed since any pings were detected. ""i'm surprised that they lasted as long as they did,"" she said. the failure of searchers to find any debris linked to the plane has not surprised cnn aviation analyst david soucie, author of ""why planes crash."" the model used for tracking the debris could be incorrect, he said, noting that that was the case when investigators were searching for evidence of air france flight 447, which plunged into the southern atlantic ocean in 2009, killing all 228 people aboard. ""they spent weeks looking for debris in the wrong area,"" he said. the lack of debris could also mean that the plane did not break apart on impact, but instead sank largely intact, he said. if that was the case, it could complicate the effort to retrieve the black boxes, since they were stored inside the tail of the plane. investigators would have to dismantle the tail in order to extract them and whatever secrets they may hold. lessons from past air disasters where's the debris? how deep is deep?",probe of the ocean floor will move from ping locators to sonar
"-- the man tasked with leading the police department in sanford, florida, in the wake of the trayvon martin killing said communities should ""take a good, hard look at who is selected,"" for neighborhood watch programs. but, said sanford's interim police chief richard myers, he still supports the programs. ""neighborhood watch is at work in literally thousands of neighborhoods across the country and with no problems whatsoever,"" myers told cnn's erin burnett on tuesday. ""i think the problems emerge from who the person is and perhaps there's a cause for communities to take a good, hard look at who is selected or who volunteers. ""let's not kill the concept because of one bad, really bad outcome."" myers, a former police chief from colorado springs, colorado, took the post friday. he said he has plans to help the department that has been under the microscope since the february 26 killing of unarmed 17-year-old trayvon martin by neighborhood watch volunteer george zimmerman. martin was black; zimmerman is hispanic. ""i'm here to help the community. there's a lot of healing that has to take place,"" myers said. ""i'm here to help the department get some stability."" his predecessor, bill lee, stepped aside as chief after a vote of no-confidence by city commissioners in april, clearing the way for myers. the martin case drew nationwide protests when sanford police decided against arresting zimmerman, who told investigators he killed martin in self-defense. a special prosecutor assigned to look into martin's death ultimately brought second-degree murder charges against the 28-year-old zimmerman, who has pleaded not guilty and is out on a $150,000 bail. myers, a 35-year law enforcement veteran, acknowledged the sanford police department needs to rebuild its relationship with african-americans in the area. ""one of my major goals is to try and strengthen the relationship that sanford police have with all elements of the community, especially the african-american community,"" he said. ""in america today, there still exists a great deal of unresolved tension about race and policing and i have a particular passion for working on those issues and helping to resolve conflict. so whether or not that was a factor in this case, it certainly is a factor in some tension that exists. we're going to work on that."" myers began his career in the suburbs of detroit and chicago before becoming chief of the appleton, wisconsin, police department. after that, he took the reins of the colorado springs police department in 2007. myers resigned that post in 2011. myers is supposed to spend a three- to five-month stint leading the sanford department, city officials have said.","richard myers, a 35-year veteran, is expected to serve for three to five months"

"-- seaworld has been fined $75,000 by the occupational safety and health administration for three safety violations, including one classified as willful, after an animal trainer was killed in february. in a statement monday, cindy coe, osha's regional administrator, said that seaworld knew of the inherent risks of allowing trainers to interact with dangerous animals. ""nonetheless, it required its employees to work within the pool walls, on ledges and on shelves where they were subject to dangerous behavior by the animals,"" coe said in the statement. seaworld denied what it called ""unfounded"" allegations by the u.s. department of labor agency and said it would contest the citations. ""osha's allegations in this citation are unsupported by any evidence or precedent and reflect a fundamental lack of understanding of the safety requirements associated with marine mammal care penalties,"" a seaworld statement said monday. in february, a 12,000-pound killer whale at the orlando, florida, seaworld pulled trainer dawn brancheau, 40, underwater and killed her as horrified park visitors watched. an autopsy report showed brancheau died from drowning and traumatic injuries to her body, including her spine, ribs and head. the osha statement said the whale involved was one of three also involved in the death of an animal trainer in 1991 at a vancouver, british columbia, water park. the agency's investigation ""revealed that seaworld trainers had an extensive history of unexpected and potentially dangerous incidents involving killer whales at its various facilities, including its location in orlando,"" the osha statement said.

"-- in 2007 and 2008, the american economy suffered through its greatest crisis since the great depression. the treasury department estimates that from 2007 to 2009, the heart of the great recession, more than 8.8 million american jobs disappeared and more than $19 trillion in household wealth was lost. in response to the crisis, the federal government took steps to reform our financial system, most significantly, passage of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. signed into law by president barack obama four years ago monday, this bill was designed to improve accountability and transparency in our financial system, ensuring we never again face a financial crisis of this magnitude. regrettably, dodd-frank has done little to address the root causes of this crisis. instead, by institutionalizing bailouts and undermining a competitive and fair marketplace, this law has joined obamacare as another example of big government overreach that has ultimately done more harm than good for the american people. wall street reform law only half done at 849 pages, dodd-frank touches nearly every aspect of our financial system, from capital ratios of large financial institutions down to new rules on the credit cards most americans have in their wallets. dodd-frank has only grown larger since obama signed it. much of the statutory text tasks washington bureaucrats with writing nearly 400 rules. as of the first of this month, law firm davis polk reported 45% of rulemaking deadlines have been missed. since its enactment, dodd-frank has imposed $21.8 billion in compliance costs while producing regulations that require nearly 60 million hours of paperwork with which to comply, according to estimates by the american action forum, a center-right policy institute. these compliance costs can be devastating to small community banks and credit unions. often they are the only financial institutions serving small towns and rural areas such as those throughout my district in western north carolina. assuming these small institutions can withstand this dodd-frank-induced regulatory onslaught and stay in business, they will join larger banks in passing these added costs along to consumers, driving up the cost of borrowing and reducing access to much-needed credit. among the great indignities of the financial crisis: american families were footing the bill for the massive taxpayer-funded bailouts of fannie mae, freddie mac and other large financial institutions while struggling to scrape by in the broken economy. in 2009, bloomberg estimated that the u.s. government and other federal agencies had committed nearly $13 trillion to support these failing institutions. the nearly $13 trillion represented 90% of the u.s. gross domestic product for 2008. in signing the law, obama claimed that never again would the american people foot the bill for these large firms. yet amazingly dodd-frank does not just fail to end these bailouts, it cements them into law and greatly increases the likelihood the american people will be stuck with the federal government's bailout tab again in the future. in addition to an alphabet soup of new agencies, such as fsoc (financial stability oversight council) and ofr (office of financial research), dodd-frank also gave us the consumer financial protection bureau, a uniquely (some might say dangerously) unaccountable addition to our federal bureaucracy. designed with the noble goal of consumer protection, the agency was given significant power to regulate financial offerings but was designed in a manner to leave it free of oversight from both the white house and congress. among the agency's ""accomplishments"" is its qualified mortgage rule that has negatively affected credit availability in the mortgage market. the rule has especially harmed those who have typically struggled to access credit in the past, women and minorities. a recent report from the federal reserve board showed roughly one-third of black and hispanic borrowers would not qualify for mortgages under the rule. even more troubling is the bureau's latest project, the national mortgage database. in an apparent effort to make the national security agency jealous, this database will track individual americans and their personally identifiable information, including the most intimate personal and financial details, going back as far as 30 years. and this does not even begin to address the consumer agency's management failures that have led to claims of discrimination and retaliation against minority employees going unpunished and spending $216 million to renovate its rented office space. put simply, dodd-frank is but another failed big government ""reform"" -- just like obamacare, the troubled asset relief program, or tarp, and the stimulus. when will this administration realize more government does not solve problems, it is the problem?

"-- the leader of the socialist pasok party in greece is starting efforts to build a government, his party said, making him the third greek politician since sunday to try to do so. pasok leader evangelos venizelos held meetings with the leader of the democratic left party, fotis kouvelis, in what venizelos called a ""first step"" toward assembling a coalition of pro-european parties. he is scheduled to hold talks with head of the center-right new democracy party, antonis samaras, on friday. samaras and another potential coalition partner -- alexis tsipras of the leftist syriza party -- have tried and failed to organize a government already. if no one can pull together a coalition, and no national unity government can be formed by may 17, greece must call new elections. venizelos, who has three days to cobble together a deal, said sunday's fragmented results show voters don't trust ""any party on its own."" but he says he wants greece to stay in the eurozone, the group of 17 european countries that use a common currency. ""it is a given that we want greece in the euro,"" he said. ""we want something better, not something worse."" read why greece will muddle through crisis greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts. the election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures. voters backed parties on the far left and right, withholding support from pasok and new democracy, the more moderate parties that made up the coalition that enacted the cuts. seven parties won seats in parliament in sunday's election, but no party captured more than 19% of the vote. as tsipras began coalition talks tuesday, he said pasok and new democracy ""don't have a majority any more to vote for the plundering of the greek people."" pasok placed third in the election, behind new democracy and syriza. the latest opinion poll, by marc-alpha tv, suggests that if new elections are held, syriza would come out on top, with nearly 24% of the vote, followed by new democracy with 17.4% and pasok with just under 11%. a coalition would still need to be formed. extreme-right party golden dawn would take a smaller share of a second vote than on sunday, the poll suggests, but would still pass the threshold to have lawmakers in parliament. a european commission spokeswoman said this week that greece needs time to work through its political process, but she reminded the country's leaders that they would be expected to abide by the terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown. ""the commission hopes and expects that the future government of greece will respect the engagements that greece has entered into,"" spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen told reporters. new democracy ended up with 108 seats in greece's 300-seat parliament. voters also delivered a rebuke to pasok, leaving it with 41 of the 160 seats it held before sunday's vote. together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue their coalition, requiring formation of a new government. last year, greece's debt threatened to force it to drop europe's common currency, the euro, prompting the european central bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. in exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. the resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits -- and significant public outcry. read why greece shouldn't be allowed to sink the national unemployment rate for january, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work. youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work. for two years, the country's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the eurozone. greece pushed through a huge debt swap in march to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the european union, the european central bank and the international monetary fund, worth â‚¬130 billion ($171.5 billion). the debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as spain and italy. cnn's antonia mortensen and matthew chance and journalist elinda labropoulou contributed to this report.","new: socialist leader venizelos calls talks a ""first step"" toward a coalition"
"-- new data released thursday suggests that the arctic ocean will be ""largely ice free"" during summer within a decade. as the arctic sea ice melts, polar bears face extinction. the report, complied by the uk-based catlin arctic survey and the world wildlife fund (wwf), is the latest research into ice thickness in the arctic. researchers predict that within 20 years ice cover will be completely gone during the warmer months. the expedition, which was completed in may, was led by uk explorer pen hadow. he and his team collected data by manually drilling into the ice and noting its thickness along a 450-kilometer route across the northern part of the beaufort sea. they found that the area surveyed was comprised almost exclusively of first year ice. scientists think this is significant because traditionally the region has been made up of much older, thicker ice. ""discovering this area of younger ice provides another body of information that supports the rapidly emerging scientific consensus that it's going to be nearer 10 years from now that we will see roughly 80-85 percent free waters in the arctic ocean,"" hadow told cnn. measurements taken by hadow and his team report that the ice-floes were on average 1.8 meters thick -- which, according to scientists, is too thin to survive next summer's ice melt. professor peter wadhams, head of the polar ocean physics group at the uk's university of cambridge said: ""with a large part of the region now first year ice, it is clearly more vulnerable. the area is now more likely to become open water each summer, bringing forward the potential date when the summer sea ice will be completely gone."" professor wadhams, who has analyzed the expedition data, added: ""the catlin arctic survey data supports the new consensus view that the arctic will be ice-free in summer within about 20 years, and much of that decrease will be happening within 10 years."" click here to see pictures of the expedition » martin sommerkorn from the wwf international arctic program believes that the changes in sea-ice cover in the region are likely to increase global temperatures further.

"-- long a pillar of hosni mubarak's three-decade rule over egypt, omar suleiman now sits at the top of the pyramid as its de facto president. under pressure from street demonstrations calling for his ouster, mubarak named his veteran spymaster to the long-vacant vice presidency in late january. suleiman quickly became the face of the government's reform pledges, announcing talks with opposition leaders and promising swift reforms. but mubarak's february 1 announcement that he would step down when his term ends in september failed to satisfy the crowds in cairo's tahrir square and other cities. attacks on demonstrators by pro-government crowds in the following days failed to dislodge the demonstrators, whose ranks were bolstered when thousands of workers in several industries went on strike thursday. after a day of intense speculation, mubarak repeated that he would remain in office to serve out his term -- but he announced that he was delegating power to suleiman, who quickly urged egyptians to go home and get back to work. ""we call upon you to unite, and to think rationally and to look forward to the future,"" suleiman said in a televised speech that followed mubarak's. but the vice president, whose agents are among the fingers of mubarak's iron hand, wasn't seen as much of an improvement by opposition figures. ""mubarak is only one part of this regime,"" human rights activist gigi ibrahim, one of the tahrir square protesters, said. ""people have been here for 17 days, and they are not for suleiman either. mubarak has lost all legitimacy, and now him handing over the power to the vice president is as illegitimate as mubarak being in power."" and in alexandria, protesters met the announcement with chants of ""no to mubarak, no to suleiman."" a former general who trained under both the united states and soviet union during the cold war, suleiman took over egypt's mukhabarat intelligence agency in 1993. he is credited with leading mubarak's efforts to crush an islamic insurgency in the 1990s. that earned him the ear of western intelligence officials thirsting for vital information about regional terrorist groups, and he became a key intermediary in israeli-palestinian peace talks. ""he is basically your main go-to guy in egypt,"" former deputy cia director john mclaughlin said. suleiman has been ""helpful in many arenas,"" including the israeli-palestinian peace process. mclaughlin said. a 2006 cable from the u.s. embassy in cairo, disclosed by the wikileaks website in january, called intelligence collaboration with suleiman ""probably the most successful element"" of the u.s. relationship with egypt. but that relationship is ""a little like being in bed with the mafia,"" author ron suskind told cnn's ""parker spitzer."" ""if someone knocks on your door at night and you disappear, omar suleiman is probably behind it,"" said suskind, whose 2006 book ""the one percent doctrine"" detailed the bush administration's post-9/11 counterterrorism policies. ""he is a feared man, and certainly not a man with any legitimacy when it comes to rule of law or any of the principles we prized in america."" in 2002, al qaeda captive ibn al-shaykh al-libi ""was tortured rather dramatically"" by suleiman's agents, suskind said, yielding a ""confession"" that iraq had trained the terrorist group in the use of chemical and biological weapons. his assertion was a key point in the bush administration's arguments for the 2003 invasion of iraq, but he recanted it once back in u.s. hands. that sort of history leaves an opening for critics to question u.s. support for democratic change in egypt, suskind said. ""the fact is, we are allied with the people they're trying to overthrow, and right now the united states hasn't done much to separate those bonds,"" he said. suleiman had long been mentioned as a possible successor to mubarak, along with the aging ruler's son, gamal. a 2007 u.s. cable called his loyalty to mubarak ""rock solid,"" and some analysts viewed his vice presidential appointment as a way for mubarak to make a graceful exit. suleiman is even credited with saving mubarak's life. on a state visit to ethiopia in 1995, mubarak was to have traveled in a normal vehicle but suleiman insisted that the president's armored mercedes be flown in from cairo. accounts of an assassination attempt on mubarak vary but it's believed that suleiman was sitting next to mubarak when a hail of bullets pinged off the car. the bond forged that day cemented their relationship. but suleiman's attempts at dialogue with opposition parties were derided by protesters, and the obama administration criticized the talks for including too few opposition groups. vice president joe biden told suleiman on tuesday that egypt needed ""immediate, irreversible progress"" toward meeting protesters' demands, and leading opposition figure mohamed elbaradei said suleiman and mubarak ""are twins."" ""this is an act of deception at a grand scale,"" elbaradei said. nathan brown, a professor of middle eastern politics at george washington university, said mubarak's thursday speech did him little good. not only was it too little, too late, he said, but his announcement that he was ceding power to suleiman was buried in an ""incredibly patronizing"" speech. ""had he done this a couple of weeks ago, it actually may have done something,"" brown said. but now, he said, ""all the constitutional, legal tools are in their hands, and it doesn't' do them any good. so i don't think they're sure what to do."" cnn's matt smith, saad abedine and moni basu contributed to this report.","omar suleiman, the former intelligence chief, now wields most power in egypt"

""the only thing that was on my mind was, 'i want to play for india one day,' and i was pretty sure and confident that one day i will,"" he told cnn in mumbai. in fact he made his test debut for india at the age of 16 facing pakistan's fearsome bowling attack, just two years after making his first-class debut for mumbai. despite a baptism of fire in that first international match and getting hit on the mouth by a ball from waquar younis, he took his own game forward and has become known for the positivity of his play and the compact efficiency and brilliance of his shot-making. making his first test hundred at the age of 17 against england he has racked up the records in a 19-year career. in 2000 he became the first batsman to score 50 international hundreds, and is the highest scorer in one day internationals. he joined an elite group in 2007 when he became only the third player to pass 11,000 runs in test cricket. nicknames in cricket are common, but only if you're a really exceptional player do you get one that's complementary. tendulkar has joined that elite as the ""little master"" which sits nicely next to other great batsmen, viv ""master blaster"" richards and brian ""the prince"" lara. but perhaps no higher praise came from australian cricketing legend donald bradman who once said that tendulkar was the only player that reminded him of himself. like all sportsmen he's suffered from injury, and now 35-years-old, many are wondering if his best days are behind him. playing for india against england and australia last summer and at the beginning of 2008, many commentators thought that his normal aggression and daring were missing from his game. his form was also heavily criticized after the 2007 world cup, and injury forced him out of the international series against south africa. but for the man used to batting away tricky deliveries, this criticism gets a typical positive response: ""i'm not one to dwell on the past. i like to move forward and these challenges, these hurdles in between, they bring the best out of me. they motivate me even more."" he's currently facing the challenges of the rapid-fire version of the game in the indian premier league (ipl), masterminded by lalit modi, that despite it's glitz and hype has been criticized for losing some of the finer points of the sport. ""it's so full of excitement. i personally don't feel that it's dumbing-down the game. it's just another version of cricket. if the game is going to be globalized in the form of ipl, then why not? it's better for cricket,"" he told cnn.",india's best known cricketer is one of the games best-ever batsmen
"-- u.s. presidential contender barack obama used a speech thursday in berlin -- the german city that once symbolized cold war division --- to warn about the dangers of allowing new walls to come between the united states and its allies. barack obama presses the flesh in germany after his speech in berlin's tiergarten park. obama highlighted what he sees as common transatlantic goals while also accepting the differences of the bush years. he is on the latest leg of an international trip intended to bolster his foreign policy credentials at home and set out his vision for a new era of transatlantic cooperation. in an echo of former president ronald reagan's speech when he demanded the berlin wall be pulled down, obama said: ""the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand. the walls between races and tribes; natives and immigrants; christian and muslim and jew cannot stand. these now are the walls we must tear down."" obama introduced himself to the berlin crowd as a proud u.s. citizen and a ""fellow citizen of the world."" he said: ""this city, of all cities, knows the dream of freedom. and you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and women from both of our nations came together to work, and struggle, and sacrifice for that better life."" watch obama in germany » he touched on issues that have generally divided europe and the u.s. such as climate change as well as comparing berlin's cold war struggle with today's international challenges like fighting terrorism. ""people of the world - look at berlin, where a wall came down, a continent came together, and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one,"" he said. obama said: ""while the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history."" he said the fall of the berlin wall offered hope as the world faces up to international challenges such as terrorism, climate change and loose nukes ""in this new world, such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them. that is why we cannot afford to be divided,"" obama said. he also addressed differences between the u.s. and europe but added: ""in europe, the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world, rather than a force to help make it right, has become all too common. ""in america, there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europe's role in our security and our future. both views miss the truth... ""in this new century, americans and europeans alike will be required to do more - not less. partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice; it is the one way, the only way, to protect our common security and advance our common humanity."" turning to global warming, obama said: ""this is the moment when we must come together to save this planet. ""let us resolve that we will not leave our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands. let us resolve that all nations - including my own - will act with the same seriousness of purpose as has your nation, and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere."" cnn's christiane amanpour said despite the pro-obama crowd who gathered at the victory column in berlin's tiergarten park hours before the speech, many had serious questions about his policies. tucker bounds, a spokesman for obama's republican rival john mccain, said: ""john mccain has dedicated his life to serving, improving and protecting america. barack obama spent an afternoon talking about it."" obama earlier played down suggestions he was delivering a campaign speech but conceded that his performance was intended as much for an american audience as for the gathering german crowds. he had originally hoped to speak in front of the iconic brandenburg gate, where u.s. president john f. kennedy was photographed during a visit in 1963 shortly after the berlin wall had been built. expressing solidarity with the people of the divided city during the same trip, kennedy declared ""ich bin ein berliner."" the gate was also the site of a speech by u.s. president ronald reagan in 1987 in which he memorably urged soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to ""tear down"" the wall. but use of the landmark was apparently vetoed by german chancellor angela merkel, who a spokesman wednesday said disapproved of plans to co-opt it as a ""campaign backdrop."" cnn european political editor robin oakley said obama enjoyed widespread popularity in europe, partly because of his optimism and partly because he is not president george w. bush. watch how europe compares the two candidates » but oakley said obama needed to prove to americans that he could defend u.s. interests abroad. republican rival john mccain's campaign team has frequently criticized obama as being inexperienced on foreign policy and a recent poll suggested just 48 percent of americans thought he would make a good commander in chief, compared to 72 percent for mccain. germany's ties with the bush administration have warmed since a fallout over the iraq war, which germany opposed. germany and the u.s. have also disagreed over nato member germany's refusal to send troops into combat zones in southern afghanistan. oakley said european leaders would be seeking confirmation that obama, if elected, would be a ""listening president."" in addition to merkel, obama is slated to meet with british prime minister gordon brown and opposition leader david cameron as well as french president nicolas sarkozy. obama's arrival in europe follows earlier stopovers in afghanistan, iraq, jordan, kuwait, israel and the palestinian territories. he says he is making the trip as a u.s. senator rather than a presidential contender.",u.s. presidential candidate barack obama gives speech in germany
